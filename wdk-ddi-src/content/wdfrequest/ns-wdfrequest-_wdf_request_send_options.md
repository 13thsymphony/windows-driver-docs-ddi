# _WDF_REQUEST_SEND_OPTIONS structure



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]

The <b>WDF_REQUEST_SEND_OPTIONS</b> structure specifies options that are associated with sending an I/O request to an I/O target.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _WDF_REQUEST_SEND_OPTIONS {
  ULONG    Size;
  ULONG    Flags;
  LONGLONG Timeout;
} WDF_REQUEST_SEND_OPTIONS, *PWDF_REQUEST_SEND_OPTIONS;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Size

The size, in bytes, of this structure.


### -field Flags

A bitwise OR of <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ne-wudfddi_types-_wdf_request_send_options_flags.md">WDF_REQUEST_SEND_OPTIONS_FLAGS</a>-typed flags.


### -field Timeout

A time-out value, in system time units (100-nanosecond intervals). If the driver has set the WDF_REQUEST_SEND_OPTION_TIMEOUT flag, the framework cancels the associated I/O request if it is not completed within the specified time-out period. The time-out value can be negative, positive, or zero, as follows:

<ul>
<li>
If the value is negative, the expiration time is relative to the current system time.

</li>
<li>
If the value is positive, the expiration time is specified as an absolute time (which is actually relative to January 1, 1601). 

</li>
<li>
If the value is zero, the framework does not time out the request.

</li>
</ul>
Relative expiration times are not affected by any changes to the system time that might occur within the specified time-out period. Absolute expiration times do reflect system time changes.

The framework provides <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/E7D5564D-7BAA-412E-959F-3655B963B4C1">time conversion functions</a> that convert time values into system time units.

If the framework cancels an I/O request because the specified time-out period has elapsed, the framework provides a completion status of STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT for the I/O request. However, after the time-out period elapses, the I/O target might complete the I/O request before the framework is able to cancel it. In that case, the I/O request's completion status will not be STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT.




## -remarks
The <b>WDF_REQUEST_SEND_OPTIONS</b> structure is passed to object methods that send an I/O request to an I/O target, such as the <a href="..\wdfrequest\nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestsend.md">WdfRequestSend</a> method. The structure must be initialized by calling the <a href="..\wdfrequest\nf-wdfrequest-wdf_request_send_options_init.md">WDF_REQUEST_SEND_OPTIONS_INIT</a> and <a href="..\wdfrequest\nf-wdfrequest-wdf_request_send_options_set_timeout.md">WDF_REQUEST_SEND_OPTIONS_SET_TIMEOUT</a> functions.

If the driver is sending the request synchronously, we recommend that the driver set a time-out value and the time-out flag in the <b>Flags</b> member of this structure.
