# WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost function
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF only]

The <b>WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost</b> method completes a specified I/O request and supplies a completion status. It also specifies a value that the system can use to boost the run-time priority of the thread that requested the I/O operation.

## Syntax

````
VOID WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost(
  _In_ WDFREQUEST Request,
  _In_ NTSTATUS   Status,
  _In_ CCHAR      PriorityBoost
);
````

## Parameters

`Request`

A handle to the framework request object that represents the I/O request that is being completed.

`Status`

An <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7792201b-63bb-4db5-803d-2af02893d505">NTSTATUS value</a> that represents the completion status of the request. Valid status values include, but are not limited to, the following:





#### STATUS_SUCCESS

The driver successfully completed the request.



#### STATUS_CANCELLED

The driver canceled the request.



#### STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL

The driver encountered an error while processing the request.

`PriorityBoost`

A system-defined constant value by which to increment the run-time priority of the original thread that requested the operation. Constant values are device-type-specific and are defined in <i>Wdm.h</i>. The format for the constant names is <i>XXX</i>_INCREMENT. For more information about priority boost values, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9a501ca1-58c9-4458-b202-9581f8ce5e5f">Specifying Priority Boosts When Completing I/O Requests</a>.


## Return Value

None.

A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.

## Remarks

Your driver should call <b>WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost</b> if you want to override the default priority boost that the framework provides. For example, the driver might set the priority boost to IO_NO_INCREMENT if it was able to complete the request quickly, perhaps because it detected an error. 

After a call to <b>WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost</b> returns, the request handle is no longer valid unless the driver has called <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548758">WdfObjectReference</a> to add one or more additional reference counts to the request object. Note that after <b>WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost</b> returns, the driver must not attempt to access the associated WDM IRP structure, even if it has called <b>WdfObjectReference</b>.

For more information about calling <b>WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost</b>, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/completing-i-o-requests">Completing I/O Requests</a>.


#### Examples

The following code example shows how the example at <a href="..\wdfrequest\nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcomplete.md">WdfRequestComplete</a> can use <b>WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost</b> instead of <b>WdfRequestComplete</b>.

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>switch (params.Type) {
    case WdfRequestTypeRead:
        length = params.Parameters.Read.Length;
        direction = WdfDmaDirectionReadFromDevice;
        break;
    case WdfRequestTypeWrite:
        length = params.Parameters.Write.Length;
        direction = WdfDmaDirectionWriteToDevice;
        break;
    default:
        WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost(
                                            Request,
                                            STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER,
                                            IO_NO_INCREMENT
                                            );
        return;
    }</pre>
