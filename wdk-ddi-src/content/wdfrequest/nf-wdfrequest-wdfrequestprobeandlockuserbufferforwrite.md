# WdfRequestProbeAndLockUserBufferForWrite function
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF only]

The <b>WdfRequestProbeAndLockUserBufferForWrite</b> method verifies that an I/O request's user-mode buffer is writeable, and then it locks the buffer's physical memory pages so drivers in the driver stack can write into the buffer.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS WdfRequestProbeAndLockUserBufferForWrite(
  _In_  WDFREQUEST Request,
  _In_  PVOID      Buffer,
  _In_  size_t     Length,
  _Out_ WDFMEMORY  *MemoryObject
);
````

## Parameters

`Request`

A handle to a framework request object.

`Buffer`

A pointer to the request's output buffer. For more information, see the following Remarks section.

`Length`

The length, in bytes, of the request's output buffer.

`MemoryObject`

A pointer to a location that receives a handle to a framework memory object that represents the user output buffer.


## Return Value

<b>WdfRequestProbeAndLockUserBufferForWrite</b>  returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this method might return one of the following values:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
An input parameter is invalid.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_USER_BUFFER</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The <i>Length</i> parameter is zero.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_REQUEST</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The request has already been completed or is otherwise invalid.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The current thread is not the creator of the I/O request.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
There is insufficient memory to complete the operation.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

This method might also return other <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557697">NTSTATUS values</a>.




A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.

## Remarks

The user output buffer typically receives information that the driver has read from the device.

Only a top-level driver can call the <b>WdfRequestProbeAndLockUserBufferForWrite</b> method, because the method requires the process context of the process that created the I/O request.

The user-mode buffer that the <i>Buffer</i> parameter specifies can be the buffer that <a href="..\wdfrequest\nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestretrieveunsafeuseroutputbuffer.md">WdfRequestRetrieveUnsafeUserOutputBuffer</a> retrieves, or it can be a different user-mode output buffer. For example, an I/O control code that uses the buffered access method might pass a structure that contains an embedded pointer to a user-mode buffer. In such a case, the driver can use<b>WdfRequestProbeAndLockUserBufferForWrite</b> to obtain a memory object for the buffer. 

The buffer length that the <i>Length</i> parameter specifies must not be larger than the buffer's actual size. Otherwise, drivers can access memory outside of the buffer, which is a security risk.

If <b>WdfRequestProbeAndLockUserBufferForWrite</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS, the driver receives a handle to a framework memory object that represents the user-mode buffer. To access the buffer, the driver must call <a href="..\wdfmemory\nf-wdfmemory-wdfmemorygetbuffer.md">WdfMemoryGetBuffer</a>.
