# WdfRequestCompleteWithInformation function



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]

The <b>WdfRequestCompleteWithInformation</b> method stores completion information and then completes a specified I/O request with a supplied completion status.



## -syntax

````
VOID WdfRequestCompleteWithInformation(
  _In_ WDFREQUEST Request,
  _In_ NTSTATUS   Status,
  _In_ ULONG_PTR  Information
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Request [in]

A handle to the request object.


### -param Status [in]

An <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7792201b-63bb-4db5-803d-2af02893d505">NTSTATUS value</a> that represents the completion status of the request. Valid status values include, but are not limited to, the following:




### -param STATUS_SUCCESS

The driver successfully completed the request.


### -param STATUS_CANCELLED

The driver canceled the request.


### -param STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL

The driver encountered an error while processing the request.

</dd>
</dl>

### -param Information [in]

Driver-defined completion status information for the request, such as the number of bytes that were transferred.


## -returns
None.

A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.




## -remarks
Calling <b>WdfRequestCompleteWithInformation</b> is equivalent to calling <a href="..\wdfrequest\nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestsetinformation.md">WdfRequestSetInformation</a> and then calling <a href="..\wdfrequest\nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcomplete.md">WdfRequestComplete</a>.

After a call to <b>WdfRequestCompleteWithInformation</b> returns, the request handle is no longer valid unless the driver has called <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548758">WdfObjectReference</a> to add one or more additional reference counts to the request object. Note that after <b>WdfRequestCompleteWithInformation</b> returns, the driver must not attempt to access the associated WDM IRP structure, even if it has called <b>WdfObjectReference</b>.

When your driver calls <b>WdfRequestCompleteWithInformation</b>, the framework supplies a default value that the system uses to boost the run-time priority of the thread that requested the I/O operation. For information about default priority boost values, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9a501ca1-58c9-4458-b202-9581f8ce5e5f">Specifying Priority Boosts When Completing I/O Requests</a>. Your driver can call <a href="..\wdfrequest\nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcompletewithpriorityboost.md">WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost</a> to override the default priority boost value.

For more information about calling <b>WdfRequestCompleteWithInformation</b>, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ec5aef7a-110e-430c-902d-669ccc7095ac">Completing I/O Requests</a>.

The following code example shows how a driver for a USB device might call <b>WdfRequestCompleteWithInformation</b> in a <a href="..\wdfrequest\nc-wdfrequest-evt_wdf_request_completion_routine.md">CompletionRoutine</a> callback function .
