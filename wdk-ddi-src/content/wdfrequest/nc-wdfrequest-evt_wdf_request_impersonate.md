# EVT_WDF_REQUEST_IMPERSONATE function
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to UMDF only]

A driver's <i>EvtRequestImpersonate</i> event callback function performs tasks at the requested impersonation level, such as opening a protected file.

## Syntax

```
EVT_WDF_REQUEST_IMPERSONATE EvtWdfRequestImpersonate;

void EvtWdfRequestImpersonate(
  WDFREQUEST Request,
  PVOID Context
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Request`

A handle to a framework request object that represents the I/O request that requires impersonation.

`Context`

A pointer to a context that was previously supplied in the <a href="..\wdfrequest\nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestimpersonate.md">WdfRequestImpersonate</a> method. This parameter is optional and can be NULL if a context is not required.


## Return Value

This callback function does not return a value.

## Remarks

User-Mode Driver Framework (UMDF) does not allow a driver's <i>EvtRequestImpersonate</i> callback function to call any of the framework's object methods. This ensures that the driver does not expose the impersonation level to other driver callback functions or other drivers.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/02EA93CE-3C4D-4F6F-8E58-DD78EBDB19DE">Handling Client Impersonation in UMDF Drivers</a>.
