# PFN_WDFREQUESTRETRIEVEACTIVITYID function



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to UMDF only]

The <b>WdfRequestRetrieveActivityId</b> method retrieves the current activity identifier associated with an I/O request.



## -syntax

````
NTSTATUS WdfRequestRetrieveActivityId(
  _In_  WDFREQUEST Request,
  _Out_ LPGUID     ActivityId
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Request [in]

A handle to a framework request object.


### -param ActivityId [out]

A pointer to a location to store the retrieved GUID.


## -returns
If the operation succeeds, <b>WdfRequestRetrieveActivityId</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS. Additional return values include:
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_NOT_FOUND</b></dt>
</dl>No activity ID is associated with the request.

 

The method might return other <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557697">NTSTATUS values</a>.


## -remarks
Requests reflected from kernel mode have an activity identifier available only if the Kernel Trace provider is enabled or if the UMDF driver called <a href="..\wdfrequest\nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestsetactivityid.md">WdfRequestSetActivityId</a> after receiving the request. For more information about Event Tracing for Windows (ETW), see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3de69436-671b-46a2-8d92-4eb3af2a4233">Event Tracing</a>.

Requests initiated by the UMDF driver have an activity identifier available only if the UMDF driver previously called  <a href="..\wdfrequest\nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestsetactivityid.md">WdfRequestSetActivityId</a>.

The framework does not clear a request's activity identifier when the driver calls <a href="..\wdfrequest\nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestreuse.md">WdfRequestReuse</a>.

For more information about activity identifiers, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2B70953F-5192-4654-9506-6A84373D20B4">Using Activity Identifiers</a>.
