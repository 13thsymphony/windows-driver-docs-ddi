# WdfRequestSetUserModeDriverInitiatedIo function
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to UMDF only]

The <b>WdfRequestSetUserModeDriverInitiatedIo</b> method indicates to kernel-mode drivers that sit below the UMDF driver in the same device stack that a particular request should be treated as though it came from a UMDF driver.

## Syntax

````
void WdfRequestSetUserModeDriverInitiatedIo(
  _In_ WDFREQUEST Request,
  _In_ BOOLEAN    IsUserModeDriverInitiated
);
````

## Parameters

`Request`

A handle to a framework request object.

`IsUserModeDriverInitiated`

A Boolean value that, if <b>TRUE</b>, indicates that the request should be treated as though it was initiated by a UMDF driver. If <b>FALSE</b>, this parameter indicates that the request should be treated as though it came from an application.


## Return Value

This method does not return a value.

## Remarks

If a UMDF driver calls this method with the <i>IsUserModeDriverInitiated</i> parameter set to <b>TRUE</b>, the framework sets the <b>IRP_UM_DRIVER_INITIATED_IO</b> flag in the <b>Flags</b> member of the WDM <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_irp.md">IRP</a> structure before forwarding the request to kernel-mode drivers.

A kernel-mode driver that resides below the UMDF driver in the same device stack can check for this flag to determine if the request should be treated as though initiated by a UMDF driver.

This flag is not applicable to kernel-mode drivers that might receive a request from a UMDF driver via a file-handle I/O target or a Win32 I/O target.

A UMDF driver might set the <i>IsUserModeDriverInitiated</i> parameter to <b>TRUE</b> for a request that came from an application if the driver has validated the request.

Requests that the driver created on its own are already marked as having originated from a UMDF driver.
