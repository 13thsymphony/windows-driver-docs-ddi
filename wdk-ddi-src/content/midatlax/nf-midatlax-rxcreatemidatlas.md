# RxCreateMidAtlas function



## -description
<b>RxCreateMidAtlas</b> allocates a new instance of MID_ATLAS data structure and initializes it. 


## -syntax

````
PRX_MID_ATLAS RxCreateMidAtlas(
   USHORT MaximumNumberOfMids,
   USHORT MidsAllocatedAtStart
);
````


## -parameters

### -param MaximumNumberOfMids 

The maximum number of multiplex IDs (MIDs) to be allowed in the atlas.

### -param MidsAllocatedAtStart 

The number of multiplex IDs allocated initially.

## -returns
<b>RxCreateMidAtlas</b> returns a pointer to allocated and initialized MID_ATLAS data structure on success or a <b>NULL</b> pointer on failure. 

## -remarks
RDBSS defines a Multiplex ID (MID), a 16-bit value, that can be used by both the network client (mini-redirector) and the server to distinguish between the concurrently active requests on any connection. 

The MID must be efficiently able to manage the unique tagging and identification of a number of MIDs (typically 50) from a possible combination of 65,536 values. In order to ensure a proper time space tradeoff, the lookup is organized as a three level hierarchy. The 16 bits used to represent a MID are split up into three bitfields. The length of the rightmost field (least significant ) is decided by the maximum number of MIDs that are to be allowed in the atlas. This maximum value is a parameter passed to <b>RxCreateMidAtlas </b>when the MID_ATLAS data structure is created. The remaining length is split up equally between the next two fields. 

For example, if a maximum of 50 MIDs are to be allocated on creation , the length of the first field is 6 (64 ( 2 ** 6 ) is greater than 50 ). The remaining length is split into two fields of 5 bits each.

<b>RxCreateMidAtlas</b> allocates non-paged pool memory when creating a new MID_ATLAS data structure.
