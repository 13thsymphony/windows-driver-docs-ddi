# WdfMemoryCreateFromLookaside function
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF only]

The <b>WdfMemoryCreateFromLookaside</b> method creates a framework memory object and obtains a memory buffer from a specified lookaside list.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS WdfMemoryCreateFromLookaside(
  _In_  WDFLOOKASIDE Lookaside,
  _Out_ WDFMEMORY    *Memory
);
````

## Parameters

`Lookaside`

A handle to a framework lookaside-list object that is obtained by calling <a href="..\wdfmemory\nf-wdfmemory-wdflookasidelistcreate.md">WdfLookasideListCreate</a>.

`Memory`

A pointer to a location that receives a handle to the new framework memory object.


## Return Value

<b>WdfMemoryCreateFromLookaside</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this method return one of the following values:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
An invalid parameter was detected.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
There was insufficient memory.

</td>
</tr>
</table> 

This method also might return other <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557697">NTSTATUS values</a>.

A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.

## Remarks

After your driver calls <a href="..\wdfmemory\nf-wdfmemory-wdflookasidelistcreate.md">WdfLookasideListCreate</a> to create a lookaside-list object, the driver can call <b>WdfMemoryCreateFromLookaside</b> to obtain a buffer from the lookaside list. 

The framework provides a handle to a memory object that represents the buffer. When the framework creates the memory object, it uses object attributes that the driver supplied when it called <b>WdfMemoryCreateFromLookaside</b>.

When your driver has finished using a memory object that it obtained from a lookaside list, the driver must call <a href="..\wdfobject\nf-wdfobject-wdfobjectdelete.md">WdfObjectDelete</a> to return the memory object to the lookaside list.

For more information about framework memory objects and lookaside lists, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/using-memory-buffers">Using Memory Buffers</a>.

If lookaside-list buffers are being allocated from the pageable memory pool, the <b>WdfMemoryCreateFromLookaside</b> method must be called at IRQL &lt;= APC_LEVEL. Otherwise, the method can be called at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL.
