# _WDFMEMORY_OFFSET structure
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]

The <b>WDFMEMORY_OFFSET</b> structure identifies a subsection of a memory object's buffer.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _WDFMEMORY_OFFSET {
  size_t BufferOffset;
  size_t BufferLength;
} WDFMEMORY_OFFSET, *PWDFMEMORY_OFFSET;
````

## Members


`BufferLength`

The length, in bytes, of the buffer's subsection. A value of zero represents the entire buffer.

`BufferOffset`

A byte offset from the beginning of the memory object's buffer. This offset identifies the location of the buffer's subsection. A value of zero represents the beginning of the buffer.

## Remarks
The <b>WDFMEMORY_OFFSET</b> structure is used as a member of the <a href="..\wdfmemory\ns-wdfmemory-_wdf_memory_descriptor.md">WDF_MEMORY_DESCRIPTOR</a> structure and as an input parameter to various I/O target object methods.

## Requirements
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| ---- |:---- |
| **Minimum KMDF version** | 1.0 |
| **Minimum UMDF version** | 2.0 |
| **Header** | wdfmemory.h (include Wdf.h) |
