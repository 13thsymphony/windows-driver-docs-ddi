# WdfMemoryCopyFromBuffer function



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]

The <b>WdfMemoryCopyFromBuffer</b> method copies the contents of a specified source buffer into a specified memory object's buffer.



## -syntax

````
NTSTATUS WdfMemoryCopyFromBuffer(
  _In_ WDFMEMORY DestinationMemory,
  _In_ size_t    DestinationOffset,
  _In_ PVOID     Buffer,
  _In_ size_t    NumBytesToCopyFrom
);
````


## -parameters

### -param DestinationMemory [in]

A handle to a framework memory object that represents the destination buffer.


### -param DestinationOffset [in]

An offset, in bytes, from the beginning of the destination buffer. The copy operation begins at the specified offset in the destination buffer.


### -param Buffer [in]

A pointer to a source buffer.


### -param NumBytesToCopyFrom [in]

The number of bytes to copy from the source buffer to the destination buffer. This value must not be greater than the size of the source buffer.


## -returns
<b>WdfMemoryCopyFromBuffer</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this method might return one of the following values:
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</b></dt>
</dl>An invalid parameter was detected.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_BUFFER_SIZE</b></dt>
</dl>The byte offset that the <i>DestinationOffset</i> parameter specified was too large.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL</b></dt>
</dl>The size of the destination buffer that the <i>DestinationOffset</i> parameter specified, starting at the destination offset, was greater than the <i>NumBytesToCopyFrom</i> parameter.

 

This method also might return other <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557697">NTSTATUS values</a>.

A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.




## -remarks
The framework verifies that the destination buffer is large enough to receive the amount of data that the <i>NumBytesToCopyFrom</i> parameter specifies.

For more information about framework memory objects, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f5699837-f1ba-4088-82b3-d7e27341fb46">Using Memory Buffers</a>.

If the source or destination buffer was allocated from the pageable memory pool, the <b>WdfMemoryCopyFromBuffer</b> method must be called at IRQL &lt;= APC_LEVEL. Otherwise, the method can be called at any IRQL.

The following code example obtains a handle to the framework memory object that represents an I/O request's output buffer, and then it copies the contents of another buffer into the I/O request's output buffer.
