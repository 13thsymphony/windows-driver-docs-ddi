# PFN_WDFMEMORYASSIGNBUFFER function



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]

The <b>WdfMemoryAssignBuffer</b> method assigns a specified buffer to a memory object that a driver created by calling <a href="..\wdfmemory\nf-wdfmemory-wdfmemorycreatepreallocated.md">WdfMemoryCreatePreallocated</a>.



## -syntax

````
NTSTATUS WdfMemoryAssignBuffer(
  _In_ WDFMEMORY Memory,
  _In_ PVOID     Buffer,
  _In_ size_t    BufferSize
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Memory [in]

A handle to a framework memory object that was obtained by calling <a href="..\wdfmemory\nf-wdfmemory-wdfmemorycreatepreallocated.md">WdfMemoryCreatePreallocated</a>.


### -param Buffer [in]

A pointer to a driver-supplied buffer.


### -param BufferSize [in]

The nonzero size, in bytes, of the buffer that <i>Buffer</i> points to.


## -returns
<b>WdfMemoryAssignBuffer</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this method might return one of the following values:
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</b></dt>
</dl>An invalid parameter was detected.

 

This method also might return other <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557697">NTSTATUS values</a>.

A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.




## -remarks
The method can assign a buffer to a memory object that <a href="..\wdfmemory\nf-wdfmemory-wdfmemorycreatepreallocated.md">WdfMemoryCreatePreallocated</a> created, but not to a memory object that <a href="..\wdfmemory\nf-wdfmemory-wdfmemorycreate.md">WdfMemoryCreate</a> created.

The buffer that the <i>Buffer</i> parameter points to can be allocated from the pageable or non-pageable memory pool. If the driver allocates the buffer from the pageable pool, or if the buffer is from pageable pool because it came from a user-mode application, the driver must access the buffer only at IRQL &lt; DISPATCH_LEVEL. (Note that the driver's <a href="..\wdfobject\nc-wdfobject-evt_wdf_object_context_cleanup.md">EvtCleanupCallback</a> and <a href="..\wdfobject\nc-wdfobject-evt_wdf_object_context_destroy.md">EvtDestroyCallback</a> callback functions, if provided, can be called at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL.)

For more information about framework memory objects, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f5699837-f1ba-4088-82b3-d7e27341fb46">Using Memory Buffers</a>.

The following code example allocates a buffer and then assigns the buffer to a framework memory object.
