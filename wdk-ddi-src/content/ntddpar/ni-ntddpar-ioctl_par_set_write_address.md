# IOCTL_PAR_SET_WRITE_ADDRESS IOCTL
The IOCTL_PAR_SET_WRITE_ADDRESS request sets an extended capabilities port (ECP) or enhanced parallel port (EPP) write address (channel) for a parallel device. The parallel port bus driver queues this request on a work queue for the parallel device.

### Major Code
[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](xref:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control")

### Input Buffer
The <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member points to a UCHAR buffer that the client allocates to input a write address. The client sets the buffer to an ECP or EPP write address.

### Input Buffer Length
<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> member is set to the size, in bytes, of a UCHAR.

### Output Buffer
None.

### Output Buffer Length
None.

### Input / Output Buffer
<text></text>

### Input / Output Buffer Length
