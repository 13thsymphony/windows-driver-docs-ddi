# IOCTL_PAR_QUERY_DEVICE_ID IOCTL



## -description

The IOCTL_PAR_QUERY_DEVICE_ID request returns the IEEE 1284 device ID of a parallel device assigned by the system-supplied function driver for parallel ports.



The IOCTL_PAR_QUERY_DEVICE_ID request returns the IEEE 1284 device ID of a parallel device assigned by the system-supplied function driver for parallel ports.



## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
None.


### -input-buffer-length
None.


### -output-buffer
The <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member points to a buffer that the client allocates to output the device ID. The buffer contains the device ID and a <b>NULL</b> terminator.


### -output-buffer-length
The <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.OutputBufferLength</b> member specifies  the size, in bytes, of the output buffer that can hold both the device ID and a <b>NULL</b> terminator. A client can use an <a href="..\ntddpar\ni-ntddpar-ioctl_par_query_device_id_size.md">IOCTL_PAR_QUERY_DEVICE_ID_SIZE</a> request to determine the required buffer size. A device ID can be up to 64 KB in size.


### -in-out-buffer

<text></text>

### -inout-buffer-length

<text></text>

### -status-block
I/O Status block
If the request is successful, the <b>Information</b> member is set to the size, in bytes, of a buffer that holds both the device ID and a <b>NULL</b> terminator. Otherwise, the <b>Information</b> member is set to zero. 

The <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the generic status values returned by device control requests for parallel devices or to one of the following values:



The output buffer that <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> points to is less than the size, in bytes, of the device ID and a <b>NULL</b> terminator.

A device I/O error occurred.
