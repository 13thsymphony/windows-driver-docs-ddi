# IOCTL_IEEE1284_GET_MODE IOCTL



## -description

The IOCTL_IEEE1284_GET_MODE request returns the IEEE 1284 read and write protocols that are currently set for a parallel device. This request does not require that the parallel port, to which the parallel device is attached, be locked.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2ff53ed0-dbb7-4c8f-b6e4-5f7d20124a7c">Setting and Clearing a Communication Mode for a Parallel Device</a>.

## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
None.


### -input-buffer-length
None.


### -output-buffer
The <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member points to a PARCLASS_NEGOTIATION_MASK structure that the client allocates to output mode information. The system-supplied bus driver for parallel ports specifies the read (reverse) protocol in the <b>usReadMask</b> member and the write (forward) protocol in the <b>usWriteMask </b>member.


### -output-buffer-length
The <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.OutputBufferLength</b> member is set to the size, in bytes, of a <a href="..\ntddpar\ns-ntddpar-_parclass_negotiation_mask.md">PARCLASS_NEGOTIATION_MASK</a> structure. 


### -in-out-buffer

<text></text>

### -inout-buffer-length

<text></text>

### -status-block
I/O Status block
If the request is successful, the <b>Information</b> member is set to the size, in bytes, of a PARCLASS_NEGOTIATION_MASK. Otherwise, the <b>Information</b> member is set to zero. 

The <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the generic status values returned by device control requests for parallel devices or to the following value:



The value of <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.OutputBufferLength</b> is less than the size, in bytes, of a PARCLASS_NEGOTIATION_MASK structure.
