## -remarks
Each 
    <a href="..\sdpnode\ns-sdpnode-_sdp_node.md">SDP_NODE</a> structure in the tree representation of an
    SDP record contains a SDP_NODE_HEADER structure and an SDP_NODE_DATA union.

The header specifies the type of data. Driver developers can access links to peer 
    <b>SDP_NODE</b> structures by calling the 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554296">LIST_ENTRY</a> structure of the header. By evaluating 
    <code>Node.hdr.Link.Flink</code>and 
    <code>Node.hdr.Link.Blink</code>, drivers can obtain the addresses of peer
    nodes in the tree. Keep in mind that 
    <b>LIST_ENTRY</b> pointers contain the addresses of other LIST_ENTRY structures, and that the profile
    driver must use the 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff542043">CONTAINING_RECORD</a> memory manager macro to
    extract the address of the containing node record.
