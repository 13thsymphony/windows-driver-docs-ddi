# USBD_CalculateUsbBandwidth function
The <b>USBD_CalculateUsbBandwidth</b> routine has been deprecated in Windows XP and later operating systems. Do not use.

## Syntax

````
ULONG USBD_CalculateUsbBandwidth(
  _In_ ULONG   MaxPacketSize,
  _In_ UCHAR   EndpointType,
  _In_ BOOLEAN LowSpeed
);
````

## Parameters

`MaxPacketSize`

Specifies the maximum packet size.

`EndpointType`

Contains a value of type <a href="..\usb\ne-usb-_usbd_pipe_type.md">USBD_PIPE_TYPE</a> that specifies the pipe type.

`LowSpeed`

Indicates, when <b>TRUE</b>, that the device is a low speed device. When <b>FALSE</b>, this member indicates that the device is a hi-speed device.


## Return Value

The <b>USBD_CalculateUsbBandwidth</b> routine returns zero for bulk and control endpoints and the bandwidth consumed in bits per millisecond. returns for all other endpoints.

## Remarks

The <b>USBD_CalculateUsbBandwidth</b> routine approximates the bandwidth using the following procedure. First, <b>USBD_CalculateUsbBandwidth</b> adds the largest possible packet size, specified in <i>MaxPacketSize</i>, to the overhead associated with the type of end point specified in <i>EndpointType</i>. Next, <b>USBD_CalculateUsbBandwidth</b> multiplies this sum by 8 to convert the units from <i>bytes</i> per millisecond into <i>bits</i> per millisecond. Finally, <b>USBD_CalculateUsbBandwidth</b> multiplies this quantity by 7/6 to account for filler bits. In a worst case scenario, there will be one bit of filler data stuffed into the data stream for every six bits of data. <b>USBD_CalculateUsbBandwidth</b> uses worst-case assumptions to calculate the bandwidth required by the pipe.
