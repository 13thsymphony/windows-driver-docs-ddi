# _COMPOSITE_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES structure
The <b>COMPOSITE_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES</b> structure specifies the capabilities of the  driver of a USB multi-function device (composite driver). To initialize the structure, use the <a href="..\usbdlib\nf-usbdlib-composite_device_capabilities_init.md">COMPOSITE_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES_INIT</a> macro.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _COMPOSITE_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES {
  ULONG  CapabilityFunctionSuspend  :1;
  ULONG  Reserved  :31;
} COMPOSITE_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES, *PCOMPOSITE_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES;
````

## Members


`CapabilityFunctionSuspend`

If set to 1, indicates that the composite driver supports the USB function suspend feature.

`Reserved`

Reserved.
