# UsbBuildInterruptOrBulkTransferRequest function
The <b>UsbBuildInterruptOrBulkTransferRequest</b> macro formats an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff538923">URB</a> to send or receive data on a bulk pipe, or to receive data from an interrupt pipe.

## Syntax

```
void UsbBuildInterruptOrBulkTransferRequest(
   urb,
   length,
   pipeHandle,
   transferBuffer,
   transferBufferMDL,
   transferBufferLength,
   transferFlags,
   link
);
```

## Parameters

`urb`

Pointer to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff538923">URB</a> to be formatted as an interrupt or bulk transfer request.

`length`

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff538923">URB</a>.

`pipeHandle`

Specifies the handle for this pipe returned by the HCD when a configuration was selected.

`transferBuffer`

Pointer to a resident buffer for the transfer or is <b>NULL</b> if an MDL is supplied in <i>TransferBufferMDL</i>. The contents of this buffer depend on the value of <i>TransferFlags</i>. If USBD_TRANSFER_DIRECTION_IN is specified, this buffer will contain data read from the device on return from the HCD. Otherwise, this buffer contains driver-supplied data to be transferred to the device.

`transferBufferMDL`

Pointer to an MDL that describes a resident buffer or is <b>NULL</b> if a buffer is supplied in <i>TransferBuffer</i>. The contents of the buffer depend on the value of <i>TransferFlags</i>. If USBD_TRANSFER_DIRECTION_IN is specified, the described buffer will contain data read from the device on return from the HCD. Otherwise, the buffer contains driver-supplied data to be transferred to the device. The MDL must be allocated from nonpaged pool.

`transferBufferLength`

Specifies the length, in bytes, of the buffer specified in <i>TransferBuffer</i> or described in <i>TransferBufferMDL</i>.

`transferFlags`

Specifies zero, one, or a combination of the following flags:





#### USBD_TRANSFER_DIRECTION_IN

Is set to request data from a device. To transfer data to a device, this flag must be clear.



#### USBD_SHORT_TRANSFER_OK

Can be used if USBD_TRANSFER_DIRECTION_IN is set. If set, directs the HCD not to return an error if a packet is received from the device that is shorter than the maximum packet size for the endpoint. Otherwise, a short request returns an error condition.

`link`

Reserved. Must be set to <b>NULL</b>.


## Return Value

None
