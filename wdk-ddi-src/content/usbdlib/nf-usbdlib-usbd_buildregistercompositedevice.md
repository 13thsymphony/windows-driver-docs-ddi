# USBD_BuildRegisterCompositeDevice function
The <b>USBD_BuildRegisterCompositeDevice</b> routine is called by the driver of a USB  multi-function device (composite driver) to  initialize a <a href="..\usbdlib\ns-usbdlib-_register_composite_device.md">REGISTER_COMPOSITE_DEVICE</a> structure with the information required for registering the driver with the USB driver stack. 

The routine is called by a driver that replaces the Microsoft-provided composite driver, Usbccgp.sys.

## Syntax

````
void  USBD_BuildRegisterCompositeDevice(
  _In_  USBD_HANDLE                             USBDHandle,
  _In_  COMPOSITE_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES           CapabilityFlags,
  _In_  ULONG                                   FunctionCount,
  _Out_ bcount(Size) PREGISTER_COMPOSITE_DEVICE RegisterCompositeDevice
);
````

## Parameters

`USBDHandle`

A USBD handle that is retrieved in a previous call to the <a href="..\usbdlib\nf-usbdlib-usbd_createhandle.md">USBD_CreateHandle</a> routine.

`CapabilityFlags`

A caller-allocated <a href="..\usbdlib\ns-usbdlib-_composite_device_capabilities.md">COMPOSITE_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES</a> structure that indicates the capabilities that are supported by the composite driver. For instance, to   indicate that the composite driver supports function suspend, set the <b>CapabilityFunctionSuspend</b> member of <b>COMPOSITE_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES</b> to 1.

`FunctionCount`

The number of physical device objects (PDOs) to be created by the parent driver. The <i>FunctionCount</i> value cannot exceed 255.

`RegisterCompositeDevice`

A pointer to a caller-allocated <a href="..\usbdlib\ns-usbdlib-_register_composite_device.md">REGISTER_COMPOSITE_DEVICE</a> structure. Upon completion, the structure is populated with the specified registration  information. To register the composite driver, send the <a href="..\usbioctl\ni-usbioctl-ioctl_internal_usb_register_composite_device.md">IOCTL_INTERNAL_USB_REGISTER_COMPOSITE_DEVICE</a> I/O request and pass the populated structure.


## Return Value

This routine does not return a value.
