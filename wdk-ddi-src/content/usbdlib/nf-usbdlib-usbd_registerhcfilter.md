# USBD_RegisterHcFilter function
The <b>USBD_RegisterHcFilter</b> routine has been deprecated in Windows XP and later operating systems. Do not use. 

On  Windows XP and later operating systems, a filter driver that is installed between the root hub FDO and PDO sees all USB traffic for a USB device after it has been enumerated.  There is no supported mechanism for filtering descriptor requests that occur during the enumeration of a USB device, because those requests originate and remain in the port driver (usbport.sys) and not the hub driver.

## Syntax

````
VOID USBD_RegisterHcFilter(
  _In_ PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject,
  _In_ PDEVICE_OBJECT FilterDeviceObject
);
````

## Parameters

`DeviceObject`

Pointer to the device object that is the current top of the stack as reported by <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-ioattachdevicetodevicestack.md">IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStack</a>.

`FilterDeviceObject`

Pointer to the filter device object created by the filter driver for its operations.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

USB bus filter drivers must call this routine after attaching their device object to the device object stack for the host controller driver.
