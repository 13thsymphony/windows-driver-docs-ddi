# USBD_IsochUrbAllocate function
The  <b>USBD_IsochUrbAllocate</b> routine allocates and formats a <a href="..\usb\ns-usb-_urb.md">URB</a> structure for an isochronous transfer request.



<b>Note for Windows Driver Framework (WDF) Drivers:  </b>If your client driver is a WDF-based driver, then you must call the <a href="..\wdfusb\nf-wdfusb-wdfusbtargetdevicecreateisochurb.md">WdfUsbTargetDeviceCreateIsochUrb</a> method instead of <b>USBD_IsochUrbAllocate</b> to allocate memory for the <a href="..\usb\ns-usb-_urb.md">URB</a> structure.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS USBD_IsochUrbAllocate(
  _In_  USBD_HANDLE   USBDHandle,
  _In_  ULONG         NumberOfIsochPacket,
  _Out_ PURB        *Urb
);
````

## Parameters

`USBDHandle`

USBD handle that is retrieved by the client driver in a previous call to  the <a href="..\usbdlib\nf-usbdlib-usbd_createhandle.md">USBD_CreateHandle</a> routine.

`NumberOfIsochPacket`

Specifies the maximum number of isochronous packets required to perform the transfer. The transfer buffer is described in a variable-length array of <a href="..\usb\ns-usb-_usbd_iso_packet_descriptor.md">USBD_ISO_PACKET_DESCRIPTOR</a> structures that stores information about each packet, such as byte offset of the packet within the buffer. The array is specified in the <b>IsoPacket</b> member of the <a href="..\usb\ns-usb-_urb_isoch_transfer.md">_URB_ISOCH_TRANSFER</a> structure, which is used to define the format of an isochronous request URB.

`Urb`

Pointer to an <a href="..\usb\ns-usb-_urb.md">URB</a> structure,  which receives the URB allocated by <b>USBD_IsochUrbAllocate</b>. All members of the URB structure are set to zero. The allocated URB is large enough to hold the  maximum number of isochronous packets indicated by <b>NumberOfIsochPacket</b>. 

The client driver must free the URB when the driver has finished using it by calling <a href="..\usbdlib\nf-usbdlib-usbd_urbfree.md">USBD_UrbFree</a>.


## Return Value

The <b>USBD_IsochUrbAllocate</b> routine returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the request is successful. Otherwise,  <a href="..\usbdlib\nf-usbdlib-usbd_urballocate.md">USBD_UrbAllocate</a> sets <i>Urb</i> to NULL and returns an NT status failure code. 

Possible values include, but are not limited to, STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER, which  indicates the caller passed in NULL to <i>USBDHandle</i> or <i>Urb</i>.
