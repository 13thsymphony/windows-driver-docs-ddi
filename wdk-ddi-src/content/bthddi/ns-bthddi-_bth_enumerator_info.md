# _BTH_ENUMERATOR_INFO structure



## -description

  that caused the Plug and Play (PnP) manager to load the profile driver.

## -struct-fields

### -field EnumeratorType

Reserved for use by the Bluetooth driver stack. Do not use.


### -field Action

Reserved for use by the Bluetooth driver stack. Do not use.


### -field Port

If the enumeration was caused by a connection request, this member contains the device's port
     number. Otherwise, this value is undefined. For a L2CAP connection request, the port number also
     identifies the Protocol/Service Multiplexer (PSM) that is being connected to. For an RFCOMM connection
     request, this is an RFCOMM data link connection identifier (DLCI).


### -field Flags

A flag that indicates the direction of the request. Possible values include:

<ul>
<li>BTH_ENUMERATORFL_INCOMING</li>
<li>BTH_ENUMERATORFL_OUTGOING</li>
<li>BTH_ENUMERATORFL_REENUM</li>
</ul>

### -field Guid


      The enumeration protocol or service class GUID. This value is usually obtained from the INF file
      that loaded the profile driver.
     


### -field InstanceId


      The instance ID of the protocol or service if the BTH_ENUMERATORFL_INCOMING flag is set.
     


### -field InstanceIdStr


      The instance ID of the protocol or service if the BTH_ENUMERATORFL_OUTGOING flag is set.
     


### -field Vid

The vendor ID of the remote device, which is obtained from SDP.


### -field Pid

The product ID of the remote device, which is obtained from SDP.


### -field Mfg

The manufacturer ID of the remote device, which is obtained from SDP.


### -field LocalMfg

The local radio manufacturer obtained from the HCI.


### -field VidType


      The remote device vendor ID type, which is obtained from SDP.
     


### -field ServiceName

The service name that is used for local services.


### -field SdpPriLangServiceName

The identifier used for remote services.


### -field DeviceString

The device string for the remote device.
