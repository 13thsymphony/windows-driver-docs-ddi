# _BRB_SCO_FLUSH_CHANNEL structure
The _BRB_SCO_FLUSH_CHANNEL structure describes a flush operation for a SCO channel.

## Syntax
````
struct _BRB_SCO_FLUSH_CHANNEL {
  BRB_HEADER         Hdr;
  BTH_ADDR           BtAddress;
  SCO_CHANNEL_HANDLE ChannelHandle;
  ULONG              FlushFlags;
};
````

## Members


`Hdr`

A 
     <a href="..\bthddi\ns-bthddi-_brb_header.md">BRB_HEADER</a> structure that contains information
     about the current BRB.

`BtAddress`

The Bluetooth address of the remote device.

`ChannelHandle`

The handle to the SCO channel to flush.

`FlushFlags`

#####  Valid flags may be combined using a logical OR
     operation:



#### SCO_FLUSH_DIRECTION_OUT



#### SCO_FLUSH_DIRECTION_IN



####

## Remarks
To flush a SCO channel, profile drivers should 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/53a692e7-9c71-4dca-9331-32ac97b94179">build and send</a> a 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536623">BRB_SCO_FLUSH_CHANNEL</a> request.

All pending data transfer IRPs will be completed with STATUS_REQUEST_ABORTED. In-progress IRPs will be
    completed normally, with success or failure, depending on whether the Bluetooth driver stack was able to
    transfer data to or from the remote device.
