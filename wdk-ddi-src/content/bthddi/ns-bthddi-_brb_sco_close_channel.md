# _BRB_SCO_CLOSE_CHANNEL structure
The _BRB_SCO_CLOSE_CHANNEL structure describes a currently open SCO channel to close.

## Syntax
````
struct _BRB_SCO_CLOSE_CHANNEL {
  BRB_HEADER         Hdr;
  BTH_ADDR           BtAddress;
  SCO_CHANNEL_HANDLE ChannelHandle;
};
````

## Members


`BtAddress`

The Bluetooth address of the remote device.

`ChannelHandle`

The handle to the SCO channel to close.

`Hdr`

A 
     <a href="..\bthddi\ns-bthddi-_brb_header.md">BRB_HEADER</a> structure that contains information
     about the current BRB.

## Remarks
To close a SCO channel, profile drivers should 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/53a692e7-9c71-4dca-9331-32ac97b94179">build and send</a> a 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536622">BRB_SCO_CLOSE_CHANNEL</a> request.

A <b>BRB_SCO_CLOSE_CHANNEL</b> request can be made for a channel that was initiated locally or remotely. If a
    profile driver has multiple SCO connections to a single remote device, it must close each one
    individually.
