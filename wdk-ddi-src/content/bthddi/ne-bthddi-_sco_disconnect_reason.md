# _SCO_DISCONNECT_REASON Enumeration
The SCO_DISCONNECT_REASON enumeration type gives the reason an SCO channel has been
  disconnected.

## Syntax
````
typedef enum _SCO_DISCONNECT_REASON { 
  ScoHciDisconnect      = 0,
  ScoDisconnectRequest  = 1,
  ScoRadioPoweredDown   = 2,
  ScoHardwareRemoval    = 3
} SCO_DISCONNECT_REASON, *PSCO_DISCONNECT_REASON;
````

## Constants

<table>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>ScoDisconnectRequest</td>
                    <td>This value specifies to the profile driver that a disconnect request has been received from the
     remote device.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>ScoHardwareRemoval</td>
                    <td>This value specifies to the profile driver that the local radio has been physically
     removed.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>ScoHciDisconnect</td>
                    <td>This value specifies to the profile driver that the Bluetooth driver stack has received a
     disconnect notification from the host controller interface (HCI) layer.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>ScoRadioPoweredDown</td>
                    <td>This value specifies to the profile driver that the local radio has been turned off.</td>
                </tr>
</table>

    ## Remarks

        A value from this enumeration is used as the 
    <b>Reason</b> member of the 
    <a href="..\bthddi\ns-bthddi-_sco_indication_parameters.md">
    SCO_INDICATION_PARAMETERS</a> structure.

Hardware limitations may prevent the Bluetooth driver stack from distinguishing between 
    <b>ScoRadioPoweredDown</b> and 
    <b>ScoHardwareRemoval</b> events.

Currently, 
    <i>ScoHciDisconnect</i> is the only value the Bluetooth driver stack passes to the 
    <a href="..\bthddi\nc-bthddi-pfnsco_indication_callback.md">SCO Callback Function</a>.

## Requirements
