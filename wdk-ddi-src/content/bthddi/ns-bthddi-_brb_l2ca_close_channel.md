# _BRB_L2CA_CLOSE_CHANNEL structure
The _BRB_L2CA_CLOSE_CHANNEL structure describes an open L2CAP channel to close.

## Syntax
````
struct _BRB_L2CA_CLOSE_CHANNEL {
  BRB_HEADER           Hdr;
  BTH_ADDR             BtAddress;
  L2CAP_CHANNEL_HANDLE ChannelHandle;
};
````

## Members


`BtAddress`

The address of the remote device.

`ChannelHandle`

The L2CAP channel handle that was returned by Bluetooth driver stack in response to an earlier 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536615">BRB_L2CA_OPEN_CHANNEL</a> or 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff536616">
     BRB_L2CA_OPEN_CHANNEL_RESPONSE</a> request. This is the channel handle to close.

`Hdr`

A 
     <a href="..\bthddi\ns-bthddi-_brb_header.md">BRB_HEADER</a> structure that contains information
     about the current BRB.

## Remarks
To close a L2CAP channel, profile drivers should 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/53a692e7-9c71-4dca-9331-32ac97b94179">build and send</a> a 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536614">BRB_L2CA_CLOSE_CHANNEL</a> request.

A <b>BRB_L2CA_CLOSE_CHANNEL</b> request can be made for a channel that was initiated locally or remotely. If
    a profile driver has multiple L2CAP channels to a single remote device, it must close each one
    individually.
