# _BRB_L2CA_REGISTER_SERVER structure
A profile driver uses the _BRB_L2CA_REGISTER_SERVER structure to register itself as a server capable
  of receiving L2CAP connections from remote Bluetooth devices.

## Syntax
````
struct _BRB_L2CA_REGISTER_SERVER {
  BRB_HEADER                     Hdr;
  BTH_ADDR                       BtAddress;
  USHORT                         PSM;
  ULONG                          IndicationFlags;
  PFNBTHPORT_INDICATION_CALLBACK IndicationCallback;
  PVOID                          IndicationCallbackContext;
  PVOID                          ReferenceObject;
  L2CAP_SERVER_HANDLE            ServerHandle;
};
````

## Members


`BtAddress`

The address of the remote Bluetooth device to receive notifications for. Specify BTH_ADDR_NULL to
     receive notification for any incoming connections.

`Hdr`

A 
     <a href="..\bthddi\ns-bthddi-_brb_header.md">BRB_HEADER</a> structure that contains information
     about the current BRB.

`IndicationCallback`

A 
     <a href="..\bthddi\nc-bthddi-pfnbthport_indication_callback.md">L2CAP Callback Function</a>,
     implemented by the profile driver, that the Bluetooth driver stack should call to notify the profile
     driver about incoming L2CAP connections.

`IndicationCallbackContext`

The context to be passed to the callback function that is specified in the 
     <b>IndicationCallback</b> member.

`IndicationFlags`

An optional flag or combination of flags that indicates whether the profile driver will accept
     pairing notifications in addition to connection notifications. The following table lists the possible
     flag settings. 
     

<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
INDICATION_PAIR_DEVICE

</td>
<td>
The profile driver will accept notifications when a device is paired.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
INDICATION_UNPAIR_DEVICE

</td>
<td>
The profile driver will accept notifications when a device is unpaired.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
INDICATION_UNPERSONALIZE_DEVICE

</td>
<td>
The profile driver will accept notifications when a device is unpersonalized.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`PSM`

The Protocol/Service Multiplexer (PSM) that accepts connection requests.

`ReferenceObject`

A pointer to an object to pass to the 
     <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-obreferenceobject.md">ObReferenceObject</a> and 
     <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-obdereferenceobject.md">ObDereferenceObject</a> functions to
     maintain a reference count. Profile drivers should provide this object in such a way that the Bluetooth
     driver stack can increase the count of the object for as long as the driver stack can call the callback
     function specified in the 
     <b>IndicationCallback</b> member. The Bluetooth driver stack will decrease the reference count of the
     object when the profile driver 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/53a692e7-9c71-4dca-9331-32ac97b94179">builds and sends</a> a 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff536862">
     BRB_L2CA_UNREGISTER_SERVER</a> request.

`ServerHandle`

Handle to the L2CAP server, if successfully returned. When the profile driver should no longer
     receive remote connect indications it should pass this handle to 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff536862">
     BRB_L2CA_UNREGISTER_SERVER</a>.

## Remarks
To register itself as a L2CAP server, a profile driver should 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/53a692e7-9c71-4dca-9331-32ac97b94179">build and send</a> a 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff536618">
    BRB_L2CA_REGISTER_SERVER</a> request.

After the profile driver registers itself, it should then 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/53a692e7-9c71-4dca-9331-32ac97b94179">build and send</a> a 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536621">BRB_REGISTER_PSM</a> request so the Bluetooth
    driver stack will accept connections from the PSM.

If successful, the Bluetooth driver stack can then notify the profile driver when remote devices
    attempt to create a L2CAP connection to the profile driver on a particular PSM.

A profile driver can specify zero the 
    <b>Psm</b> member of the _BRB_L2CA_REGISTER_SERVER structure--which means that the PSM is unspecified--and
    the profile driver will subsequently issue a <b>BRB_REGISTER_PSM</b> BRB to obtain a dynamic PSM to register for
    connection notifications. For more information about PSMs, see 
    <a href="..\bthddi\ns-bthddi-_brb_psm.md">_BRB_PSM</a>.

After the profile driver has registered itself, the Bluetooth driver stack can notify it when a remote
    device attempts to connect to it by calling the 
    <a href="..\bthddi\nc-bthddi-pfnbthport_indication_callback.md">L2CAP Callback Function</a> that the
    profile driver implements and specifies in the 
    <b>IndicationCallback</b> member.

For more information about L2CAP servers and PSMs, see 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/26a8238d-717a-438f-84d0-047ce9618928">Accepting
    L2CAP Connections in a Bluetooth Profile Driver</a>.

When the profile driver receives notification of a connection attempt, it should 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/53a692e7-9c71-4dca-9331-32ac97b94179">build and send</a> a 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff536616">
    BRB_L2CA_OPEN_CHANNEL_RESPONSE</a> BRB to either accept or reject the connection attempt. For more
    information about accepting or rejecting L2CAP connection attempts, see the 
    <a href="..\bthddi\ns-bthddi-_brb_l2ca_open_channel.md">_BRB_L2CA_OPEN_CHANNEL</a> structure.

After a connection is established, the profile driver can issue other BRBs to communicate with the
    remote device.

To stop receiving remote connection notifications, a profile driver should 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/53a692e7-9c71-4dca-9331-32ac97b94179">build and send</a> a 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff536862">
    BRB_L2CA_UNREGISTER_SERVER</a> request.

While this procedure allows a profile driver to accept incoming connection requests, it does not
    automatically advertise a service using SDP. To advertise a service using SDP, a profile driver must
    submit an SDP record using the SDP APIs. For more information about advertising services with SDP, see 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/833f2eea-d7e6-4f19-979e-3bb4db47fa43">Communicating with SDP
    Servers</a>.
