# _INDICATION_CODE Enumeration
The INDICATION_CODE enumeration type indicates to a profile driver what type of L2CAP event has
  occurred.

## Syntax
````
typedef enum _INDICATION_CODE { 
  IndicationAddReference          = 0,
  IndicationReleaseReference,
  IndicationRemoteConnect,
  IndicationRemoteDisconnect,
  IndicationRemoteConfigRequest   = 4,
  IndicationRemoteConfigResponse,
  IndicationFreeExtraOptions      = 6,
  IndicationRecvPacket,
  IndicationPairDevice,
  IndicationUnpairDevice          = 9,
  IndicationUnpersonalizeDevice,
  IndicationRemoteConnectLE
} INDICATION_CODE, *PINDICATION_CODE;
````

## Constants

<table>

<tr>
<td>IndicationAddReference</td>
<td>Indicates to a profile driver to add a reference to its device object because it may be called at
     any time.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>IndicationFreeExtraOptions</td>
<td>Reserved for future use. Do not use.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>IndicationPairDevice</td>
<td>Indicates to a registered driver that the local radio has bonded to a specific remote
     radio.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>IndicationRecvPacket</td>
<td>Indicates to a registered profile driver that a packet has been received on the specified PSM. The
     profile driver can use this event to determine when it is necessary to issue a read
     BRB_L2CA_ACL_TRANSFTER BRB. Profile drivers that need to read from the remote device can also ignore
     this notification and keep a read BRB pending at all times. When this indication code is passed, the
     profile driver should use the parameters that are passed to it in the 
     <b>RecvPacket</b> member of the 
     <mshelp:link keywords="bltooth.indication_parameters" tabindex="0"><b>
     INDICATION_PARAMETERS</b></mshelp:link> structure.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>IndicationReleaseReference</td>
<td>Indicates to a profile driver to release a reference to its device object and that it will no
     longer be called.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>IndicationRemoteConfigRequest</td>
<td>Indicates to a client profile driver that a remote device is performing a configuration request.
     When this indication code is passed, the profile driver should use the parameters that are passed to it
     in the 
     <b>ConfigRequest</b> member of the INDICATION_PARAMETERS structure.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>IndicationRemoteConfigResponse</td>
<td>Indicates to a client profile driver that a remote device is responding to a configuration
     request. When this indication code is passed, the profile driver should use the parameters that are
     passed to it in the 
     <b>ConfigResponse</b> member of the INDICATION_PARAMETERS structure.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>IndicationRemoteConnect</td>
<td>Indicates to a server profile driver that a remote device is connecting to the PSM that the
     profile driver registered earlier. Profile drivers accept or reject this request by 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/53a692e7-9c71-4dca-9331-32ac97b94179">building and sending</a> a 
     <mshelp:link keywords="bltooth.brb_l2ca_open_channel_response" tabindex="0"><b>
     BRB_L2CA_OPEN_CHANNEL_RESPONSE</b></mshelp:link> request. When this indication code is passed, the profile driver
     should use the parameters that are passed to it in the 
     <b>Connect</b> member of the 
     <mshelp:link keywords="bltooth.indication_parameters" tabindex="0"><b>
     INDICATION_PARAMETERS</b></mshelp:link> structure.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>IndicationRemoteConnectLE</td>
<td>Indicates to a server profile driver that a low energy (LE) remote device is connecting to the PSM that the
     profile driver registered earlier. Profile drivers accept or reject this request by 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/53a692e7-9c71-4dca-9331-32ac97b94179">building and sending</a> a 
     <mshelp:link keywords="bltooth.brb_l2ca_open_channel_response" tabindex="0"><b>
     BRB_L2CA_OPEN_CHANNEL_RESPONSE</b></mshelp:link> request. When this indication code is passed, the profile driver
     should use the parameters that are passed to it in the 
     <b>Connect</b> member of the 
     <mshelp:link keywords="bltooth.indication_parameters" tabindex="0"><b>
     INDICATION_PARAMETERS</b></mshelp:link> structure. This value is present in Windows 8 and later versions of Windows.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>IndicationRemoteDisconnect</td>
<td>Indicates to a registered profile driver that a remote device disconnecting from the local radio.
     When this indication code is passed, the profile driver should use the parameters that are passed to it
     in the 
     <b>Disconnect</b> member of the INDICATION_PARAMETERS structure.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>IndicationUnpairDevice</td>
<td>Indicates to a registered driver that the local radio is no longer bonded to a specific remote
     radio.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>IndicationUnpersonalizeDevice</td>
<td>Indicates to a registered driver that the specified remote radio has been removed from the list of
     personal devices.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

A value from this enumeration is passed to a profile driver's 
    <a href="..\bthddi\nc-bthddi-pfnbthport_indication_callback.md">L2CAP Callback Function</a> to notify
    it of an event.
