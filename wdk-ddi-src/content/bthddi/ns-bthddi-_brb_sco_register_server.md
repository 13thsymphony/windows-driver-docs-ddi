# _BRB_SCO_REGISTER_SERVER structure
A profile driver uses the _BRB_SCO_REGISTER_SERVER structure to register itself as a server capable
  of receiving SCO connections from remote Bluetooth devices.

## Syntax
````
struct _BRB_SCO_REGISTER_SERVER {
  BRB_HEADER                 Hdr;
  BTH_ADDR                   BtAddress;
  ULONG                      Reserved;
  ULONG                      IndicationFlags;
  PFNSCO_INDICATION_CALLBACK IndicationCallback;
  PVOID                      IndicationCallbackContext;
  PVOID                      ReferenceObject;
  SCO_SERVER_HANDLE          ServerHandle;
};
````

## Members


`BtAddress`

The address of the remote Bluetooth device for which to receive notifications.

`Hdr`

A 
     <a href="..\bthddi\ns-bthddi-_brb_header.md">BRB_HEADER</a> structure that contains information
     about the current BRB.

`IndicationCallback`

A 
     <a href="..\bthddi\nc-bthddi-pfnsco_indication_callback.md">SCO Callback Function</a>, implemented
     by the profile driver, that the Bluetooth driver stack should call to notify the profile driver about
     incoming SCO connections.

`IndicationCallbackContext`

The context passed to the function that is defined in the 
     <b>IndicationCallback</b> member.

`IndicationFlags`

A flag that indicates when the callback function that is specified in the 
     <b>IndicationCallback</b> member should be called. The following flags are defined.
     
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<b>Flag</b>

</td>
<td>
<b>Description</b>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
SCO_INDICATION_SCO_REQUEST

</td>
<td>
Notify the profile driver if there are any incoming SCO connections.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
SCO_INDICATION_ESCO_REQUEST

</td>
<td>
Notify the profile driver if there are any incoming eSCO connections.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`ReferenceObject`

A pointer to an object to pass to the 
     <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-obreferenceobject.md">ObReferenceObject</a> and 
     <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-obdereferenceobject.md">ObDereferenceObject</a> functions to
     maintain a reference count of. Profile drivers should provide this object in such a way that the
     Bluetooth driver stack can increase the count of the object for as long as the driver stack can call the
     callback function specified in the 
     <b>IndicationCallback</b> member. The Bluetooth driver stack will decrease the reference count of the
     object when the profile driver 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/53a692e7-9c71-4dca-9331-32ac97b94179">builds and sends</a> a 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff536630">
     BRB_SCO_UNREGISTER_SERVER</a> request.

`Reserved`

Reserved for future use. Do not use.

`ServerHandle`

Handle to the SCO server, if successfully returned. When the profile driver should no longer
     receive remote connect indications it should pass this handle to 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff536630">
     BRB_SCO_UNREGISTER_SERVER</a>.

## Remarks
To register itself as a SCO server, a profile driver should 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/53a692e7-9c71-4dca-9331-32ac97b94179">build and send</a> a 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536628">BRB_SCO_REGISTER_SERVER</a> request.

If successful, the Bluetooth driver stack can then notify the profile driver when remote devices
    attempt to create a SCO connection to the profile driver.

After the profile driver has registered itself, the Bluetooth driver stack can notify it when a remote
    device attempts to connect to it by calling the 
    <a href="..\bthddi\nc-bthddi-pfnsco_indication_callback.md">SCO Callback Function</a> that the
    profile driver implements and specifies in the 
    <b>IndicationCallback</b> member.

When the profile driver receives notification of a connection attempt, it should 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/53a692e7-9c71-4dca-9331-32ac97b94179">build and send</a> a 
    <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/0a9a4323-d046-4d27-9d22-4974dbab30a4/windows-bluetooth-sco-brbscoopenchannelresponse?forum=wdk">
    BRB_SCO_OPEN_CHANNEL_RESPONSE</a> request to either accept or reject the connection attempt. For more
    information about accepting or rejecting SCO connection attempts, see the 
    <a href="..\bthddi\ns-bthddi-_brb_sco_open_channel.md">_BRB_SCO_OPEN_CHANNEL</a> structure.

After a connection is established, the profile driver can issue other BRBs to communicate with the
    remote device.

To stop receiving remote connection notifications, a profile driver should 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/53a692e7-9c71-4dca-9331-32ac97b94179">build and send</a> a 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff536630">
    BRB_SCO_UNREGISTER_SERVER</a> request.
