# _BRB_L2CA_PING structure
The _BRB_L2CA_PING structure describes a request to ping a remote radio.

## Syntax
````
struct _BRB_L2CA_PING {
  BRB_HEADER Hdr;
  BTH_ADDR   BtAddress;
  UCHAR      PingRequestLength;
  UCHAR      PingRequestData[MAX_L2CAP_PING_DATA_LENGTH];
  UCHAR      PingResponseLength;
  UCHAR      PingResponseData[MAX_L2CAP_PING_DATA_LENGTH];
};
````

## Members


`BtAddress`

The address of the device that the ping is sent to.

`Hdr`

A 
     <a href="..\bthddi\ns-bthddi-_brb_header.md">BRB_HEADER</a> structure that contains information
     about the current BRB.

`PingRequestData`

The data to send in the ping signal.

`PingRequestLength`

The length, in bytes, of the data to send in the ping signal.

`PingResponseData`

The data that the remote device responded to the ping signal with.

`PingResponseLength`

The length, in bytes, of the data that the remote device responded to the ping signal with.

## Remarks
To ping a remote radio, by transmitting a L2CA_EchoReq message and receiving a L2CAP_EchoRsp message,
    profile drivers should 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/53a692e7-9c71-4dca-9331-32ac97b94179">build and send</a> a 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536617">BRB_L2CA_PING</a> request.

BRB_L2CA_PING is primarily used for debugging.
