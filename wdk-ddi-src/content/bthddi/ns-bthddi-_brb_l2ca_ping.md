# _BRB_L2CA_PING structure
The _BRB_L2CA_PING structure describes a request to ping a remote radio.

## Syntax
```
struct _BRB_L2CA_PING {
  BRB_HEADER Hdr;
  BTH_ADDR   BtAddress;
  UCHAR      PingRequestLength;
  UCHAR      PingRequestData[MAX_L2CAP_PING_DATA_LENGTH];
  UCHAR      PingResponseLength;
  UCHAR      PingResponseData[MAX_L2CAP_PING_DATA_LENGTH];
};
```

## Members


`Hdr`

A 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536612">BRB_HEADER</a> structure that contains information
     about the current BRB.

`BtAddress`

The address of the device that the ping is sent to.

`PingRequestLength`

The length, in bytes, of the data to send in the ping signal.

`PingRequestData`

The data to send in the ping signal.

`PingResponseLength`

The length, in bytes, of the data that the remote device responded to the ping signal with.

`PingResponseData`

The data that the remote device responded to the ping signal with.

## Remarks
To ping a remote radio, by transmitting a L2CA_EchoReq message and receiving a L2CAP_EchoRsp message,
    profile drivers should
