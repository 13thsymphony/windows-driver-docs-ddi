# MappingAvailable method
The <code>MappingAvailable</code> method indicates that a new mapping is available.

## Syntax

````
VOID MappingAvailable(
    None
);
````

## Parameters

This function has no parameters.

## Return Value

None

## Remarks

The port driver calls the <code>MappingAvailable</code> method to notify the miniport driver that a new mapping has become available, but it does so only when the miniport driver's previous request for mapping through <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536909">IPortWavePciStream::GetMapping</a> has been refused.

The port driver (Portcls.sys) can call the <code>MappingAvailable</code> method at any level equal to or below DISPATCH_LEVEL, depending on the circumstances under which the call is made. As a result, the <code>MappingAvailable</code> method must be in a non-paged code segment and can only touch non-paged code.

See the discussion of allocator framing in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6d83c015-cf8f-40b4-bf28-de865a5bfe2d">WavePci Latency</a>.
