# Service method
The <code>Service</code> method notifies the miniport driver of a request for service.

## Syntax

````
void Service(
    None
);
````

## Parameters

This function has no parameters.

## Return Value

None

## Remarks

When the port driver calls the miniport driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536709">IMiniportMidi::Init</a> method, that method outputs a reference to the miniport driver's <a href="..\portcls\nn-portcls-iservicegroup.md">IServiceGroup</a> object. The port driver adds its own <a href="..\portcls\nn-portcls-iservicesink.md">IServiceSink</a> object to this service group and then waits to receive notification of a service request. The source of the notification is typically the miniport driver's interrupt service routine (ISR).

When the miniport driver's ISR calls the port driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536893">IPortMidi::Notify</a> routine, the port driver queues a deferred procedure call (DPC). When the DPC executes, it calls the <b>RequestService</b> method on each of the <b>IServiceSink</b> objects in the service group. When the DPC calls this method on the port driver's <b>IServiceSink</b> object, the port driver in turn calls the miniport driver's <code>Service</code> method.
