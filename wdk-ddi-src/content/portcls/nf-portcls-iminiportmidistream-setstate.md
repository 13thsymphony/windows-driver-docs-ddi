# IMiniportMidiStream::SetState method



## -description
The <code>SetState</code> method sets the stream's transport state to a new state value.



## -syntax

````
NTSTATUS SetState(
  [in] KSSTATE NewState
);
````


## -parameters

### -param NewState [in]

Specifies the new state that the stream is to be set to. This parameter is a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566856">KSSTATE</a> enumeration value. For more information, see the following Remarks section.


## -returns
<code>SetState</code> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call was successful. Otherwise, the method returns an appropriate error code.


## -remarks
For an audio filter graph, the four <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566856">KSSTATE</a> enumeration values are interpreted as follows:

KSSTATE_RUN 

Data transport in the current audio filter graph is running and functioning as normal.

KSSTATE_ACQUIRE 

This is a transitional state that helps to manage the transition between KSSTATE_RUN and KSSTATE_STOP.

KSSTATE_PAUSE 

This is a transitional state that helps to manage the transition between KSSTATE_RUN and KSSTATE_STOP. 

KSSTATE_STOP 

Data transport is stopped in the current audio filter graph.

For most miniport drivers, KSSTATE_ACQUIRE and KSSTATE_PAUSE are indistinguishable. The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536710">IMiniportMidi::NewStream</a> method sets the initial state of the stream to KSSTATE_STOP.

Transitions always occur in one of the following two sequences:

STOP -&gt; ACQUIRE -&gt; PAUSE -&gt; RUN

RUN -&gt; PAUSE -&gt; ACQUIRE -&gt; STOP
