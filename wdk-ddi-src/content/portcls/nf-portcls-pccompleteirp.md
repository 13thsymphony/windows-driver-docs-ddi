# PcCompleteIrp function
The <b>PcCompleteIrp</b> function completes an IRP that was previously marked as pending.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS PcCompleteIrp(
  _In_ PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject,
  _In_ PIRP           Irp,
  _In_ NTSTATUS       Status
);
````

## Parameters

`pDeviceObject`

TBD

`pIrp`

TBD

`ntStatus`

TBD


## Return Value

<b>PcCompleteIrp</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call was successful. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate error code.

## Remarks

<b>PcCompleteIrp</b> is used when an IRP handler returns STATUS_PENDING and the IRP must later be completed. When the adapter driver finishes all processing of the IRP, it calls <b>PcCompleteIrp</b> to complete the IRP.

The IRP handler should not call this function. An adapter driver's IRP handler instead calls <a href="..\portcls\nf-portcls-pcdispatchirp.md">PcDispatchIrp</a> to pass the IRP to the PortCls system driver's IRP handler to perform all remaining processing of the IRP.
