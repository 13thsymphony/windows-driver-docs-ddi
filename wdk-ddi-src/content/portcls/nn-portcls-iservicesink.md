# IServiceSink interface



## -description
The <code>IServiceSink</code> interface encapsulates handling of a service request. The source of the service request is typically the miniport driver's interrupt service routine. PortCls supports the <code>IServiceSink</code> interface. An <code>IServiceSink</code> object is typically a member of a service group that is managed by an <a href="..\portcls\nn-portcls-iservicegroup.md">IServiceGroup</a> object. <code>IServiceSink</code> inherits from the <b>IUnknown</b> interface.

<code>IServiceSink</code> is the base interface for <b>IServiceGroup</b>. This allows an <b>IServiceGroup</b> object to add itself (as an object with an <code>IServiceSink</code> interface) to another <b>IServiceGroup</b> object's service group.

Although the PortCls system driver provides a <a href="audio.pcnewservicegroup">PcNewServiceGroup</a> function for creating a service group object, no similar function exists for creating a service sink object. Instead, a driver object that requires a service sink simply implements an <code>IServiceSink</code> interface in the driver object. For convenience, header file portcls.h includes an <b>IMP_IServiceSink</b> constant for adding the <code>IServiceSink</code> implementation to the object's class definition. The cost of adding an <code>IServiceSink</code> interface to an object is small because the interface supports only a single method. A port driver typically adds an <code>IServiceSink</code> interface to its port object and stream objects so that they can receive notification of interrupts from an audio device.

## -inheritance
The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IServiceSink</b> interface inherits from the <a href="com.iunknown" xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n"><b>IUnknown</b></a> interface. <b>IServiceSink</b> also has these types of members:

The <b>IServiceSink</b> interface has these methods.

The <code>RequestService</code> method is called to forward a service request to an <b>IServiceSink</b> object.
