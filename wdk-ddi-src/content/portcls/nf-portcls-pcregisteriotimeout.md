# PcRegisterIoTimeout function
The <b>PcRegisterIoTimeout</b> function registers a driver-supplied I/O-timer callback routine for a specified device object.

Once registered, the port-class driver calls the timer callback approximately once per second for as long as the device remains active.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This function is deprecated for Windows 8 and later versions of Windows.  For Windows on Arm systems, this function is commented out in the PortCls class driver and is inaccessible.</div><div> </div>

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS PcRegisterIoTimeout(
  _In_ PDEVICE_OBJECT    pDeviceObject,
  _In_ PIO_TIMER_ROUTINE pTimerRoutine,
  _In_ PVOID             pContext
);
````

## Parameters

`pDeviceObject`

Pointer to a device object representing a device on which I/O operations can time out. This parameter must point to a system structure of type <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_device_object.md">DEVICE_OBJECT</a>. When calling the I/O-timer callback routine, the port class driver passes this pointer as the first of two call parameters. For more information, see the following Remarks section.

`pTimerRoutine`

Pointer to the driver-supplied I/O-timer callback routine. For more information, see the following Remarks section.

`pContext`

Pointer to the driver-specific context. When calling the I/O-timer callback routine, the port class driver passes this pointer as the second of two call parameters. For more information, see the following Remarks section.


## Return Value

<b>PcRegisterIoTimeout</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call was successful. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate error code. The following table shows some of the possible error codes.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Possibly indicates that a memory allocation failed inside the port-class driver.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Possibly indicates that a timer callback with the same combination of device object, I/O-timer callback routine, and context is already registered.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

An adapter driver calls the <b>PcRegisterIoTimeout</b> function to enable a low-resolution watchdog timer. Drivers use this function primarily to monitor devices that have no means to generate an event themselves if they fail to complete a previously initiated I/O operation within some maximum time interval.

After the driver calls <b>PcRegisterIoTimeout</b>, the port-class driver calls the driver's I/O-timer callback routine approximately once per second for as long as the device remains active. (The device is activated by an IRP_MN_START_DEVICE request and deactivated by an IRP_MN_STOP_DEVICE request.)

The driver can disable the timer by calling <a href="..\portcls\nf-portcls-pcunregisteriotimeout.md">PcUnregisterIoTimeout</a>.

Only one timer callback with a particular combination of device object, I/O-timer callback routine, and context can be registered at a time.

The meaning of the <i>pContext</i> parameter is determined by the adapter driver, but the driver typically sets this parameter to point to an object such as the miniport, miniport-stream, or adapter object.

The <i>pTimerRoutine </i>parameter is of type PIO_TIMER_ROUTINE, which is defined in ntddk.h to be

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>  VOID
    (*PIO_TIMER_ROUTINE)(
      IN PDEVICE_OBJECT  DeviceObject,
      IN PVOID  Context
      );</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
The <i>DeviceObject</i> and <i>Context</i> parameters are the same values that the adapter driver previously passed as call parameters to <b>PcRegisterIoTimeout</b>. The port-class driver calls the timer routine at IRQL DISPATCH_LEVEL. The timer routine must not contain pageable code.
