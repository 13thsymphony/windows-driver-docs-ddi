# IServiceGroup::RemoveMember method
The <code>RemoveMember</code> method removes the specified member from the service group.

## Syntax

```
void RemoveMember(
  PSERVICESINK pServiceSink
);
```

## Parameters

`pServiceSink`

Pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537006">IServiceSink</a> interface of the member that is to be removed


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

The <code>RemoveMember</code> method removes a service sink that was previously added to the service group by an <b>AddMember</b> call. The <b>AddMember</b> method called <b>AddRef</b> on the service sink object, and the <code>RemoveMember</code> method calls <b>Release</b> on the service sink object. This behavior is in accordance with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e6b19110-37e2-4d23-a528-6393c12ab650">reference-counting conventions for COM objects</a>.
