# D3ExitLatencyChanged method
PortCls calls the D3ExitLatencyChanged method while the device is in sleep (D3) power state, to provide a new exit latency value.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS D3ExitLatencyChanged(
  [in] PC_EXIT_LATENCY NewD3ExitLatency
);
````

## Parameters

`NewD3ExitLatency`

The  <a href="..\portcls\ne-portcls-_pc_exit_latency.md">PC_EXIT_LATENCY</a> enumerated value that Portcls has determined for the device.


## Return Value

This method returns an NTSTATUS value.

## Remarks

The D3ExitLatencyChanged method is only called when the device is the D3 power state. When Portcls wakes the device into D0, it does so via <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj200332">PowerChangeState3</a>, and the device must be able to exit its sleep state within the latency period indicated by <i>NewD3ExitLatency</i>. Waking the audio adapter in this manner allows the driver to use the most appropriate method to adjust the power state of the audio adapter within the time-frame indicated  by the <i>NewD3ExitLatency</i> value.

The following table shows the possible values for <i>NewD3ExitLatency</i>.
  <table>
<tr>
<th>Exit Latency</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PcExitLatencyInstant </td>
<td>The driver must wake the audio adapter instantly with no latency. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PcExitLatencyFast </td>
<td>The driver must wake the audio adapter  within 10 milliseconds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PcExitLatencyResponsive</td>
<td>The driver must wake the audio adapter  within 200 milliseconds.</td>
</tr>
</table>
