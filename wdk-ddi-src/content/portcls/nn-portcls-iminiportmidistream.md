# IMiniportMidiStream interface



## -description
The <code>IMiniportMidiStream</code> interface represents the MIDI stream that flows through a pin on a MIDI filter. The filter wraps a MIDI synthesizer or capture device and is implemented by pairing a MIDI port driver with a MIDI miniport driver. The miniport driver implements the <code>IMiniportMidiStream</code> interface and exposes it to the port driver. The port driver creates a stream object with this interface by calling the miniport driver's <a href="audio.iminiportmidi_newstream">IMiniportMidi::NewStream</a> method. <code>IMiniportMidiStream</code> inherits from the <b>IUnknown</b> interface.
 This interface provides methods for reading and writing a MIDI stream and for setting the format and state of a MIDI stream.


## -inheritance
The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IMiniportMidiStream</b> interface inherits from the <a href="com.iunknown" xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n"><b>IUnknown</b></a> interface but does not have additional members.
