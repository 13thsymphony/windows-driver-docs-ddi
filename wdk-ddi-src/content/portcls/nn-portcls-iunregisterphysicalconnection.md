# IUnregisterPhysicalConnection interface



## -description
The <code>IUnregisterPhysicalConnection</code> interface implements three methods to remove a registered physical connection. The port driver implements this interface. To determine whether a port driver supports the <code>IUnregisterPhysicalConnection</code> interface, a miniport driver calls the port driver object's <b>QueryInterface</b> method with REFIID <b>IID_IUnregisterPhysicalConnection</b>. The miniport driver is responsible for releasing the <code>IUnregisterPhysicalConnection</code> object after it is no longer needed. The <code>IUnregisterPhysicalConnection</code> interface inherits from <b>IUnknown</b>.

The following port drivers support the <code>IUnregisterSubdevice</code> interface:

WaveCyclic

WavePci

Topology

DMus

MIDI

The three methods in this interface "unregister" physical connections that were registered previously by calls to the <a href="..\portcls\nf-portcls-pcregisterphysicalconnection.md">PcRegisterPhysicalConnection</a>, <a href="..\portcls\nf-portcls-pcregisterphysicalconnectionfromexternal.md">PcRegisterPhysicalConnectionFromExternal</a>, or <a href="..\portcls\nf-portcls-pcregisterphysicalconnectiontoexternal.md">PcRegisterPhysicalConnectionToExternal</a> routines. PortCls supports the three PcRegisterPhysicalConnection<i>Xxx</i> routines.

The port driver uses the information that it obtains from PcRegisterPhysicalConnection<i>Xxx</i> calls to respond to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565205">KSPROPERTY_PIN_PHYSICALCONNECTION</a> property requests.

When deleting a subdevice from an adapter's topology, the driver must unregister the subdevice's physical connections to that portion of the topology. Failure to unregister the subdevice's physical connections can cause memory leaks.



## -inheritance
The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IUnregisterPhysicalConnection</b> interface inherits from the <a href="com.iunknown" xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n"><b>IUnknown</b></a> interface. <b>IUnregisterPhysicalConnection</b> also has these types of members:

The <b>IUnregisterPhysicalConnection</b> interface has these methods.

The <code>UnregisterPhysicalConnection</code> method deletes the registration of a physical connection that was registered by a previous call to <a href="..\portcls\nf-portcls-pcregisterphysicalconnection.md">PcRegisterPhysicalConnection</a>.

The <b>UnregisterPhysicalConnectionFromExternal</b> method deletes the registration of a physical connection that was registered by a previous call to <a href="..\portcls\nf-portcls-pcregisterphysicalconnectionfromexternal.md">PcRegisterPhysicalConnectionFromExternal</a>.

The <code>UnregisterPhysicalConnectionToExternal</code> method deletes the registration of a physical connection that was registered by a previous call to <a href="..\portcls\nf-portcls-pcregisterphysicalconnectiontoexternal.md">PcRegisterPhysicalConnectionToExternal</a>.
