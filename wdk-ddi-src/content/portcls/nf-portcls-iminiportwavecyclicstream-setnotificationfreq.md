# SetNotificationFreq method
The <code>SetNotificationFreq</code> method controls the frequency at which notification interrupts are generated by setting the interval between successive interrupts.

## Syntax

````
ULONG SetNotificationFreq(
  [in]  ULONG  Interval,
  [out] PULONG FrameSize
);
````

## Parameters

`Interval`

Specifies the interval between notification interrupts. This parameter value is expressed in milliseconds.

`FrameSize`

Output pointer for the frame size. This parameter points to a caller-allocated variable into which the method writes the maximum number of bytes that can be transferred in <i>Interval</i> milliseconds. This byte count determines the size of the buffer that needs to be allocated for the input or output stream.


## Return Value

<code>SetNotificationFreq</code> returns the new notification interval expressed in milliseconds. In all current Windows releases, the port driver ignores this value.

## Remarks

During each notification interrupt, the miniport driver's interrupt service routine calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536903">IPortWaveCyclic::Notify</a> method with the stream's <a href="..\portcls\nn-portcls-iservicegroup.md">IServiceGroup</a> object as the call parameter. This is the <b>IServiceGroup</b> object that the miniport driver previously output to the port driver during the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536723">IMiniportWaveCyclic::NewStream</a> call.

In all current Windows releases, the WaveCyclic port driver specifies an <i>Interval</i> value of 10 milliseconds. This value might change in future releases.
