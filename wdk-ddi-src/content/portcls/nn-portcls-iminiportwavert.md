# IMiniportWaveRT interface

The <code>IMiniportWaveRT</code> interface is the primary interface that is exposed by the miniport driver for a WaveRT audio device. The adapter driver creates the WaveRT miniport driver object. It then passes the <code>IMiniportWaveRT</code> interface pointer of the object to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/1735a8e8-56d0-4981-aca7-7bb4c2f22c00">IPort::Init </a> method of the WaveRT port driver. <code>IMiniportWaveRT</code> inherits from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536698">IMiniport</a> interface.

An adapter driver forms a miniport-port driver pair by binding an <code>IMiniportWaveRT</code> object to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536920">IPortWaveRT</a> object. The PortCls system driver registers this pair with the system as a wave filter.

<code>IMiniportWaveRT</code> is supported in Windows Vista and later Windows operating systems.

## Methods

<p>The <b>IMiniportWaveRT</b> interface has these methods.</p>

| Method | Description |
| ---- |:---- |
| [IMiniportWaveRT::GetDeviceDescription](nf-portcls-iminiportwavert-getdevicedescription.md) | The GetDeviceDescription method returns a pointer to a DEVICE_DESCRIPTION structure describing the device. |
| [IMiniportWaveRT::Init](nf-portcls-iminiportwavert-init.md) | The Init method initializes the WaveRT miniport driver object. |
| [IMiniportWaveRT::NewStream](nf-portcls-iminiportwavert-newstream.md) | The NewStream method creates a new instance of a WaveRT stream object. |
