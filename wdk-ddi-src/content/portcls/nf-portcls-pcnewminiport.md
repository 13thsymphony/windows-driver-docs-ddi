# PcNewMiniport function
The <b>PcNewMiniport</b> function creates an instance of one of the system-supplied miniport drivers that are built into the PortCls system driver, portcls.sys. A class ID specifies which of these miniport drivers to instantiate. The driver supports a miniport interface that is derived from <a href="..\portcls\nn-portcls-iminiport.md">IMiniport</a>.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS PcNewMiniport(
  _Out_ PMINIPORT *OutMiniport,
  _In_  REFCLSID  ClassId
);
````

## Parameters

`OutMiniPort`

TBD

`ClassID`

TBD


## Return Value

<b>PcNewMiniport</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call was successful. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate error code.

## Remarks

The system-supplied miniport drivers for MPU-401 UARTs and OPL3 synthesizers can be instantiated by calling <b>PcNewMiniport</b> These are built-in miniport drivers that are provided with the portcls.sys system driver. Miniport drivers that are part of a vendor's adapter driver are not created in this way.

The <i>ClassId</i> parameter can be set to one of the GUIDs in the following table.

The first two GUIDs in the preceding table are defined in header file dmusicks.h; the last three are defined in portcls.h.

The DMusUART miniport driver outputs MIDI data to a synth device with a pure MPU-401 MIDI interface. To produce sound, this device needs an external MIDI sound module attached to it.

The DMusUARTCapture miniport driver inputs MIDI data from a capture device with a pure MPU-401 interface.

The FMSynth miniport driver outputs MIDI data to a synth device that implements OPL3-style FM synthesis. The <b>CLSID_MiniportDriverFmSynth</b> GUID is appropriate for most FM synth devices. However, devices such as the Windows Sound System that do not provide a hardware volume control after the FM synth should use the <b>CLSID_MiniportDriverFmSynthWithVol</b> GUID instead. In Windows Server SP1 and later, the FMSynth miniport driver is available only in 32-bit versions of the operating system.

The UART miniport driver is obsolete. New adapter driver code should use the DMusUART miniport driver, which supersedes UART and implements a superset of its functionality.

Microsoft provides the source code for the DMusUART and FMSynth miniport drivers, which can serve as a starting point for hardware vendors who might need to extend these drivers to manage additional device capabilities. Look in the sample audio drivers in the Windows Driver Kit (WDK).

The <i>OutMiniport</i> parameter follows the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e6b19110-37e2-4d23-a528-6393c12ab650">reference-counting conventions for COM objects</a>.
