# PcRequestNewPowerState function
The <b>PcRequestNewPowerState</b> function is used to request a new power state for the device. This function is typically not needed by adapter drivers but can occasionally be useful in working around some kinds of hardware problems.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS PcRequestNewPowerState(
  _In_ PDEVICE_OBJECT     pDeviceObject,
  _In_ DEVICE_POWER_STATE RequestedNewState
);
````

## Parameters

`pDeviceObject`

Pointer to the adapter's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f697e0db-1db0-4a81-94d8-0ca079885480">functional device object (FDO)</a>. This parameter must point to a system structure of type <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_device_object.md">DEVICE_OBJECT</a>.

`RequestedNewState`

Specifies the device power state being requested. Set this parameter to one of the following DEVICE_POWER_STATE enumeration values: <b>PowerDeviceD0</b>, <b>PowerDeviceD1</b>, <b>PowerDeviceD2</b>, or <b>PowerDeviceD3</b>.


## Return Value

<b>PcRequestNewPowerState</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call was successful. Otherwise, returns an appropriate error message.

## Remarks

An adapter driver can call <b>PcRequestNewPowerState</b> to compensate for hardware design flaws. For example, if the functions in an audio adapter are not mutually independent and need to be shut down in a particular order, the adapter can call <b>PcRequestNewPowerState</b> to ensure that a particular subdevice is shut down first.

The <b>RequestedNewState</b> parameter can be set to one of the DEVICE_POWER_STATE enumeration values in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Power State</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<b>PowerDeviceD0</b>

</td>
<td>
Full power state

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<b>PowerDeviceD1</b>

</td>
<td>
The sleep state with the lowest power-up latency

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<b>PowerDeviceD2</b>

</td>
<td>
A medium-latency sleep state

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<b>PowerDeviceD3</b>

</td>
<td>
A full hibernation state and the sleep state with the longest power-up latency

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

The hardware can be accessed only in power state <b>PowerDeviceD0</b>. In any other state, the driver must cache any attempted hardware accesses and defer those accesses until the <b>PowerDeviceD0</b> state is restored.
