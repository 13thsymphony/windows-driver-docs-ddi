# PCNODE_DESCRIPTOR structure



## -description
The <b>PCNODE_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure describes a node in the filter that a topology miniport driver implements.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct {
  ULONG                    Flags;
  const PCAUTOMATION_TABLE *AutomationTable;
  const GUID               *Type;
  const GUID               *Name;
} PCNODE_DESCRIPTOR, *PPCNODE_DESCRIPTOR;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Flags

Set to zero. No flag bits are currently defined.


### -field AutomationTable

Pointer to the automation table, which is a structure of type <a href="audio.pcautomation_table">PCAUTOMATION_TABLE</a>. This member can be set to <b>NULL</b> to indicate no automation support. The automation table specifies the handlers for the properties and events belonging to the node instance.


### -field Type

Specifies the node type. This member is a pointer to a GUID that uniquely identifies the node type. See the list of node-type GUIDs in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536219">Audio Topology Nodes</a>.


### -field Name

Pointer to a GUID that represents the name of this topology node. This GUID is specified in a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565809">KSPROPERTY_TOPOLOGY_NAME</a>get-property request to obtain the corresponding name string for the node. This pointer can be set to <b>NULL</b> to indicate that the GUID in the <b>Type</b> member should be used to determine the node name.


## -remarks
If a filter contains only a single node of the type specified by the <b>Type</b> member, then the <b>Name</b> member can be specified as <b>NULL</b> because the <b>Type</b> value is sufficient to uniquely identify the node within the filter. If the filter contains two or more nodes of the same type, the <b>Name</b> members for those nodes must be non-<b>NULL</b>.

For example, if a filter contains a single SUM node, the <b>Type</b> member for that node points to GUID value <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537196">KSNODETYPE_SUM</a>, and the <b>Name</b> member is set to <b>NULL</b>. When queried for the name of that node, the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565809">KSPROPERTY_TOPOLOGY_NAME</a> property, after determining that the node's <b>Name</b> value is <b>NULL</b>, retrieves the name string from the registry entry for the KSNODETYPE_SUM GUID. However, the same filter might contain several volume nodes, in which case the <b>Type</b> values for these nodes all point to the same GUID value, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537208">KSNODETYPE_VOLUME</a>, and the <b>Name</b> value must uniquely identify each of the volume nodes. The <b>Name</b> value for the wave-input volume control node, for example, should point to GUID value KSAUDFNAME_WAVE_IN_VOLUME (defined in ksmedia.h). The registry entry for this GUID contains the name string that the KSPROPERTY_TOPOLOGY_NAME property retrieves for the node.

The <a href="..\portcls\ns-portcls-__unnamed_struct_0c40_9.md">PCFILTER_DESCRIPTOR</a> structure contains a pointer to an array of <b>PCNODE_DESCRIPTOR</b> structures.

For a simple code example that shows how the <b>PCNODE_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure is used, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/bf791f40-b2fb-48fe-8350-3b926db4ead7">Exposing Filter Topology</a>.
