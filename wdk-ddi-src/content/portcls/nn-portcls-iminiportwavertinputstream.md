# IMiniportWaveRTInputStream interface



## -description
<p>The <code>IMiniportWaveRTInputStream</code> interface represents the input wave stream that flows through a pin on the KS filter that wraps a WaveRT rendering or capture device. <code>IMiniportWaveRTInputStream</code> inherits from the <b>IUnknown</b> interface.</p>
<p>A driver can implement this interface for better coordination of audio dataflow from the driver to OS. If this interface is available on a capture stream, the OS uses methods on this interface to access data in the WaveRt buffer. 
     <code>IMiniportWaveRTInputStream</code> is supported in WindowsÂ 10 and later.</p>


## -inheritance
<p>The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IMiniportWaveRTInputStream</b> interface inherits from the <a href="com.iunknown" xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n"><b>IUnknown</b></a> interface but does not have additional members.</p>
