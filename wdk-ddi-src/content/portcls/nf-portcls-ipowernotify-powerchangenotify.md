# IPowerNotify::PowerChangeNotify method
The <code>PowerChangeNotify</code> method notifies the miniport driver of changes in the power state.

## Syntax

```
void PowerChangeNotify(
  POWER_STATE PowerState
);
```

## Parameters

`PowerState`

Specifies the current power state. This parameter is a union of type POWER_STATE. The new power state (<i>PowerState</i>.<b>DeviceState</b>) can be one of the DEVICE_POWER_STATE enumeration values listed in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536488">IAdapterPowerManagement::PowerChangeState</a>.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

The PortCls system driver calls the miniport driver's <code>PowerChangeNotify</code> method to notify it of changes in the power state. The purpose of this call is to give the miniport driver an opportunity to save any hardware-specific context just before powering down or to restore a previously saved context just after powering up.

The miniport driver can write to the hardware registers or on-board memory during the <code>PowerChangeNotify</code> call. If the system is powering down (making a state transition away from PowerDeviceD0), the PortCls system driver calls <code>PowerChangeNotify</code> before it calls <b>IAdapterPowerManagement::PowerChangeState</b> and after it has paused any active audio data streams. This gives the miniport driver an opportunity to save any hardware-specific device context before the device powers down. For example, a WavePci miniport driver might need to save its DMA registers if the power down occurs during a sequence of scatter/gather data transfers. If the system is powering up (making a state transition toward PowerDeviceD0), PortCls calls <code>PowerChangeNotify</code> after it calls <b>PowerChangeState</b> and before it restarts any paused audio data streams. This gives the miniport driver an opportunity to restore a previously saved context after the device has powered up.

The code for this method must reside in paged memory.
