# FWPS_PACKET_INJECTION_STATE_ Enumeration
The FWPS_PACKET_INJECTION_STATE enumeration type specifies the injection state of a network buffer
  list.

## Syntax
````
typedef enum FWPS_PACKET_INJECTION_STATE_ { 
  FWPS_PACKET_NOT_INJECTED                 = 0,
  FWPS_PACKET_INJECTED_BY_SELF,
  FWPS_PACKET_INJECTED_BY_OTHER,
  FWPS_PACKET_PREVIOUSLY_INJECTED_BY_SELF,
  FWPS_PACKET_INJECTION_STATE_MAX
} FWPS_PACKET_INJECTION_STATE;
````

     the packet was later cloned and reinjected by an additional call to a packet injection function,
