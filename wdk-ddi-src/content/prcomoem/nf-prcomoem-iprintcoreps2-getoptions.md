# IPrintCorePS2::GetOptions method



## -description
The <code>IPrintCorePS2::GetOptions</code> method retrieves the driver's current feature settings in the format of a list of feature/option keyword pairs.



## -syntax

````
HRESULT GetOptions(
  [in]  PDEVOBJ pdevobj,
  [in]  DWORD   dwFlags,
  [in]  PCSTR   pmszFeaturesRequested,
  [in]  DWORD   cbIn,
  [out] PSTR    pmszFeatureOptionBuf,
  [in]  DWORD   cbSize,
  [out] PDWORD  pcbNeeded
);
````


## -parameters

### -param pdevobj [in]

Pointer to a <a href="print.devobj">DEVOBJ</a> structure.


### -param dwFlags [in]

Is reserved and must be set to zero.


### -param pmszFeaturesRequested [in]

Pointer to caller-supplied buffer containing a list of feature keywords (in MULTI_SZ format) whose settings are requested. Set this parameter to <b>NULL</b> to obtain settings for all features.


### -param cbIn [in]

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by <i>pmszFeaturesRequested</i>. The size includes the last MULTI_SZ null character.


### -param pmszFeatureOptionBuf [out]

Pointer to a caller-supplied buffer that receives a list of feature/option keyword pairs (in MULTI_SZ format) obtained from the driver settings. Each feature/option keyword pair contains the feature keyword name, a null character, the option keyword name, and another null character. The list is terminated by two NULL characters.


### -param cbSize [in]

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by <i>pmszFeatureOptionBuf</i>.


### -param pcbNeeded [out]

Pointer to a memory location that receives the actual size, in bytes, of the requested data.


## -returns
The method must return one of the following values.
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The method succeeded.
<dl>
<dt><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b></dt>
</dl>The value in <i>cbSize</i> was smaller than the number of bytes to be written to the output buffer (the buffer pointed to by <i>pmszFeatureOptionBuf</i>).

The method was called with <i>pmszFeatureOptionBuf</i> set to <b>NULL</b>.
<dl>
<dt><b>E_INVALIDARG</b></dt>
</dl>The input buffer (the buffer pointed to by <i>pmszFeaturesRequested</i>) was provided, but its contents were not in MULTI_SZ format.

The <i>pdevobj</i> parameter pointed to an invalid driver context object.
<dl>
<dt><b>E_NOTIMPL</b></dt>
</dl>The method is not supported.
<dl>
<dt><b>E_FAIL</b></dt>
</dl>The method failed.

 


## -remarks
This method supports both <a href="wdkgloss.d#wdkgloss.document-sticky#wdkgloss.document-sticky"><i>document-sticky</i></a> and <a href="wdkgloss.p#wdkgloss.printer-sticky#wdkgloss.printer-sticky"><i>printer-sticky</i></a> features. It is supported only after the core driver finishes its <a href="display.drvenablepdev">DrvEnablePDEV</a> processing, which sets up all option settings. A call to <code>IPrintCorePS2::GetOptions</code> when it is not supported should cause it to return E_NOTIMPL. For example, when the core driver calls a render plug-in's <a href="print.iprintoemps_enablepdev">IPrintOemPS::EnablePDEV</a> method, the driver is still occupied with its <b>DrvEnablePDEV</b> processing, so if the plug-in calls <code>IPrintCorePS2::GetOptions</code> within the plug-in's <b>IPrintOemPS::DevMode</b> method, the plug-in receives the E_NOTIMPL return value. However, because the plug-in's <b>IPrintOemPS::EnablePDEV</b> method is called after the core driver finishes its <b>DrvEnablePDEV</b> processing, the plug-in is able to call <code>IPrintCorePS2::GetOptions</code> successfully within its <b>IPrintOemPS::EnablePDEV</b> method.

If a requested feature keyword is not recognized, or the feature is recognized but there is currently no option selection for it, the feature is ignored and the feature/option keyword pair is not placed in the output buffer.

To reduce the need to make two calls per data access, pass the method an output buffer of a fixed size (1 KB, for example), and then check the function return value. If the method returns S_OK, the buffer already contains the data of interest. If the method returns E_OUTOFMEMORY, the value in *<i>pcbNeeded</i> is the buffer size needed to hold the data of interest. The caller should then allocate a buffer of that larger size and proceed with a second call to the method.

This method is supported for any Pscript5 render plug-in.
