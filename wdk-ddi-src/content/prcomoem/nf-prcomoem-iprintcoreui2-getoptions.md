# IPrintCoreUI2::GetOptions method



## -description
The <code>IPrintCoreUI2::GetOptions</code> method retrieves the driver's current feature settings in the format of a list of feature/option keyword pairs.



## -syntax

````
HRESULT GetOptions(
  [in]  POEMUIOBJ poemuiobj,
  [in]  DWORD     dwFlags,
  [in]  PCSTR     pmszFeaturesRequested,
  [in]  DWORD     cbIn,
  [out] PSTR      pmszFeatureOptionBuf,
  [in]  DWORD     cbSize,
  [out] PDWORD    pcbNeeded
);
````


## -parameters

### -param poemuiobj [in]

Pointer to the current context, an <a href="..\printoem\ns-printoem-_oemuiobj.md">OEMUIOBJ</a> structure.


### -param dwFlags [in]

Is reserved and must be set to zero.


### -param pmszFeaturesRequested [in]

Pointer to caller-supplied buffer containing a list of feature keywords (in MULTI_SZ format) whose settings are requested. Set this parameter to <b>NULL</b> to obtain settings for all features.


### -param cbIn [in]

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by <i>pmszFeaturesRequested</i>. The size includes the last MULTI_SZ null character.


### -param pmszFeatureOptionBuf [out]

Pointer to a caller-supplied buffer that receives a list of feature/option keyword pairs (in MULTI_SZ format) obtained from the driver settings. Each feature/option keyword pair contains the feature keyword name, a null character, the option keyword name, and another null character. The list is terminated by two null characters.


### -param cbSize [in]

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by <i>pmszFeatureOptionBuf</i>.


### -param pcbNeeded [out]

Pointer to a memory location that receives the actual size, in bytes, of the feature/option keyword pairs.


## -returns
The method must return one of the following values.
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The method succeeded.
<dl>
<dt><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b></dt>
</dl>The value in <i>cbSize</i> was smaller than the number of bytes to be written to the output buffer (the buffer pointed to by <i>pmszFeatureOptionBuf</i>).

The method was called with <i>pmszFeatureOptionBuf</i> set to <b>NULL</b>.
<dl>
<dt><b>E_INVALIDARG</b></dt>
</dl>The input buffer (the buffer pointed to by <i>pmszFeaturesRequested</i>) was provided, but its contents were not in MULTI_SZ format.

The <i>poemuiobj</i> parameter pointed to an invalid context object.
<dl>
<dt><b>E_NOTIMPL</b></dt>
</dl>The method is not supported.
<dl>
<dt><b>E_FAIL</b></dt>
</dl>The method failed

 


## -remarks
This method is supported only for Windows XP Pscript5 UI plug-ins that fully replace the core driver's standard UI pages, and is supported only during the UI plug-in's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554173">IPrintOemUI::DocumentPropertySheets</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554165">IPrintOemUI::DevicePropertySheets</a> functions, and their property sheet callback routines. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b7f79841-f82c-4a60-9c2f-58772a65a5eb">Replacing Driver-Supplied Property Sheet Pages</a> for more information.

If a requested feature keyword is not recognized, or recognized but not supported in the current sticky mode (<a href="wdkgloss.d#wdkgloss.document-sticky#wdkgloss.document-sticky"><i>document-sticky</i></a> or <a href="wdkgloss.p#wdkgloss.printer-sticky#wdkgloss.printer-sticky"><i>printer-sticky</i></a> -- see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b7f79841-f82c-4a60-9c2f-58772a65a5eb">Replacing Driver-Supplied Property Sheet Pages</a>), or the feature keyword is recognized but there is currently no option selection for it, the feature is simply ignored and the feature/option keyword pair is not placed in the output buffer.

To reduce the need to make two calls per data access, pass the method an output buffer of a fixed size (1 KB, for example), and then check the function return value. If the method returns S_OK, the buffer already contains the data of interest. If the method returns E_OUTOFMEMORY, the value in *<i>pcbNeeded</i> is the buffer size needed to hold the data of interest. The caller should then allocate a buffer of that larger size and proceed with a second call to the method.
