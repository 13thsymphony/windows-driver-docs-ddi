# IPrintOemUIMXDC::AdjustDPI method
The <code>IPrintOemUIMXDC::AdjustDPI</code> method enables an XPS filter pipeline driver to use UnidrvUI.dll or PS5UI.dll to support configuration of image resolution.

## Syntax

```
HRESULT AdjustDPI(
  HANDLE         hPrinter,
  DWORD          cbDevMode,
  CONST PDEVMODE pDevMode,
  DWORD          cbOEMDM,
  CONST PVOID    pOEMDM,
  PLONG          pDPI
);
```

## Parameters

`hPrinter`

A handle to the printer that is currently being queried.

`cbDevMode`

The size of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b2369876-9a79-40c8-8d27-c8b9d8e68e6b">DEVMODE</a> structure, including appended data.

`pDevMode`

A pointer to the DEVMODE structure that contains the current device settings.

`cbOEMDM`

The number of bytes in the vendor-provided section of the DEVMODE structure.

`pOEMDM`

A pointer to the data that is contained in the vendor portion of the DEVMODE structure that <i>pDevMode</i> points to.

`pDPI`

A pointer to the current resolution, in dots per inch (DPI), assuming square pixels. If this parameter is configured, its returned value must be a positive integer.


## Return Value

<code>AdjustDPI</code> returns S_OK if the method succeeds. Otherwise, this method should return E_NOTIMPL if the plug-in does not support the method, or any appropriate failure value if the plug-in cannot complete the operation. For more information, see the following Remarks section.

## Remarks

The <i>pDPI</i> parameter is IN OUT. All other parameters for this function are input only.

If the plug-in cannot complete the operation, it should return an appropriate failure HRESULT, which causes the current print job to fail.
