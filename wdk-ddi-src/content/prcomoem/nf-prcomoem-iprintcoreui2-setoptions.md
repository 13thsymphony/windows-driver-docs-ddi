# SetOptions method
The <code>IPrintCoreUI2::SetOptions</code> method sets the driver's feature settings.

## Syntax

````
HRESULT SetOptions(
  [in]  POEMUIOBJ poemuiobj,
  [in]  DWORD     dwFlags,
  [in]  PCSTR     pmszFeatureOptionBuf,
  [in]  DWORD     cbIn,
  [out] PDWORD    pdwResult
);
````

## Parameters

`poemuiobj`

Pointer to the current context, an <a href="..\printoem\ns-printoem-_oemuiobj.md">OEMUIOBJ</a> structure.

`dwFlags`

Specifies whether the core driver is to resolve conflicts. This parameter must be set to one of the following values:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
SETOPTIONS_FLAG_KEEP_CONFLICT

</td>
<td>
Ask core driver to not resolve any conflict that arises.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
SETOPTIONS_FLAG_RESOLVE_CONFLICT

</td>
<td>
Ask core driver to resolve any conflict that arises.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`pmszFeatureOptionBuf`

Pointer to a caller-supplied buffer containing a list of feature/option keyword pairs in MULTI_SZ format. Each item in this list is separated from the next by a null character, and the list is terminated with two null characters.

`cbIn`

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by <i>pmszFeatureOptionBuf</i>. This size includes the last MULTI_SZ null character.

`pdwResult`

Pointer to a memory location that receives one of the following values. These constants are defined in printoem.h.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
SETOPTIONS_RESULT_CONFLICT_REMAINED

</td>
<td>
The core driver found conflicts, but has left them unresolved.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
SETOPTIONS_RESULT_CONFLICT_RESOLVED

</td>
<td>
The core driver found and resolved all conflicts.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
SETOPTIONS_RESULT_NO_CONFLICT

</td>
<td>
The core driver did not find any conflict.

</td>
</tr>
</table>


## Return Value

The method must return one of the following values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>

<td width="60%">
The method succeeded.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_NOTIMPL</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method is not supported.

A structure of the type specified by <i>dwLevel</i> is not supported.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_INVALIDARG</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The value in <i>dwFlags</i> was incorrect.

The input buffer (pointed to by <i>pmszFeatureOptionBuf</i>) was not in MULTI_SZ format.

The <i>poemuiobj</i> parameter pointed to an invalid context object.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_FAIL</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method failed

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

This method is supported only for Windows XP Pscript5 plug-ins, not for Unidrv plug-ins.

This method is called to set the driver's feature settings using a list of feature/option keyword pairs. The caller can access the resultant feature settings using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553069">IPrintCoreUI2::GetOptions</a> method. 

If this method returns any value other than S_OK, then it did not make any change in the driver's feature settings.

The <i>pmszFeatureOptionBuf</i> input buffer must be constructed in the same way as the output buffer of the <b>IPrintCoreUI2::GetOptions</b> method. That is, the feature/option keyword pairs must be in MULTI_SZ format, and each item in the list is separated from the next by a null character. A pair of null characters terminates the list.

If the input buffer contains a feature keyword or its option keyword that is not recognized, or the feature is recognized but not supported in the current sticky mode (see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b7f79841-f82c-4a60-9c2f-58772a65a5eb">Replacing Driver-Supplied Property Sheet Pages</a>), then the feature/option pair is ignored, and the current option for that feature continues to be in effect.

This method is supported only for UI plug-ins that fully replace the core driver's standard UI pages, and is supported only during the UI plug-in's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554173">IPrintOemUI::DocumentPropertySheets</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554165">IPrintOemUI::DevicePropertySheets</a> functions, and their property sheet callback routines.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c8b5c235-0b74-47c8-b6ba-eba810a8467b">Using GetOptions and SetOptions</a>.
