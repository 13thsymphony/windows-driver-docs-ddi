# IPrintOemUIMXDC::AdjustImageCompression method



## -description
The <code>IPrintOemUIMXDC::AdjustImageCompression</code> method allows an XPS filter pipeline driver to use UnidrvUI.dll or PS5UI.dll to support configuration of compression level for JPEG or PNG images.



## -syntax

````
HRESULT AdjustImageCompression(
         HANDLE   hPrinter,
         DWORD    cbDevMode,
   const PDEVMODE pDevMode,
         DWORD    cbOEMDM,
   const PVOID    pOEMDM,
         PLONG    pCompressionMode
);
````


## -parameters

### -param hPrinter 

A handle to the printer that is currently being queried.


### -param cbDevMode 

The size of the <a href="display.devmodew">DEVMODE</a> structure, including appended data.


### -param pDevMode 

A pointer to the DEVMODE structure that contains the current device settings.


### -param cbOEMDM 

The number of bytes in the vendor-provided section of the DEVMODE structure.


### -param pOEMDM 

A pointer to the data that is contained in the vendor portion of the DEVMODE structure that <i>pDevMode</i> points to.


### -param pCompressionMode 

A pointer to the current compression level. <i>pCompressionMode</i> is an enum type specified in Mxdc.h.


## -returns
<code>AdjustImageCompression</code> returns S_OK if the method succeeds. Otherwise, this method should return E_NOTIMPL if the plug-in does not support the method, or any appropriate failure value if the plug-in cannot complete the operation. For more information, see the following Remarks section.


## -remarks
The <code>IPrintOemUIMXDC::AdjustImageCompression</code> method affects JPEG and PNG images that are generated by Microsoft XPS Document Converter (MXDC). The <code>IPrintOemUIMXDC::AdjustImageCompression</code> method does not affect the JPEG and PNG images that are sent directly by applications to GDI via the GDI JPEG/PNG image pass-through mechanism (<a href="display.devinfo">BMF_JPEG</a>, <b>BMF_PNG</b>).

The core drivers, UnidrvUI.dll and PS5UI.dll, do not modify the image compression settings. The plug-in, however, can change the value that is initially provided to the MXDC by the GDI print path.

The <i>pCompressionMode</i> parameter has one of the following predefined values.

MXDC_IMAGETYPE_JPEGHIGH_COMPRESSION

1                            

Lowest quality and smallest file size

MXDC_IMAGETYPE_JPEGMEDIUM_COMPRESSION

2                            

Medium quality and medium file size

MXDC_IMAGETYPE_JPEGLOW_COMPRESSION

3

High quality and large file size

MXDC_IMAGETYPE_PNG

4

Highest quality and largest file size

The <i>pCompressionMode</i> parameter is IN OUT. All other parameters for this function are input only.

If the plug-in cannot complete the operation, it should return an appropriate failure HRESULT, which causes the current print job to fail.
