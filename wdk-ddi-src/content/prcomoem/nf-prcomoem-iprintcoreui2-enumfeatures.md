# EnumFeatures method
The <code>IPrintCoreUI2::EnumFeatures</code> method enumerates a printer's available features.

## Syntax

````
HRESULT EnumFeatures(
  [in]  POEMUIOBJ poemuiobj,
  [in]  DWORD     dwFlags,
  [out] PSTR      pmszFeatureList,
  [in]  DWORD     cbSize,
  [out] PDWORD    pcbNeeded
);
````

## Parameters

`poemuiobj`

Pointer to the current context, an <a href="..\printoem\ns-printoem-_oemuiobj.md">OEMUIOBJ</a> structure.

`dwFlags`

Is reserved and must be set to zero.

`pmszFeatureList`

Pointer to a caller-supplied buffer that receives a null-delimited list of feature keywords in MULTI_SZ format. The list is terminated with two null characters.

Set this parameter to <b>NULL</b> to simply query for the size (*<i>pcbNeeded</i>) of the feature list without having the list filled in.

`cbSize`

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by <i>pmszFeatureList</i>.

`pcbNeeded`

Pointer to a memory location that receives the actual size, in bytes, of the feature list.


## Return Value

This method must return one of the following values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method succeeded.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The value in <i>cbSize</i> was smaller than the number of bytes to be written to the output buffer (the buffer pointed to by <i>pmszFeatureList</i>).

The method was called with <i>pmszFeatureList</i> set to <b>NULL</b>.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_INVALIDARG</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The <i>poemuiobj</i> parameter pointed to an invalid context object.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_FAIL</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method failed

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

This method is supported only for Windows XP Pscript5 plug-ins, not for Unidrv plug-ins. 

<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/139a10e9-203b-499b-9291-8537eae9189c">printer-sticky</a> features (see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b7f79841-f82c-4a60-9c2f-58772a65a5eb">Replacing Driver-Supplied Property Sheet Pages</a>), such as those that determine installable memory and the presence of optional accessories, are included in the feature keyword list, which appears in the output buffer pointed to by <i>pmszFeatureList</i> when the method returns. For Pscript5, such features have the <b>OpenGroupType</b> feature attribute set to "InstallableOptions". 

To reduce the need to make two calls per data access, pass the method an output buffer of a fixed size (1 KB, for example), and then check the function return value. If the method returns S_OK, the buffer already contains the data of interest. If the method returns E_OUTOFMEMORY, the value in *<i>pcbNeeded</i> is the buffer size needed to hold the data of interest. The caller should then allocate a buffer of that larger size and proceed with a second call to the method.
