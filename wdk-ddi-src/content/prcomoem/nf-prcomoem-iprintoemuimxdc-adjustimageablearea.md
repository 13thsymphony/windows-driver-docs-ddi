# IPrintOemUIMXDC::AdjustImageableArea method
The <code>IPrintOemUIMXDC::AdjustImageableArea</code> method enables an XPS filter pipeline driver to use UnidrvUI.dll or PS5UI.dll to support configuration of the printable area, including orientation and direction of rotation.

## Syntax

```
HRESULT AdjustImageableArea(
  HANDLE         hPrinter,
  DWORD          cbDevMode,
  CONST PDEVMODE pDevMode,
  DWORD          cbOEMDM,
  CONST PVOID    pOEMDM,
  PRECTL         prclImageableArea
);
```

## Parameters

`hPrinter`

A handle to the printer that is currently being queried.

`cbDevMode`

The size of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b2369876-9a79-40c8-8d27-c8b9d8e68e6b">DEVMODE</a> structure, in bytes, including appended data.

`pDevMode`

A pointer to the DEVMODE structure that contains the current device settings.

`cbOEMDM`

The number of bytes in the vendor-provided section of the DEVMODE structure.

`pOEMDM`

A pointer to the data that is contained in the vendor portion of the DEVMODE structure that <i>pDevMode</i> points to.

`prclImageableArea`

A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569236">RECTL</a> structure that contains the printable area. This parameter is populated by UnidrvUI.dll or PS5UI.dll with data from the corresponding GPD or PPD, before the parameter is passed to the plug-in. The plug-in can then update this data before returning.


## Return Value

<code>AdjustImageableArea</code> returns S_OK if this method succeeds. Otherwise, this method should return E_NOTIMPL if the plug-in does not support the method, or any appropriate failure value if the plug-in cannot complete the operation. For more information, see the following Remarks section.

## Remarks

The <i>prclImageableArea</i> parameter is IN OUT. All other parameters for this method are input only.

If the plug-in cannot complete the operation, it should return an appropriate failure HRESULT value, which willcause the current print job to fail.

## Requirements
