# EnumConstrainedOptions method
The <b>IPrintCoreHelperPS::EnumConstrainedOptions</b> method provides a list of all of the options that are constrained in a particular feature, based on current settings.

## Syntax

````
STDMETHOD EnumConstrainedOptions(
  [in, optional] CONST DEVMODE *pDevmode,
  [in]           DWORD         cbSize,
  [in]           PCSTR         pszFeatureKeyword,
  [out]          PCSTR         *pConstrainedOptionList[],
  [out]          DWORD         *pdwNumOptions
);
````

## Parameters

`pDevmode`

A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552837">DEVMODEW</a> structure. If this pointer is provided, <b>IPrintCoreHelperPS::EnumConstrainedOptions</b> should use the DEVMODEW structure that is pointed to by <i>pDevmode</i> instead of the default or current DEVMODEW structure. If this method is called from the plug-in provider or from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553205">IPrintOemPS::DevMode</a>, this parameter is required. In most other situations, the parameter should be <b>NULL</b>. When the core driver sets <i>pDevmode</i> to <b>NULL</b>, it modifies its internal state rather than that of the passed-in DEVMODEW structure. This is required during operations such as full UI replacement, where the DEVMODEW structure returned by a DDI, such as <a href="..\winddiui\nf-winddiui-drvdocumentpropertysheets.md">DrvDocumentPropertySheets</a>, is being serviced by the core driver's UI module.

`cbSize`

The size, in bytes, of the DEVMODEW structure that is pointed to by the <i>pDevmode</i> parameter.

`pszFeatureKeyword`

A string of ANSI characters that contains the feature name.

`pConstrainedOptionList`



`pdwNumOptions`

A pointer to a variable that receives the number of constrained options in the array that is pointed to by the <i>pConstrainedOptionList</i> parameter.


## Return Value

<b>IPrintCoreHelperPS::EnumConstrainedOptions</b> should return one of the following values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The constrained options were set for the specified feature.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_FAIL</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The caller provided information that resulted in an invalid request, such as a request for a feature that does not exist.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_INVALIDARG</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
One or more of the arguments were invalid. This value might mean that the feature is not supported.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
There was not enough memory to create the options array or the core driver could not service the request because of lack of memory. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_UNEXPECTED, or other failures not listed here</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
An unexpected condition occurred. The core driver is probably in an invalid state. The caller should exit with a failure code.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
