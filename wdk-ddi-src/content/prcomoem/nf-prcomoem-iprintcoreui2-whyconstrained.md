# WhyConstrained method
The <code>IPrintCoreUI2::WhyConstrained</code> method determines why the specified feature/option selection is constrained.

## Syntax

````
HRESULT WhyConstrained(
  [in]  POEMUIOBJ poemuiobj,
  [in]  DWORD     dwFlags,
  [in]  PCSTR     pszFeatureKeyword,
  [in]  PCSTR     pszOptionKeyword,
  [out] PSTR      pmszReasonList,
  [in]  DWORD     cbSize,
  [out] PDWORD    pcbNeeded
);
````

## Parameters

`poemuiobj`

Pointer to the current context, an <a href="..\printoem\ns-printoem-_oemuiobj.md">OEMUIOBJ</a> structure.

`dwFlags`

Is reserved and must be set to zero.

`pszFeatureKeyword`

Pointer to a caller-supplied buffer containing the single feature keyword of interest to the caller.

`pszOptionKeyword`

Pointer to a caller-supplied buffer containing the option keyword.

`pmszReasonList`

Pointer to a caller-supplied buffer that receives a list of the feature/option keyword pairs that place constraints on the specified feature/option. This list is in MULTI_SZ format with each item in the list separated from the next by a null character. The list is terminated with two null characters.

Set this parameter to <b>NULL</b> to simply query for the size (*<i>pcbNeeded</i>) of the reason list without having the list filled in.

`cbSize`

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by <i>pmszReasonList</i>.

`pcbNeeded`

Pointer to a memory location that receives the actual size, in bytes, of the reason list.


## Return Value

The method must return one of the following values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method succeeded.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The value in <i>cbSize</i> was smaller than the number of bytes to be written to the output buffer (the buffer pointed to by <i>pmszReasonList</i>).

The method was called with <i>pmszReasonList</i> set to <b>NULL</b>.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_NOTIMPL</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method is not supported.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_INVALIDARG</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The <i>poemuiobj</i> parameter pointed to an invalid context object.

The feature keyword or option keyword was not recognized.

The feature stickiness (see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b7f79841-f82c-4a60-9c2f-58772a65a5eb">Replacing Driver-Supplied Property Sheet Pages</a>) did not match that specified in the current context.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_FAIL</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method failed

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

This method is supported only for Windows XP Pscript5 UI plug-ins that fully replace the core driver's standard UI pages, and is supported only during the UI plug-in's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554173">IPrintOemUI::DocumentPropertySheets</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554165">IPrintOemUI::DevicePropertySheets</a> functions, and their property sheet callback routines. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b7f79841-f82c-4a60-9c2f-58772a65a5eb">Replacing Driver-Supplied Property Sheet Pages</a> for more information.

When a user of the OEM UI attempts to select an item that is constrained, the caller can use this method to display a message explaining why the item is constrained. When this method returns, <i>pmszReasonList</i> points to a list of one or more feature/option pairs that appear in the current driver settings, but conflict with the selected feature/option keywords. If there were no conflicts, the method should return S_OK, <i>pmszReasonList</i> should be filled in with an empty ASCII string containing only a null character, and *<i>pcbNeeded</i> should be set to 1.

To reduce the need to make two calls per data access, pass the method an output buffer of a fixed size (1 KB, for example), and then check the function return value. If the method returns S_OK, the buffer already contains the data of interest. If the method returns E_OUTOFMEMORY, the value in *<i>pcbNeeded</i> is the buffer size needed to hold the data of interest. The caller should then allocate a buffer of that larger size and proceed with a second call to the method.
