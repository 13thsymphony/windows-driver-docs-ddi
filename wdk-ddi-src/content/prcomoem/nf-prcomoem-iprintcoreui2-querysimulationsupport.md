# IPrintCoreUI2::QuerySimulationSupport method



## -description
The <code>IPrintCoreUI2::QuerySimulationSupport</code> method retrieves a spooler simulation capability structure, which indicates the kinds of simulation the spooler supports.



## -syntax

````
HRESULT QuerySimulationSupport(
  [in]  HANDLE hPrinter,
  [in]  DWORD  dwLevel,
  [out] PBYTE  pCaps,
  [in]  DWORD  cbSize,
  [out] PDWORD pcbNeeded
);
````


## -parameters

### -param hPrinter [in]

Specifies a handle to the printer.


### -param dwLevel [in]

Specifies the spooler simulation capability structure returned in the buffer pointed to by <i>pCaps</i>. Currently, only level 1 of spooler simulation support is provided.

</table>
 


### -param pCaps [out]

Pointer to the output buffer, which contains a structure of the type indicated by the value in the <i>dwLevel</i> parameter.


### -param cbSize [in]

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the output buffer, which is pointed to by <i>pCaps</i>.


### -param pcbNeeded [out]

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the memory needed to store a structure of the type indicated by <i>dwLevel</i>.


## -returns
The method must return one of the following values.
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The method succeeded.
<dl>
<dt><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b></dt>
</dl>The value in <i>cbSize</i> was smaller than the number of bytes to be written to the output buffer (the buffer pointed to by <i>pCaps</i>).

The method was called with <i>pCaps</i> set to <b>NULL</b>.
<dl>
<dt><b>E_NOTIMPL</b></dt>
</dl>The method is not supported.

A structure of the type specified by <i>dwLevel</i> is not supported.
<dl>
<dt><b>E_FAIL</b></dt>
</dl>The method failed

 


## -remarks
This method is supported only for Windows XP Pscript5 plug-ins, not for Unidrv plug-ins.

The <code>IPrintCoreUI2::QuerySimulationSupport</code> method stores a spooler simulation capability structure in the buffer pointed to by <i>pCaps</i>. This structure specifies the level of spooler support for "N-up" printing, reverse printing, the maximum number of pages that can be printed, collation, and others.
