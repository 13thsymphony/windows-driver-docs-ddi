# tagWNODE_TOO_SMALL structure
The <b>WNODE_TOO_SMALL</b> structure indicates the size of the buffer needed to receive output from a request.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct tagWNODE_TOO_SMALL {
  struct _WNODE_HEADER  WnodeHeader;
  ULONG                SizeNeeded;
} WNODE_TOO_SMALL, *PWNODE_TOO_SMALL;
````

## Members


`SizeNeeded`

Specifies the size of the buffer needed to receive all of the <b>WNODE_<i>XXX</i></b> data to be returned.

`WnodeHeader`

Is a <a href="..\wmistr\ns-wmistr-_wnode_header.md">WNODE_HEADER</a> structure that contains information common to all <b>WNODE_<i>XXX</i></b> structures, such as the buffer size, the GUID that represents a data block associated with a request, and flags that provide information about the <b>WNODE_<i>XXX</i></b> data being passed or returned.

## Remarks
When the buffer for a WMI request is too small to receive all of the data to be returned, a driver fills in a <b>WNODE_TOO_SMALL</b> structure to indicate the required buffer size. WMI can then increase the buffer to the recommended size and issue the request again. A driver is responsible for managing any side effects caused by handling the same request more than once.
