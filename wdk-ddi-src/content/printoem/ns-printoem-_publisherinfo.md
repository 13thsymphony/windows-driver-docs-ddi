# _PUBLISHERINFO structure
The PUBLISHERINFO structure is used as an input parameter to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553221">IPrintOemPS::GetInfo</a> method.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PUBLISHERINFO {
  DWORD dwMode;
  WORD  wMinoutlinePPEM;
  WORD  wMaxbitmapPPEM;
} PUBLISHERINFO, *PPUBLISHERINFO;
````

## Members


`dwMode`

Is a set of bit flags. The only flag defined is OEM_MODE_PUBLISHER, which must be set if a rendering plug-in for Pscript5 is using "publishing mode".

`wMaxbitmapPPEM`

Specifies the maximum font size, in pixels, for which the Pscript5 driver will download TrueType fonts as bitmap (Type 3) fonts. A font larger than the maximum setting will be downloaded as an outline (Type 1) font.

`wMinoutlinePPEM`

Specifies the minimum font size, in pixels, for which the Pscript5 driver will download TrueType fonts as outline (Type 1) fonts. A font smaller than the minimum setting will be downloaded as a bitmap (Type 3) font.
