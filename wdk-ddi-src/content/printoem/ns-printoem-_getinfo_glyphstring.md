# _GETINFO_GLYPHSTRING structure
The GETINFO_GLYPHSTRING structure is used as input to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563594">UNIFONTOBJ_GetInfo</a> callback function.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _GETINFO_GLYPHSTRING {
  DWORD dwSize;
  DWORD dwCount;
  DWORD dwTypeIn;
  PVOID pGlyphIn;
  DWORD dwTypeOut;
  PVOID pGlyphOut;
  DWORD dwGlyphOutSize;
} GETINFO_GLYPHSTRING, *PGETINFO_GLYPHSTRING;
````

## Members


`dwCount`

Specifies the number of elements in the arrays pointed to by <b>pGlyphIn</b> and <b>pGlyphOut</b>. This value is supplied by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563594">UNIFONTOBJ_GetInfo</a> caller.

`dwGlyphOutSize`

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by <b>pGlyphOut</b>. This member is used only when <b>dwTypeIn</b> has been set to TYPE_GLYPHHANDLE and <b>dwTypeOut</b> has been set to TYPE_TRANSDATA. See the following Remarks section for more information.

`dwSize`

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the GETINFO_GLYPHSTRING structure. This value is supplied by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563594">UNIFONTOBJ_GetInfo</a> caller.

`dwTypeIn`

Specifies the type of glyph specifier array pointed to by <b>pGlyphIn</b>. Valid values are as follows:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Definition</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
TYPE_GLYPHHANDLE

</td>
<td>
The <b>pGlyphIn</b> array elements are of type HGLYPH, or handle to a device font glyph. For this value of <b>dwTypeIn</b>, valid values for <b>dwTypeOut</b> are either TYPE_UNICODE or TYPE_TRANSDATA.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
TYPE_GLYPHID

</td>
<td>
The <b>pGlyphIn</b> array elements are of type DWORD, and contain glyph identifiers for downloaded TrueType font glyphs. For this value of <b>dwTypeIn</b>, valid values for <b>dwTypeOut</b> are either TYPE_UNICODE or TYPE_GLYPHHANDLE.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

Supplied by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563594">UNIFONTOBJ_GetInfo</a> caller.

`dwTypeOut`

Specifies the type of glyph specifier array pointed to by <b>pGlyphOut</b>. Valid values are as follows:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Definition</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
TYPE_GLYPHHANDLE

</td>
<td>
The <b>pGlyphOut</b> array elements are of type HGLYPH, or handle to a device font glyph. This value is valid only when <b>dwTypeIn</b> has been set to TYPE_GLYPHID.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
TYPE_TRANSDATA

</td>
<td>
The <b>pGlyphOut</b> array elements are of type <a href="..\prntfont\ns-prntfont-_transdata.md">TRANSDATA</a>. This value is valid only when <b>dwTypeIn</b> has been set to TYPE_GLYPHHANDLE.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
TYPE_UNICODE

</td>
<td>
The <i>pGlyph</i> array elements are of type WCHAR. This value is valid when <b>dwTypeIn</b> has been set to either TYPE_GLYPHHANDLE or TYPE_GLYPHID.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

Supplied by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563594">UNIFONTOBJ_GetInfo</a> caller.

`pGlyphIn`

Pointer to an array of glyph specifiers. The array element type is indicated by <b>dwTypeIn</b>. This value is supplied by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563594">UNIFONTOBJ_GetInfo</a> caller.

`pGlyphOut`

Caller-supplied pointer to an empty array of glyph specifiers. The array is filled in by Unidrv's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563594">UNIFONTOBJ_GetInfo</a> callback function. The array element type is indicated by <b>dwTypeOut</b>. This pointer is supplied by the <u>UNIFONTOBJ_GetInfo</u> caller.

## Remarks
To convert an array of glyph specifiers from one type to another, a rendering plug-in can supply the address of a GETINFO_GLYPHSTRING structure when calling Unidrv's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563594">UNIFONTOBJ_GetInfo</a> callback function.

If the conversion is from TYPE_GLYPHHANDLE to TYPE_TRANSDATA, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563594">UNIFONTOBJ_GetInfo</a> must be called twice.

<ol>
<li>
Before the first call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563594">UNIFONTOBJ_GetInfo</a>, the rendering plug-in fills in the <b>dwSize</b>, <b>dwCount</b>, <b>dwTypeIn</b>, and <b>pGlyphIn</b> members and sets <b>dwGlyphOutSize</b> member to zero. 

After <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563594">UNIFONTOBJ_GetInfo</a> returns, the <b>dwGlyphOutSize</b> member contains the size, in bytes, of the buffer needed to store the converted string.

</li>
<li>
The plug-in allocates a block of memory of the size received in the <b>dwGlyphOutSize</b> member, sets the <b>pGlyphOut</b> member to point to this memory block, and calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563594">UNIFONTOBJ_GetInfo</a> once more. UNIDRV then converts the string from TYPE_GLYPHHANDLE to TYPE_TRANSDATA.

</li>
</ol>
The values that a rendering plug-in specifies for the <b>dwTypeIn </b>and <b>pGlyphIn</b> members typically are those that were previously received as the <b>dwType </b>and <i>pGlyph</i> parameters to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554267">IPrintOemUni::OutputCharStr</a> method.
