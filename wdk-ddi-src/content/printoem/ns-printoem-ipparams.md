# IPPARAMS structure
The IPPARAMS structure is used as an input parameter to a rendering plug-in's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554261">IPrintOemUni::ImageProcessing</a> method.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct {
  DWORD dwSize;
  POINT ptOffset;
  PSTR  pHalftoneOption;
  BOOL  bBanding;
  BOOL  bBlankBand;
} IPPARAMS, *PIPPARAMS;
````

## Members


`bBanding`

Specifies whether image banding is active. If <b>TRUE</b>, image banding is active. If <b>FALSE</b>, image banding is not active. Supplied by Unidrv.

`bBlankBand`

Specifies whether a blank band was drawn in the source bitmap supplied to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554261">IPrintOemUni::ImageProcessing</a>. A value of <b>TRUE</b> indicates that nothing was drawn in the source bitmap supplied to <b>IPrintOemUni::ImageProcessing</b>. A <b>TRUE</b> value also indicates that data in the source bitmap is invalid and should not be processed. Supplied by Unidrv.

`dwSize`

Specifies the size, in bytes of the IPPARAMS structure. Supplied by Unidrv.

`pHalftoneOption`

Pointer to a string containing the name of the currently selected halftoning option. Supplied by Unidrv.

`ptOffset`

Pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569161">POINT</a> structure containing the banded image's offset from the upper left corner of the drawing area. Supplied by Unidrv.
