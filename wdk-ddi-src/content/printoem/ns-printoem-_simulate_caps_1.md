# _SIMULATE_CAPS_1 structure
The SIMULATE_CAPS_1 structure contains information about the types of simulations a spooler supports.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _SIMULATE_CAPS_1 {
  DWORD dwLevel;
  DWORD dwPageOrderFlags;
  DWORD dwNumberOfCopies;
  DWORD dwCollate;
  DWORD dwNupOptions;
} SIMULATE_CAPS_1, *PSIMULATE_CAPS_1;
````

## Members


`dwCollate`

Specifies whether the spooler supports collation. A value of 1 indicates that the spooler supports collation, and a value of 0 indicates that it does not.

`dwLevel`

Specifies the version of this structure. This value must be 1.

`dwNumberOfCopies`

Specifies the maximum number of copies the spooler can handle.

`dwNupOptions`

Is a bitmask representing the various numbers of document pages the printer can print on a physical page. The least significant bit represents 1 document page per page, the next bit represents 2 document pages per page, the next bit represents 3 document pages per physical page, and so on. For example, 0x0000810B indicates that the spooler supports 1, 2, 4, 9, and 16 document pages per physical page.

`dwPageOrderFlags`

Specifies the order in which pages will be printed. This member can be set to one of the following values:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Definition</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
BOOKLET_PRINT

</td>
<td>
Pages should be printed in booklet form, with two document pages printed on one side of a physical page. In landscape mode, the two document pages are printed side-by-side on the paper. In portrait mode, the two document pages are printed top-and-bottom.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
NORMAL_PRINT

</td>
<td>
Pages should be printed in normal order: page 1, page 2, and so on.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
REVERSE_PRINT

</td>
<td>
Pages should be printed in reverse order: last page, next-to-last page, and so on.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks
The <b>IPrintCoreUI2::QuerySimulationSupport</b> method uses this structure to report the spooler's level of simulation support to a user-interface plug-in.
