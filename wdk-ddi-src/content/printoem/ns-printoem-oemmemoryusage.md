# OEMMEMORYUSAGE structure
The OEMMEMORYUSAGE structure is used as an input parameter to a rendering plug-in's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554264">IPrintOemUni::MemoryUsage</a> method.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct {
  DWORD dwFixedMemoryUsage;
  DWORD dwPercentMemoryUsage;
  DWORD dwMaxBandSize;
} OEMMEMORYUSAGE, *POEMMEMORYUSAGE;
````

## Members


`dwFixedMemoryUsage`

Specifies the amount, in bytes, of fixed-sized memory required by the <b>IPrintOemUni::MemoryUsage</b> method. Supplied by the rendering plug-in.

`dwMaxBandSize`

Specifies the maximum size, in bytes, that can be used for source bitmaps. This is the value that Unidrv uses to subtract from when applying the plug-in supplied values contained in <b>dwFixedMemoryUsage</b> and <b>dwPercentMemoryUsage</b>. Supplied by Unidrv.

`dwPercentMemoryUsage`

Specifies the amount of variably-sized memory required by the <b>IPrintOemUni::MemoryUsage</b> method, expressed as a percentage of the size of the source bitmap received by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554261">IPrintOemUni::ImageProcessing</a>. Supplied by the rendering plug-in.

## Remarks
The Unidrv driver uses the values in the <b>dwFixedMemoryUsage</b> and <b>dwPercentMemoryUsage</b> members of this structure to determine the optimum size for a GDI drawing surface, taking into account any memory requirements of a rendering plug-in's <b>IPrintOemUni::ImageProcessing</b> method. For more information about how these members are used, see the Remarks section in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554264">IPrintOemUni::MemoryUsage</a>.
