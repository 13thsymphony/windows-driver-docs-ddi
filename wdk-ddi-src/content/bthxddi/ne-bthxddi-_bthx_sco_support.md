# _BTHX_SCO_SUPPORT Enumeration
The BTHX_SCO_SUPPORT enumeration lists the different types of SCO supported by the transport driver.

## Syntax
```
typedef enum _BTHX_SCO_SUPPORT {
  ScoSupportNone       ,
  ScoSupportHCI        ,
  ScoSupportHCIBypass
} BTHX_SCO_SUPPORT, *PBTHX_SCO_SUPPORT;
```

## Constants

<table>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>ScoSupportNone</td>
                    <td>SCO is not supported.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>ScoSupportHCI</td>
                    <td>SCO data passes through the HCI layer (stack).</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>ScoSupportHCIBypass</td>
                    <td>SCO data does not pass through the HCI layer but through a sideband mechanism like an I2S channel.</td>
                </tr>
</table>

## Remarks

Upon starting, the Bluetooth stack will query the transport driver for its capabilities by sending the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh450883">IOCTL_BTHX_QUERY_CAPABILITIES</a> IOCTL.

The output buffer of this IOCTL is defined by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh450833">BTHX_CAPABILITIES</a> structure which contains the 
BTHX_SCO_SUPPORT structure.

The transport driver must specify <b>ScoSupportHCIBypass</b>.
