# _BTHX_HCI_PACKET_TYPE Enumeration
The BTHX_HCI_PACKET_TYPE enumeration lists the different types of packets being sent from the Bluetooth stack to the transport driver.

## Syntax
````
typedef enum _BTHX_HCI_PACKET_TYPE { 
  HciPacketCommand  = 0x01,
  HciPacketAclData  = 0x02,
  HciPacketEvent    = 0x04
} BTHX_HCI_PACKET_TYPE;
````

## Constants

<table>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>HciPacketAclData</td>
                    <td>The packet represents ACL data.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>HciPacketCommand</td>
                    <td>The packet represents a command.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>HciPacketEvent</td>
                    <td>The packet represents an event.</td>
                </tr>
</table>

    ## Remarks

        The IOCTL_BTHX_HCI_READ and IOCTL_BTHX_HCI_WRITE IOCTLs are used to read/write data to/from the transport driver. The BTHX_HCI_PACKET_TYPE enumeration is used to specify with which type of packet the read/write is associated.
