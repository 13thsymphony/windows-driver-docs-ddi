# WRITE_PORT_BUFFER_UCHAR function
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>WRITE_PORT_BUFFER_UCHAR</b> function writes a number of bytes from a buffer to the specified port.

## Syntax

````
void WRITE_PORT_BUFFER_UCHAR(
  _In_ IWDFDevice3 *pDevice,
  _In_ PUCHAR      Port,
  _In_ PUCHAR      Buffer,
  _In_ ULONG       Count 
);
````

## Parameters

`pDevice`

Specifies a pointer to the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdfdevice3.md">IWDFDevice3</a> interface for the device object of the device to access.

`Port`

A pointer to the port, which must be a mapped memory range in I/O space.

`Buffer`

A pointer to a buffer from which an array of UCHAR values is to be written.

`Count`

Specifies the number of bytes to be written to the buffer.


## Return Value

This function does not return a value.

## Remarks

The size of the buffer must be large enough to contain at least the specified number of bytes.
