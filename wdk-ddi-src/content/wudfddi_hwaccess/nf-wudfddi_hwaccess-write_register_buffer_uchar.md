# WRITE_REGISTER_BUFFER_UCHAR function



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>WRITE_REGISTER_BUFFER_UCHAR</b> function writes a number of bytes from a buffer to the specified register.



## -syntax

````
void WRITE_REGISTER_BUFFER_UCHAR(
  _In_ IWDFDevice3 *pDevice,
  _In_ PUCHAR      Register,
  _In_ PUCHAR      Buffer,
  _In_ ULONG       Count 
);
````


## -parameters

### -param pDevice [in]

### -param Register [in]

A pointer to the register, which must be a mapped range in memory space.


### -param Buffer [in]

A pointer to a buffer from which an array of UCHAR values is to be written.
