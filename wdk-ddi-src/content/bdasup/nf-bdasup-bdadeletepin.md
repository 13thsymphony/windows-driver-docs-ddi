# BdaDeletePin function
The <b>BdaDeletePin</b> function deletes a pin from the specified filter.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS BdaDeletePin(
  _In_      PKSFILTER pKSFilter,
  _Out_opt_ PULONG    pulPinId
);
````

## Parameters

`pKSFilter`

Points to the filter in which to delete a pin.

`pulPinId`

Points to a variable that contains the identifier for the pin to delete.


## Return Value

Returns STATUS_SUCCESS or an appropriate error code.

## Remarks

A BDA minidriver calls the <a href="..\bdasup\nf-bdasup-bdamethoddeletepin.md">BdaMethodDeletePin</a> function when the network provider dynamically deletes a pin using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563415">KSMETHOD_BDA_DELETE_PIN_FACTORY</a> request of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563404">KSMETHODSETID_BdaDeviceConfiguration</a> method set. If a BDA minidriver must delete a pin without relying on the network provider, the BDA minidriver should call the <b>BdaDeletePin</b> function directly.
