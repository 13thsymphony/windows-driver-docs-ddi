# BdaGetChangeState function
The <b>BdaGetChangeState</b> function returns the current change state of BDA topology.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS BdaGetChangeState(
  _In_      PIRP              Irp,
  _Out_opt_ PBDA_CHANGE_STATE pChangeState
);
````

## Parameters

`pIrp`

TBD

`pChangeState`

Points to a variable that receives the current change state of BDA topology. The BDA change state can be one of the following values from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556518">BDA_CHANGE_STATE</a> enumerated type:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
BDA_CHANGES_COMPLETE

</td>
<td>
BDA topology changes are complete. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
BDA_CHANGES_PENDING

</td>
<td>
BDA topology changes are pending.

</td>
</tr>
</table>


## Return Value

Returns STATUS_SUCCESS or an appropriate error code.

## Remarks

A BDA minidriver calls the <b>BdaGetChangeState</b> function to retrieve the current change state of BDA topology after the minidriver receives a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563417">KSMETHOD_BDA_GET_CHANGE_STATE</a> request of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563403">KSMETHODSETID_BdaChangeSync</a> method set from the network provider. BDA minidrivers define dispatch and filter-automation tables so that those minidrivers either dispatch the <b>BdaGetChangeState</b> function directly or intercept this request using an internal method (<a href="..\ks\nc-ks-pfnkshandler.md">KStrMethodHandler</a>), which then calls the <b>BdaGetChangeState</b> function. For example, BDA minidrivers that intercept this request can obtain a pointer to the BDA filter from the passed IRP so that they can: 
<ol>
<li>
Not only check for pending topology changes but also for pending changes on the filter. 

</li>
<li>
Return the current change state for both BDA topology and the BDA filter. 

</li>
</ol>See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/1c0dace6-b618-4705-bf5d-65457d14c072">Defining Automation Tables</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/1833864a-5759-437c-ba60-0b38602d9e41">Changing BDA Filter Properties</a> for more information.
