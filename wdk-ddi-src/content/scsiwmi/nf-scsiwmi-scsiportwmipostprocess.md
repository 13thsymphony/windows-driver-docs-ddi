# ScsiPortWmiPostProcess function
The <b>ScsiPortWmiPostProcess</b> routine updates a request context for a WMI SRB.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The SCSI port driver and SCSI miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## Syntax

````
VOID ScsiPortWmiPostProcess(
  _In_ PSCSIWMI_REQUEST_CONTEXT RequestContext,
  _In_ UCHAR                    SrbStatus,
  _In_ ULONG                    BufferUsed
);
````

## Parameters

`RequestContext`

A pointer to the request context for this SRB.

`SrbStatus`

Specifies any valid SRB status. If the output buffer passed to the miniport driver was too small to contain all of the data from a request, the miniport driver sets <i>SrbStatus</i> to SRB_STATUS_DATA_OVERRUN.

`BufferUsed`

If <i>SrbStatus</i> indicates success, the miniport driver sets <i>BufferUsed</i> to the number of bytes of data written to the buffer. If <i>SrbStatus</i> is SRB_STATUS_DATA_OVERRUN, the miniport driver sets <i>BufferUsed</i> to the number of bytes required to complete the SRB successfully.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

A miniport driver must call <b>ScsiPortWmiPostProcess</b> after the WMI SRB request has been processed and is ready to be completed.

For synchronous SRBs, <b>ScsiPortWmiPostProcess</b> is called in the callback routine.

For pending SRBs, <b>ScsiPortWmiPostProcess</b> is called after the SRB has been processed, and before it is completed.

If a miniport driver sets <i>SrbStatus</i> to SRB_STATUS_DATA_OVERRUN and sets <i>BufferUsed</i>, successive identical WMI SRBs with an allocated buffer equal to or greater than <i>BufferUsed</i> bytes should succeed. This should be achieved if the driver sets the exact value for <i>BufferUsed</i> that is needed to complete the request when calling <b>ScsiPortWmiPostProcess</b> with <i>SrbStatus</i> equal to SRB_STATUS_DATA_OVERRUN. For a variable-sized output structure, the input data buffer of the SRB should have enough information to determine the exact <i>BufferUsed</i> value. If the input data buffer does not contain enough information, the driver should never fail the same SRB two times with SRB_STATUS_DATA_OVERRUN. Instead, the driver should set SRB_STATUS_DATA_OVERRUN and request the minimum size necessary for the output buffer first, and then set SRB_STATUS_SUCCESS and indicate the failure in the contents of the output buffer.
