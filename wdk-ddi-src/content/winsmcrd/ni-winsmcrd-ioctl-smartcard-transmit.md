# IOCTL_SMARTCARD_TRANSMIT IOCTL



## -description
<p>Transmits data from the client to the detected smart card in ISO7816-4 compliant APDU. These APDUs are interpreted with respect to the PC/SC specification (Section 4.3.7 has more detailed requirements on support for different NFC contactless tag formats). Because the NFP feature shares the same driver with the smartcard, the card should be connected right after the discovery, no explicit connect for the ‘Transmit’ is needed.</p>


## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
<p>Bytes buffer contains a pointer to SCARD_IO_REQUEST structure followed by the data to be transmitted.</p>

### -input-buffer-length

<text></text>

### -output-buffer
<p>Bytes buffer contains the result of the transmission. The buffer points to the SCARD_IO_REQUEST structure immediately followed by the data received.</p>
