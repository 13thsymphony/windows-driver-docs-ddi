# IOCTL_SMARTCARD_TRANSMIT IOCTL
Transmits data from the client to the detected smart card in ISO7816-4 compliant APDU. These APDUs are interpreted with respect to the PC/SC specification (Section 4.3.7 has more detailed requirements on support for different NFC contactless tag formats). Because the NFP feature shares the same driver with the smartcard, the card should be connected right after the discovery, no explicit connect for the ‘Transmit’ is needed.

### Major Code
[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](xref:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control")

### Input Buffer
Bytes buffer contains a pointer to SCARD_IO_REQUEST structure followed by the data to be transmitted.

### Input Buffer Length
<text></text>

### Output Buffer
Bytes buffer contains the result of the transmission. The buffer points to the SCARD_IO_REQUEST structure immediately followed by the data received.

### Output Buffer Length
<text></text>

### Input / Output Buffer
<text></text>

### Input / Output Buffer Length

### Status Block
I/O Status block
<b>Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status</b> is set to <b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b> if the request is successful. Possible error codes are:
