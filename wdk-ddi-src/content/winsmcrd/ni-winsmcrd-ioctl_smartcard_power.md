# IOCTL_SMARTCARD_POWER IOCTL
Windows may require a driver to have this IOCTL to be NOP and return success.

The <b>IOCTL_SMARTCARD_POWER</b> 
   control code  puts the smart card into one of the following power modes:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Power Mode Setting</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCARD_COLD_RESET</td>
<td>Sets virtual power that only affects the IOCTL_SMARTCARD_GET_STATE. No impact on the actual reader power states. Returns SCARD_SPECIFIC in IOCTL_SMARTCARD_GET_STATE if the card is present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCARD_WARM_RESET</td>
<td>Sets virtual power that only affects the IOCTL_SMARTCARD_GET_STATE. No impact on the actual reader power states. Returns SCARD_SPECIFIC in IOCTL_SMARTCARD_GET_STATE if the card is present.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Major Code
[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](xref:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control")

### Input Buffer
(DWORD) that contains the power state to set.

### Input Buffer Length
<text></text>

### Output Buffer
None.

### Output Buffer Length
<text></text>

### Input / Output Buffer
<text></text>

### Input / Output Buffer Length
<text></text>

### Status Block
<b>Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status</b> is set to <b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b> if the request is successful. Possible error codes are:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return Code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>STATUS_NO_MEDIA</td>
<td>This code is returned if no smart card is detected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</td>
<td>This code is returned if the input or output buffer is invalid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>STATUS_DEVICE_POWERED_OFF</td>
<td>This code is returned if the proximity radio control is off.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks
Virtual power is set to TRUE for COLD_RESET and WARM_RESET; otherwise, virtual power is set to FALSE.
