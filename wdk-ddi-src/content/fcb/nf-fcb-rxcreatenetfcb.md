# RxCreateNetFcb function



## -description
<p><b>RxCreateNetFCB</b> allocates, initializes, and inserts a new FCB structure into the in-memory data structures for a V_NET_ROOT that this FCB is being opened on. The structure allocated has space for a SRV_OPEN and an FOBX structure. </p>


## -syntax

````
PFCB RxCreateNetFcb(
  _In_ PRX_CONTEXT     RxContext,
  _In_ PIRP            Irp,
  _In_ PV_NET_ROOT     VNetRoot,
  _In_ PUNICODE_STRING Name
);
````


## -parameters
<dl>

### -param <i>RxContext</i> [in]

<dd>
<p>A pointer to the RX_CONTEXT structure describing a create operation.</p>
</dd>

### -param <i>Irp</i> [in]

<dd>
<p>A pointer to the IRP encapsulated by this RX_CONTEXT structure.</p>
</dd>

### -param <i>VNetRoot</i> [in]

<dd>
<p>A pointer to the V_NET_ROOT structure that this FCB is being opened on.</p>
</dd>

### -param <i>Name</i> [in]

<dd>
<p>The name of the FCB. The V_NET_ROOT may contain a name prefix that is to be prepended here.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

## -returns
<p><b>RxCreateNetFCB</b> returns a pointer to a newly allocated FCB data structure on success or a <b>NULL</b> pointer on failure. </p>

## -remarks
<p>The <b>RxCreateNetFCB</b> routine is not normally called by network mini-redirector drivers directly. RDBSS calls this routine internally when an I/O request packet is received for IRP_MJ_CREATE and an FCB structure needs to be created. This IRP is normally received by RDBSS in response to a user-mode application requesting a file create operation on a network share. It is also possible for another kernel driver to issue such an IRP. </p>

<p>If the FCB to be created is a paging file, <b>RxCreateNetFCB</b> allocates non-paged pool memory when creating the new FCB data structure and sets the following flag on in the FcbState member of the FCB:</p>

<p></p><dl>
<dt><a id="FCB_STATE_PAGING_FILE"></a><a id="fcb_state_paging_file"></a>FCB_STATE_PAGING_FILE</dt>
<dd>
<p>When this value is set, the FCB structure was created for a paging file and the FCB structure was allocated from non-paged pool memory.</p>
</dd>
</dl><p>When this value is set, the FCB structure was created for a paging file and the FCB structure was allocated from non-paged pool memory.</p>

<p>If the FCB to be created is a not a paging file, <b>RxCreateNetFCB</b> allocates paged pool memory when creating the new FCB data structure. </p>

<p>Windows does not currently allow having a paging file on a remote machine.</p>

<p>If the <b>Create.Flags</b> member in the RX_CONTEXT has the RX_CONTEXT_CREATE_FLAG_ADDEDBACKSLASH flag on, the <b>FcbState</b> member of the FCB has the FCB_STATE_ADDEDBACKSLASH flag set on. </p>
