# RxpTrackReference function
<b>RxpTrackReference</b> tracks requests to reference SRV_CALL, NET_ROOT, V_NET_ROOT, FOBX, FCB, and SRV_OPEN structures in checked builds. A log of these reference requests can be accessed by the logging system and WMI.

## Syntax

````
VOID RxpTrackReference(
  _In_ ULONG TraceType,
  _In_ PCSTR FileName,
  _In_ ULONG Line,
  _In_ PVOID pInstance
);
````

## Parameters

`TraceType`

The value that determines which reference request type is tracked. This value can be one of the following macros defined in <i>fcb.h</i>:




#### RDBSS_REF_TRACK_NETFCB

A reference request on an FCB structure.


#### RDBSS_REF_TRACK_NETFOBX

A reference request on an FOBX structure.


#### RDBSS_REF_TRACK_NETROOT

A reference request on a NET_ROOT structure.


#### RDBSS_REF_TRACK_SRVCALL

A reference request on a SRV_CALL structure.


#### RDBSS_REF_TRACK_SRVOPEN

A reference request on a SRV_OPEN structure.


#### RDBSS_REF_TRACK_VNETROOT

A reference request on a V_NET_ROOT structure.

`FileName`

The name of the source file where this routine was called.

`Line`

The line number in the source file where this routine was called.

`Instance`

TBD


## Return Value

<b>RxpTrackReference</b> always returns <b>TRUE</b> on checked builds.

## Remarks

In checked builds, <b>RxpTrackReference</b> is used to track requests to reference SRV_CALL, NET_ROOT, V_NET_ROOT, FOBX, FCB, and SRV_OPEN structures. For retail builds, this function does nothing.

If WMI is enabled, a log of these dereference operations is sent as a WMI event to user-mode WMI components that have requested notification. The deference request is also logged to the RDBSS logging system by calling the <a href="..\rxlog\nf-rxlog-_rxlog.md">_RxLog</a> routine to record an I/O error log entry if logging is enabled. 

Note that this routine does not actually reference the structure passed (increment the reference count on the structure).

A number of macros are defined in <i>fcb.h</i> for debugging that are the preferred way to call this routine. These macros provide a wrapper around the <b>RxReference</b> or <b>RxDereference</b> routines used for file structure management operations on SRV_CALL, NET_ROOT, V_NET_ROOT, FOBX, FCB, and SRV_OPEN structures. These macros first call the corresponding <b>RxpTrackReference</b> routine to log diagnostic information about the request before calling the corresponding <b>RxReference</b> routine.

For retail builds, this function does nothing.
