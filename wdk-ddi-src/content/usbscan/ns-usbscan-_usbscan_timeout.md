# _USBSCAN_TIMEOUT structure
The USBSCAN_TIMEOUT structure stores time-out values for USB bulk IN and bulk OUT operations, and interrupts.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _USBSCAN_TIMEOUT {
  ULONG TimeoutRead;
  ULONG TimeoutWrite;
  ULONG TimeoutEvent;
} USBSCAN_TIMEOUT, *PUSBSCAN_TIMEOUT;
````

## Members


`TimeoutEvent`

Specifies the number of seconds to wait for an interrupt to occur.

`TimeoutRead`

Specifies the number of seconds to wait for a read operation to time out.

`TimeoutWrite`

Specifies the number of seconds to wait for a write operation to time out.

## Remarks
A value of zero means to wait forever for the read or write operation or interrupt.

The USBSCAN_TIMEOUT structure is used as a parameter to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/1d35c087-6672-4fc6-baa1-a886dd9d3878">DeviceIoControl</a>, when the specified I/O control code is <a href="..\usbscan\ni-usbscan-ioctl_set_timeout.md">IOCTL_SET_TIMEOUT</a>.
