# _USBSCAN_PIPE_INFORMATION structure
The USBSCAN_PIPE_INFORMATION structure is used to describe a USB transfer pipe for a still image device. An array of USBSCAN_PIPE_INFORMATION structures is supplied within a <a href="..\usbscan\ns-usbscan-_usbscan_pipe_configuration.md">USBSCAN_PIPE_CONFIGURATION</a> structure.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _USBSCAN_PIPE_INFORMATION {
  USHORT        MaximumPacketSize;
  UCHAR         EndpointAddress;
  UCHAR         Interval;
  RAW_PIPE_TYPE PipeType;
} USBSCAN_PIPE_INFORMATION, *PUSBSCAN_PIPE_INFORMATION;
````

## Members


`EndpointAddress`

The address of the pipe's endpoint. The address is encoded as follows:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Bits</th>
<th>Definition</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
0..3

</td>
<td>
Endpoint number.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
4..6

</td>
<td>
Reserved, set to 0.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
7

</td>
<td>
Direction, ignored for control endpoints:

0 - OUT endpoint

1 - IN endpoint

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

For more information, see the <i>Universal Serial Bus Specification</i>.

`Interval`

Polling interval, in milliseconds, for interrupt pipes. For more information, see the <i>Universal Serial Bus Specification</i>.

`MaximumPacketSize`

Maximum packet size for the transfer pipe.

`PipeType`

A <a href="..\usbscan\ne-usbscan-_raw_pipe_type.md">RAW_PIPE_TYPE</a>-typed value identifying the pipe type.
