# _WDF_PNP_CAPABILITY enumeration



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>WDF_PNP_CAPABILITY</b> enumeration contains values that identify Plug and Play (PnP) capabilities for a device.



## -syntax

````
typedef enum _WDF_PNP_CAPABILITY { 
  WdfPnpCapInvalid            = 0,
  WdfPnpCapLockSupported      = 1,
  WdfPnpCapEjectSupported     = 2,
  WdfPnpCapRemovable          = 3,
  WdfPnpCapDockDevice         = 4,

## -enum-fields

### -field WdfPnpCapInvalid

Indicates whether PnP capabilities of the device are invalid.


### -field WdfPnpCapLockSupported

Indicates whether the device can be locked in its slot to prevent ejection. (Setting this capability disables ejecting a device from its slot and does not disable ejecting media from a device.) 


### -field WdfPnpCapEjectSupported

Indicates whether the device can be ejected from its slot. (Setting this capability enables ejecting a device from its slot and does not enable ejecting media from a device.) 


### -field WdfPnpCapRemovable

Indicates whether the device can be removed while the computer is running. If <b>WdfPnpCapRemovable</b> is set to <b>WdfTrue</b> and <b>WdfPnpCapSurpriseRemovalOk</b> is set to <b>WdfFalse</b>, users should use the system's Unplug or Eject Hardware application. 


### -field WdfPnpCapDockDevice

Indicates whether the device is a docking station. 


### -field WdfPnpCapSurpriseRemovalOk

Indicates whether users can remove the device without using the computer's Unplug or Eject Hardware application.


### -field WdfPnpCapNoDisplayInUI

Indicates whether the device can be hidden (not displayed) in Device Manager.


### -field WdfPnpCapMaximum

Valid enumeration values were exceeded.


## -remarks
A UMDF driver supplies one of the values of <b>WDF_PNP_CAPABILITY</b> to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556974">IWDFDeviceInitialize::GetPnpCapability</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556993">IWDFDeviceInitialize::SetPnpCapability</a> method to identify the PnP capability to retrieve or set status for.
