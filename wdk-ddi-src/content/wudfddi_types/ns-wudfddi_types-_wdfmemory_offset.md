# _WDFMEMORY_OFFSET structure
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]


The <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ns-wudfddi_types-_wdfmemory_offset.md">WDFMEMORY_OFFSET</a> structure describes the location and size of information that is accessed within a memory block.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _WDFMEMORY_OFFSET {
  ULONG_PTR BufferOffset;
  ULONG_PTR BufferLength;
} WDFMEMORY_OFFSET, *PWDFMEMORY_OFFSET;
````

## Members


`BufferLength`

The size, in bytes, of the information that is accessed in the memory block.

`BufferOffset`

The offset, in bytes, into the memory block where information is first accessed.

## Remarks
A UMDF driver supplies a pointer to a <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ns-wudfddi_types-_wdfmemory_offset.md">WDFMEMORY_OFFSET</a> structure to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560145">IWDFMemory::CopyFromMemory</a> method to describe information to copy from a memory block.

## Requirements
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |

| **Header** | wudfddi_types.h (include Wudfddi.h) |
