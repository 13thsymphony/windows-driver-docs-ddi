# _WDF_IO_QUEUE_STATE Enumeration
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]


      The <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ne-wudfddi_types-_wdf_io_queue_state.md">WDF_IO_QUEUE_STATE</a> enumeration contains values that identify the state of an I/O queue.

## Syntax
````
typedef enum _WDF_IO_QUEUE_STATE { 
  WdfIoQueueAcceptRequests    = 0x1,
  WdfIoQueueDispatchRequests  = 0x2,
  WdfIoQueueNoRequests        = 0x4,
  WdfIoQueueDriverNoRequests  = 0x8,
  WdfIoQueuePnpHeld           = 0x10
} WDF_IO_QUEUE_STATE;
````

## Constants

<table>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>WdfIoQueueAcceptRequests</td>
                    <td>If this value is set to 1, the queue accepts requests by automatically forwarding them through the setting of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558946">IWDFIoQueue::ConfigureRequestDispatching</a> method or by manually forwarding each request through a call to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559081">IWDFIoRequest::ForwardToIoQueue</a> method. 

If this value is set to 0, the queue completes any automatically forwarded requests with "status canceled" or fails <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559081">IWDFIoRequest::ForwardToIoQueue</a> with "status busy".</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>WdfIoQueueDispatchRequests</td>
                    <td>If this value is set to 1, the queue automatically presents requests to the driver, unless the queue is a <b>WdfIoQueueDispatchManual</b> type (see <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ne-wudfddi_types-_wdf_io_queue_dispatch_type.md">WDF_IO_QUEUE_DISPATCH_TYPE</a>). 

If this value is set to 0, the queue does not automatically dispatch requests to the driver. The setting of this status does not prevent the driver from calling the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558967">IWDFIoQueue::RetrieveNextRequest</a> method to manually retrieve a request from the queue.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>WdfIoQueueDriverNoRequests</td>
                    <td>If this value is set to 1, there are no requests that the driver currently operates on that it received from the queue.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>WdfIoQueueNoRequests</td>
                    <td>If this value is set to 1, no requests are in the queue, even requests that can be presented to the driver and that can be returned from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558967">IWDFIoQueue::RetrieveNextRequest</a>.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>WdfIoQueuePnpHeld</td>
                    <td>If this value is set to 1, an event from the Plug and Play (PnP) subsystem suspended the queue from processing requests.</td>
                </tr>
