# _WDF_OBJECT_CONTEXT_TYPE_INFO structure
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]

The WDF_OBJECT_CONTEXT_TYPE_INFO structure describes a framework object's driver-defined context memory.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _WDF_OBJECT_CONTEXT_TYPE_INFO {
  ULONG                          Size;
  PCHAR                          ContextName;
  size_t                         ContextSize;
  PCWDF_OBJECT_CONTEXT_TYPE_INFO UniqueType;
  PFN_GET_UNIQUE_CONTEXT_TYPE    EvtDriverGetUniqueContextType;
} WDF_OBJECT_CONTEXT_TYPE_INFO, *PWDF_OBJECT_CONTEXT_TYPE_INFO;
````

## Members


`ContextName`

A quoted string that represents the name of a driver-defined structure that contains an object's context information.

`ContextSize`

The size, in bytes, of the structure that the <b>ContextName</b> member specifies. The framework allocates space for this structure when it creates an object. If the <b>ContextSizeOverride</b> member of the <a href="..\wdfobject\ns-wdfobject-_wdf_object_attributes.md">WDF_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES</a> structure is nonzero, its value overrides the value in the <b>ContextSize</b> member.

`EvtDriverGetUniqueContextType`

For internal use.

`Size`

The size, in bytes, of this structure.

`UniqueType`

For internal use.

## Remarks
For each object instance, the framework allocates context memory with a size that is based on the value of the <b>ContextSize</b> member or the value of the <b>ContextSizeOverride</b> member of the <a href="..\wdfobject\ns-wdfobject-_wdf_object_attributes.md">WDF_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES</a> structure.

To create and initialize a WDF_OBJECT_CONTEXT_TYPE_INFO structure, drivers should use either the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551250">WDF_DECLARE_CONTEXT_TYPE</a> macro or the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551252">WDF_DECLARE_CONTEXT_TYPE_WITH_NAME</a> macro.

To insert a pointer to this structure into a WDF_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES structure, drivers should use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552405">WDF_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES_SET_CONTEXT_TYPE</a> macro.

For more information about using these macros, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/framework-object-context-space">Framework Object Context Space</a>.
