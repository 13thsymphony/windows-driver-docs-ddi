# WdfObjectDelete function
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]

The <b>WdfObjectDelete</b> method deletes a framework object and its child objects.

## Syntax

````
VOID WdfObjectDelete(
  _In_ WDFOBJECT Object
);
````

## Parameters

`Object`

A handle to framework object.


## Return Value

None.

A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.

## Remarks

After a driver calls <b>WdfObjectDelete</b>, the specified object is deleted after its reference count becomes zero.

Drivers cannot call <b>WdfObjectDelete</b> to delete the following framework objects, because the framework always handles deletion of these objects:

Framework child-list objects (WDFCHILDLIST)

Framework device objects  (WDFDEVICE), unless the driver has called <a href="..\wdfcontrol\nf-wdfcontrol-wdfcontroldeviceinitallocate.md">WdfControlDeviceInitAllocate</a> and created a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/using-control-device-objects">control device object</a>, which the driver must sometimes delete

Framework driver objects (WDFDRIVER)

Framework file objects (WDFFILEOBJECT)

Framework interrupt objects (WDFINTERRUPT)

Framework queue objects (WDFQUEUE), if an object represents a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/creating-i-o-queues">default I/O queue</a> or if the driver has called <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdfdeviceconfigurerequestdispatching.md">WdfDeviceConfigureRequestDispatching</a> to set up the queue to receive all I/O requests of a particular type

Framework USB pipe objects (WDFUSBPIPE)

Framework USB interface objects (WDFUSBINTERFACE)

Framework WMI provider objects (WDFWMIPROVIDER)

Resource range list object
(WDFIORESLIST)

Resource list object
(WDFCMRESLIST)

Resource requirements list object
(WDFIORESREQLIST)

See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/799284a5-91c0-47b0-8f20-75a5f8e2284d">Summary of Framework Objects</a> for a complete list of framework objects.

The <b>WdfObjectDelete</b> method can return before the framework has deleted the object and its child objects. The order in which the framework deletes child objects is not predictable.

For more information about <b>WdfObjectDelete</b>, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/33efc3a8-ac46-4626-ba0f-beb1eaa9ee47">Framework Object Life Cycle</a>.

The <b>WdfObjectDelete</b> method must be called at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL. If your driver is deleting a control device object, <b>WdfObjectDelete</b> must be called at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL. Similarly, if your driver is deleting a common buffer, <b>WdfObjectDelete</b> must be called at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL.

The following code example deletes a framework object and its child objects.
