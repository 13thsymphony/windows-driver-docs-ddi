## -struct-fields

### -field Header

An 
     <a href="..\ndischimney\ns-ndischimney-_offload_state_header.md">OFFLOAD_STATE_HEADER</a> structure. NDIS
     sets the 
     <b>Length</b> member of 
     <b>Header</b> to the size, in bytes, of the TCP_OFFLOAD_STATE_CACHED structure. The 
     <b>RecognizedOptions</b> member of 
     <b>Header</b> is reserved.


### -field Flags

A bitmask that can be set to zero or any of the following flags, combined with bitwise OR: 
     




### -field TCP_FLAG_KEEP_ALIVE_ENABLED

The host stack sets this flag to enable the keepalive option on the connection. The host stack
       clears this flag to disable the keepalive option on the connection. For more information about the
       keepalive option, see RFC 1122.


### -field TCP_FLAG_NAGLING_ENABLED

The host stack sets this flag to enable the Nagle algorithm on the connection. The host stack
       clears this flag to disable the Nagle algorithm on the connection. For more information about the
       Nagle algorithm, see RFC 896.


### -field TCP_FLAG_KEEP_ALIVE_RESTART

The host stack sets this flag to cause the offload target to reset its keepalive timer to
       zero.


### -field TCP_FLAG_MAX_RT_RESTART

The host stack sets this flag to cause the offload target to reset the TotalRT variable in the
       TCP delegated state for the connection to zero.


### -field TCP_FLAG_UPDATE_RCV_WND

The host stack sets this flag to indicate that the default receive window size (InitialRcvWnd in
       the TCP_OFFLOAD_STATE_CACHED structure) has changed. If the value of InitialRcvWnd differs from the
       offload target's currrent receive window size (RcvWnd in the TCP_OFFLOAD_STATE_DELEGATED structure),
       the offload target must advertise a new receive window size to the peer.

</dd>
</dl>

### -field InitialRcvWnd

The default receive window (from socket option SO_RCVBUF).


### -field RcvIndicationSize

When non-<b>NULL</b>, the optimum number of data bytes that the offload target should supply in a single
     call to the 
     <a href="..\ndischimney\nc-ndischimney-ndis_tcp_offload_receive_indicate.md">
     NdisTcpOffloadReceiveHandler</a> function. This number, which is typically between tens and hundreds
     of bytes, is a suggestion--not a requirement. The offload target can indicate more or less than 
     <b>RcvIndicationSize</b> data bytes. However, for optimum performance, the offload target should indicate
     
     <b>RcvIndicationSize</b> data bytes. For more information, see 
     <b>
     NdisTcpOffloadReceiveHandler</b>.
     

When <b>NULL</b>, 
     <b>RcvIndicationSize</b> is unspecified. In this case, the offload target should ignore 
     <b>RcvIndicationSize</b> and indicate as much data as possible in calls to the 
     <i>NdisTcpOffloadReceiveHandler</i> function.


### -field KaProbeCount

The number of keepalive probes that the offload target should send to determine whether a TCP
     connection is intact (see RFC 1122).


### -field KaTimeout

This member specifies, in clock ticks, the timeout interval for inactivity before sending a
     keepalive probe (see RFC 1122).


### -field KaInterval

This member specifies, in clock ticks, the timeout after which to retransmit a keepalive frame if
     no response is received to a keepalive probe (see RFC 1122).


### -field MaxRT

This member specifies, in clock ticks, the maximum time that the offload target should spend
     retransmitting a segment. If the value of 
     <b>MaxRT</b> is non-zero, 
     <b>MaxRT</b> overrides 
     <b>TcpMaximumRetransmissions</b> in the 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d8c9fdf9-47aa-4492-b20a-4a53de191d97">
     NDIS_TASK_TCP_CONNECTION_OFFLOAD</a> structure. The default value for is 
     <b>MaxRT</b> is zero, which means that 
     <b>TcpMaximumRetransmissions</b> sets the maximum number of times that the offload target should
     retransmit a segment on a TCP connection. If the value of 
     <b>MaxRT</b> is FFFFFFFF (or -1), there is no limit on the maximum number of retransmissions. When 
     <b>MaxRT</b> is nonzero, the offload target should reset the 
     <b>TotalRT</b> variable in the TCP delegated state for the connection. 
     <b>TotalRT</b> indicates the total time, in clock ticks, that the offload target has spent retransmitting
     the current TCP segment.


### -field FlowLabel

This member marks host-labeled packets for special handling by intervening routers--for example,
     nondefault QoS or "real-time" service (see RFC 2460). This variable is set through a socket option and
     can vary during the lifetime of the TCP connection. This variable is only meaningful if the TCP
     connection is over IPv6.


### -field TtlOrHopLimit

If the TCP connection is over IPv4, then this member specifies the time to live (see RFC 791).
     This variable is set through a socket option and can vary during the lifetime of the TCP connection. 
     

If the TCP connection is over IPv6, then this member specifies the number of routers that the packet
     can pass through (see RFC 2460). This variable is set through a socket option and can vary during the
     lifetime of the TCP connection.


### -field TosOrTrafficClass

If the TCP connection is over IPv4, then this member specifies the type of service for routing a
     packet (see RFC 2474). This variable is set through a socket option and can vary during the lifetime of
     the TCP connection. 
     

If the TCP connection is over IPv6, then this member prioritizes values for packets according to
     traffic types, indicating how willing the sender is to have the packets discarded (see RFC 2460). This
     variable is set through a socket option and can vary during the lifetime of the TCP
     connection.


### -field UserPriority

A 3-bit priority value. If the offload target supports 802.1p packet information, it must insert
     this priority value into the 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/70dedf56-0591-4296-ad29-df3c48d06987">tag header</a> of all packets that it transmits
     on the offloaded TCP connection. If the offload target does not support 802.1p packet information, it
     should ignore 
     <b>UserPriority</b> . For more information about supporting 802.1p packet information, see 
     <a href="netvista.802_1q_and_802_1p_processing_on_an_offloaded_tcp_connection">802.1Q
     and 802.1p Processing on an Offloaded TCP Connection</a>.


## -remarks
Cached variables are owned and maintained by the host stack. An offload target must not change the
    value of a cached variable unless requested to do so by the host stack. If the value of a cached variable
    changes, the host stack requests an update of the variable, which causes NDIS to call the offload
    target's 
    <a href="..\ndischimney\nc-ndischimney-w_update_offload_handler.md">MiniportUpdateOffload</a> function.
    When the host stack terminates the offload of one or more state objects by causing NDIS to call the
    offload target's 
    <a href="..\ndischimney\nc-ndischimney-w_terminate_offload_handler.md">
    MiniportTerminateOffload</a> function, the offload target does not return the value of offloaded
    constant variables to the host stack.

Note that if an offloaded TCP connection's TCP_FLAG_MAX_RT_RESTART flag is set, the offload target
    must:

Reset that connection's delegated KeepaliveProbeCount variable when the host stack updates that
      connection's cached KaProbeCount variable.

Reset that connection's delegated KeepaliveTimeoutDelta variable when the host stack updates that
      connection's cached KaTimeout and/or KaInterval variables.

When passed to an offload target, a TCP_OFFLOAD_STATE_CACHED structure is associated with an 
    <a href="..\ndischimney\ns-ndischimney-_ndis_miniport_offload_block_list.md">
    NDIS_MINIPORT_OFFLOAD_BLOCK_LIST</a> structure, which contains a header that is formatted as an 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566588">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a> structure. The 
    <b>Revision</b> member of the NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER structure, in this case, specifies the revision number of
    the TCP_OFFLOAD_STATE_CACHED structure.
