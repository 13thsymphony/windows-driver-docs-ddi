# ExtRemoteData::GetString method
The <b>GetString</b> method reads a null-terminated string from the target's memory.  The string is located in the beginning of the region represented by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544008">ExtRemoteData</a> object.

## Syntax

```
PSTR  throw() GetString(
  PSTR   Buffer,
  ULONG  BufferChars,
  ULONG  MaxChars,
  bool   MustFit,
  PULONG NeedChars
);
```

## Parameters

`Buffer`

Receives the null-terminated string read from the target.  The type of <i>Buffer</i> must be the same as the type of the string on the target.  If the string is a Unicode string, the type of <i>Buffer</i> must be PWSTR.  If the string is a multibyte string, the type of <i>Buffer</i> must be PSTR.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>   the remainder of the <i>Buffer</i> buffer, after the string, can be overwritten by this method.</div>
<div> </div>

`BufferChars`

Specifies the size, in characters, of the <i>Buffer</i> buffer.

`MaxChars`

Specifies the maximum number of characters to read from the target.

`MustFit`

Specifies what happens if the string is larger than <i>BufferChars</i> characters.  If <i>MustFit</i> is <code>true</code> and the string is larger than <i>BufferChars</i> characters, an <b>ExtRemoteException</b> will be thrown.  If <i>MustFit</i> is <code>false</code> and the string is larger than <i>BufferChars</i> characters, the string will be truncated and null-terminated to fit inside the <i>Buffer</i> buffer.

`NeedChars`




## Return Value

<b>GetString</b> returns the null-terminated string that was read from the target.  This is <i>Buffer</i>.

## Remarks

This method can only be used if the region represented by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544008">ExtRemoteData</a> object is in virtual memory.  It will not work if the region specifies physical memory.
