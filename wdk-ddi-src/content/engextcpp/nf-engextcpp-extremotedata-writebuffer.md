# ExtRemoteData::WriteBuffer method



## -description
The <b>WriteBuffer</b> method writes data to the target's memory.  The data is located in the beginning of the region represented by the <a href="..\engextcpp\nl-engextcpp-extremotedata.md">ExtRemoteData</a> object.  However, the size of the data can be different.



## -syntax

````
ULONG WriteBuffer(
  [in] PVOID Buffer,
  [in] ULONG Bytes,
  [in] bool  MustReadAll
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Buffer [in]

Specifies the data to write to the target.


### -param Bytes [in]

Specifies the number of bytes to write.  The <i>Buffer</i> buffer must be at least this size.


### -param MustReadAll [in]

Specifies what happens if the debugger engine is unable to write all the data to the target.  If <i>MustReadAll</i> is <code>true</code> and the debugger engine is unable to write <i>Bytes</i> bytes to the target, an <b>ExtRemoteException</b> will be thrown.  If <i>MustReadAll</i> is <code>false</code>, no exception will be thrown if the engine is unable to write the requested number of bytes to the target.


## -returns
<b>WriteBuffer</b> returns the number of bytes written to the target from the <i>Buffer</i> buffer.  If <i>MustReadAll</i> is <code>true</code>, the value of <i>Bytes</i> will be returned (unless an exception is thrown).
