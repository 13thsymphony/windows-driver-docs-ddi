# Uninitialize method
The <b>Uninitialize</b> method is called by the engine to uninitialize an EngExtCpp extension library before it is unloaded.

## Syntax

````
virtual void Uninitialize();
````

## Parameters

This function has no parameters.

## Return Value

This method does not return a value.

## Remarks

If this method is defined in the extension library class <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544508">EXT_CLASS</a>, it can be used by the extension library to clean up before it is unloaded.

There may or may not be a debugging session active when this function is called, so you should not assume that the extension can query session information.

## Requirements
