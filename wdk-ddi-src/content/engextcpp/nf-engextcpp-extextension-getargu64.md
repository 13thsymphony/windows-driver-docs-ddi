# GetArgU64 method
The <b>GetArgU64</b> method returns the value of a named expression argument from the command line used to invoke the current extension command.

## Syntax

````
ULONG64 GetArgU64(
  [in] PCSTR Name,
  [in] bool  Required
);
````

## Parameters

`Name`

Specifies the name of the argument.  The command-line description used in <a href="..\engextcpp\nf-engextcpp-ext_command.md">EXT_COMMAND</a> must specify that the type of this argument is expression.

`Required`

Specifies if the argument is required.  If <i>Required</i> is <code>true</code> and the argument was not present on the command line, <b>ExtInvalidArgumentException</b> is called.   You do not need to set this parameter; if it is not set <i>Required</i> defaults to <code>true</code>.


## Return Value

<b>GetArgU64</b> returns the value of the named expression argument.

## Remarks

For an overview of argument parsing in the EngExtCpp extensions framework, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553340">Parsing Extension Arguments</a>.

This method should only be called during the execution of an extension command provided by this class.
