# ExtRemoteTyped::Field method



## -description
The <b>Field</b> method returns the typed data for a member in the typed data that is represented by this object.



## -syntax

````
ExtRemoteTyped Field(
  [in]Â PCSTR Field
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Field [in]

The name of the member whose typed data is requested.  Sub-members can be specified using a dot-separated path (for example, <b>mymember.mysubmember</b>).  Pointers on this dot-separated path will automatically be dereferenced. However, a dot operator (<b>.</b>) should still be used here instead of the usual C pointer dereference operator (<b>-&gt;</b>).


## -returns
<b>Field</b> returns a new <b>ExtRemoteTyped</b> object that represents the typed data for the specified member.
