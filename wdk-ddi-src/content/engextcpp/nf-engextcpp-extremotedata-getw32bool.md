# GetW32Bool method
The <b>GetW32Bool</b> method returns a BOOL version of the <a href="..\engextcpp\nl-engextcpp-extremotedata.md">ExtRemoteData</a> object, which represents the contents of the target's memory.

## Syntax

````
BOOL GetW32Bool();
````

## Parameters

This function has no parameters.

## Return Value

<b>GetW32Bool</b> returns the BOOL version of  the <a href="..\engextcpp\nl-engextcpp-extremotedata.md">ExtRemoteData</a> object.

## Remarks

The size of the memory represented by the <a href="..\engextcpp\nl-engextcpp-extremotedata.md">ExtRemoteData</a> object must be <code>sizeof(BOOL)</code>.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    There are several different types that can be used to represent a Boolean value. BOOL is one of these types.  For the C++ <b>bool</b> type, use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544050">ExtRemoteData::GetStdBool</a>.  For the BOOLEAN type, use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544013">ExtRemoteData::GetBoolean</a>.</div>
