# operator[] method
The <b>operator[]</b> overloaded operator returns the typed data in the specified array element of the typed data represented by this object.

## Syntax

````
ExtRemoteTyped operator[](
  [in] LONG Index
);
````

## Parameters

`Index`

The index of the array element.


## Return Value

The <b>operator[]</b> operator returns a new <b>ExtRemoteTyped</b> object that represents the typed data for the specified element of the array.

## Remarks

If the typed data represented by this object is a pointer and not an array, the pointer is treated like an array.

The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544211">ExtRemoteTyped::ArrayElement</a> performs a similar function.
