  [in] ULONG64 Argument
);
````

## Parameters

## Remarks

If this method is defined in the extension library class <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544508">EXT_CLASS</a>, it can be used to allow the extension library to cache information about the session without the need to register event callbacks.

This method is called at the end of a session.
