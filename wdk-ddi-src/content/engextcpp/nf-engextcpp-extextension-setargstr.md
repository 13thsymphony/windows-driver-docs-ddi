# SetArgStr method
The <b>SetArgStr</b> method sets a named string argument for the current expression command.

## Syntax

````
bool SetArgStr(
  [in] PCSTR Name,
  [in] PCSTR Arg,
  [in] bool  OnlyIfUnset
);
````

## Parameters

`Name`

Specifies the name of the argument.  The command-line description used in <a href="..\engextcpp\nf-engextcpp-ext_command.md">EXT_COMMAND</a> must specify that the type of this argument is string.

`Arg`

A string that specifies the value of the named argument.  A pointer to the first non-space character is saved as the argument.  In this case, <i>Arg</i> must not be <b>NULL</b>.

`OnlyIfUnset`

Specifies what happens if the argument is already set.  If <i>OnlyIfUnset</i> is <code>true</code> and the argument has already been set, the argument will not be changed.  If <i>OnlyIfUnset</i> is <code>false</code> and the argument has already been set, the argument will be changed.


## Return Value

<b>SetArgStr</b> returns <code>true</code> if the argument was changed; <code>false</code> otherwise.

## Remarks

For an overview of argument parsing in the EngExtCpp extensions framework, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553340">Parsing Extension Arguments</a>.

This method should only be called during the execution of an extension command provided by this class.
