# GetLongPtr method
The <b>GetLongPtr</b> method returns a signed integer version (extended to LONG64) of the <a href="..\engextcpp\nl-engextcpp-extremotedata.md">ExtRemoteData</a> object, which represents the contents of the target's memory.  The size of the unsigned integer from the target is the same size as a pointer on the target.

## Syntax

````
LONG64 GetLongPtr();
````

## Parameters

This function has no parameters.

## Return Value

<b>GetLongPtr</b> returns a signed integer version of the <a href="..\engextcpp\nl-engextcpp-extremotedata.md">ExtRemoteData</a> object, extended to LONG64.

## Remarks

The size of the memory represented by the <a href="..\engextcpp\nl-engextcpp-extremotedata.md">ExtRemoteData</a> object must be the same as the size of a pointer on the target, <code>ExtExtension::m_PtrSize</code>.

## Requirements
