# SetArgU64 method
The <b>SetArgU64</b> method sets a named expression argument for the current expression command.

## Syntax

````
bool SetArgU64(
  [in] PCSTR   Name,
  [in] ULONG64 Arg,
  [in] bool    OnlyIfUnset
);
````

## Parameters

`Name`

Specifies the name of the argument.  The command-line description used in <a href="..\engextcpp\nf-engextcpp-ext_command.md">EXT_COMMAND</a> must specify that the type of this argument is expression.

`Arg`

Specifies the value of the named expression argument.

`OnlyIfUnset`

Specifies what happens if the argument is already set.  If <i>OnlyIfUnset</i> is <code>true</code> and the argument has already been set, the argument will not be changed.  If <i>OnlyIfUnset</i> is <code>false</code> and the argument has already been set, the argument will be changed.


## Return Value

<b>SetArgU64</b> returns <code>true</code> if the argument was changed; <code>false</code> otherwise.

## Remarks

For an overview of argument parsing in the EngExtCpp extensions framework, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553340">Parsing Extension Arguments</a>.

This method should only be called during the execution of an extension command provided by this class.
