# OnSessionActive method
The <b>OnSessionActive</b> method is called by the engine to inform the EngExtCpp extension library when the debugging session becomes active.

## Syntax

````
virtual void OnSessionActive(
  [in] ULONG64 Argument
);
````

## Parameters

`Argument`

Set to zero. (Reserved for future use).


## Return Value

This method does not return a value.

## Remarks

The session might not be accessible.

If this method is defined in the extension library class <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544508">EXT_CLASS</a>, it can be used to allow the extension library to cache information about the session without the need to register event callbacks.

This method is called at the beginning of a session and, if a session has already started, after the extension library is initialized.

If a target is suspended, <a href="..\engextcpp\nf-engextcpp-extextension-onsessionaccessible.md">OnSessionAccessible</a> is called instead.

## Requirements
