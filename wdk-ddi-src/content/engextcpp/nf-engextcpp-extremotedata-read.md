# Read method
The <b>Read</b> method reads the contents of the target's memory, represented by the <a href="..\engextcpp\nl-engextcpp-extremotedata.md">ExtRemoteData</a> object, and then caches the data.

## Syntax

````
void Read();
````

## Parameters

This function has no parameters.

## Return Value

This method does not return a value.

## Remarks

When the region of memory is specified either by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544006">ExtRemoteData::ExtRemoteData</a> constructor or by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a335f881-7b6f-4069-87fe-c036867b0c77">ExtRemoteData::Set(Typed)</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/50b4bee4-3a8c-45a1-9a3f-b416aa8a19e5">ExtRemoteData::Set(Offset Bytes)</a> methods, the contents are automatically read from the target and cached.  This method only needs to be called if the memory on the target might have changed.

The data can be retrieved using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544019">ExtRemoteData::GetData</a> or one of the typed "get" methods.
