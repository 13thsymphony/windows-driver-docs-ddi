# GetPtr method
The <b>GetPtr</b> method returns a pointer from the target's memory version of the <a href="..\engextcpp\nl-engextcpp-extremotedata.md">ExtRemoteData</a> object, which represents the contents of the target's memory. The size of the unsigned integer from the target is the same size as a pointer on the target.

## Syntax

````
ULONG64 GetPtr();
````

## Parameters

This function has no parameters.

## Return Value

<b>GetPtr</b> returns a pointer from the target's memory.  As with all pointers, if the target uses 32-bit pointers, it is sign-extended to 64-bits.

## Remarks

The size of the memory represented by the <a href="..\engextcpp\nl-engextcpp-extremotedata.md">ExtRemoteData</a> object must be the same as the size of a pointer on the target, <code>ExtExtension::m_PtrSize</code>.

## Requirements
