# _USAGE_AND_PAGE structure



## -description
The USAGE_AND_PAGE structure specifies the <a href="hid.hid_usages#usage_page#usage_page">usage page</a> and <a href="hid.hid_usages#usage_id#usage_id">usage ID</a> of a HID control.


## -syntax

````
typedef struct _USAGE_AND_PAGE {
  USAGE Usage;
  USAGE UsagePage;
} USAGE_AND_PAGE, *PUSAGE_AND_PAGE;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Usage

Specifies a usage ID within the usage page specified by <b>UsagePage</b>.

### -field UsagePage

Specifies a usage page.

## -remarks
The<b> HidP_IsSameUsageAndPage</b> macro determines if two <a href="hid.hid_usages#extended_usage#extended_usage">extended usages</a>, represented by <b>USAGE_AND_PAGE</b> structures, are equal.


<pre class="syntax">BOOLEAN HidP_IsSameUsageAndPage(
   USAGE_AND_PAGE u1,
   USAGE_AND_PAGE u2
);
</pre>


<i>u1</i>

<b>USAGE_AND_PAGE</b>

Specifies an extended usage

<i>u2</i>

<b>Return Value</b>

<b>BOOLEAN</b>

<b>HidP_IsSameUsageAndPage</b> returns one of the following status values:

<b>TRUE</b>

Usage <i>u1</i> is the same as usage <i>u2</i>.

<b>FALSE</b>

Usage <i>u1</i> is different than usage <i>u2</i>.

As defined by the USB HID standard, an extended usage is a 32-bit unsigned value. The high-order 16 bits specify the <a href="hid.hid_usages#usage_page#usage_page">usage page</a>, and lower-order 16 bits specify the <a href="hid.hid_usages#usage_id#usage_id">usage ID</a>.
