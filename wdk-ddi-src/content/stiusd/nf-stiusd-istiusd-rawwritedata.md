# IStiUSD::RawWriteData method
A still image minidriver's <b>IStiUSD::RawWriteData</b> method writes data to a still image device.

## Syntax

```
HRESULT RawWriteData(
  LPVOID       lpBuffer,
  DWORD        nNumberOfBytes,
  LPOVERLAPPED lpOverlapped
);
```

## Parameters

`lpBuffer`

Caller-supplied pointer to a buffer containing data to be sent to the device.

`nNumberOfBytes`



`lpOverlapped`

Optional, caller-supplied pointer to an OVERLAPPED structure (described in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation).


## Return Value

If the operation succeeds, the method should return S_OK. Otherwise, it should return one of the STIERR-prefixed error codes defined in <i>stierr.h</i>.

## Remarks

A still image minidriver typically implements this method by calling <b>WriteFile</b> (described in the Windows SDK documentation).
