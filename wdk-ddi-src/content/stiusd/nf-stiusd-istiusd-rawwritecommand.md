# IStiUSD::RawWriteCommand method
A still image minidriver's <b>IStiDevice::RawWriteCommand</b> method sends command information to a still image device.

## Syntax

```
HRESULT RawWriteCommand(
  LPVOID       lpBuffer,
  DWORD        nNumberOfBytes,
  LPOVERLAPPED lpOverlapped
);
```

## Parameters

`lpBuffer`

Caller-supplied pointer to a buffer containing data to be sent to the device.

`nNumberOfBytes`

Caller-supplied number of bytes to be written. This is the number of bytes in the buffer pointed to by <i>lpBuffer</i>.

`lpOverlapped`

Optional, caller-supplied pointer to an OVERLAPPED structure (described in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation).


## Return Value

If the operation succeeds, the method should return S_OK. Otherwise, it should return one of the STIERR-prefixed error codes defined in <i>stierr.h</i>.

## Remarks

It is only necessary to call <b>IStiUSD::RawWriteCommand</b> if commands and data are written to a device by different methods. For other devices, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543839">IStiUSD::RawWriteData</a> can be used for both commands and data. If the call is not implemented, it must return STIERR_UNSUPPORTED.

Implementation of this method, along with the meaning of buffer contents, are vendor-defined.
