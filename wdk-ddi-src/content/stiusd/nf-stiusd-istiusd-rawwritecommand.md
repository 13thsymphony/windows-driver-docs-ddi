# IStiUSD::RawWriteCommand method



## -description
A still image minidriver's <b>IStiDevice::RawWriteCommand</b> method sends command information to a still image device.



## -syntax

````
HRESULT RawWriteCommand(
   LPVOID       lpBuffer,
   DWORD        nNumberOfBytes,
   LPOVERLAPPED lpOverlapped
);
````


## -parameters

### -param lpBuffer 

Caller-supplied pointer to a buffer containing data to be sent to the device.


### -param nNumberOfBytes 

Caller-supplied number of bytes to be written. This is the number of bytes in the buffer pointed to by <i>lpBuffer</i>.


### -param lpOverlapped 

Optional, caller-supplied pointer to an OVERLAPPED structure (described in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation).


## -returns
If the operation succeeds, the method should return S_OK. Otherwise, it should return one of the STIERR-prefixed error codes defined in <i>stierr.h</i>.


## -remarks
It is only necessary to call <b>IStiUSD::RawWriteCommand</b> if commands and data are written to a device by different methods. For other devices, <a href="image.istiusd_rawwritedata">IStiUSD::RawWriteData</a> can be used for both commands and data. If the call is not implemented, it must return STIERR_UNSUPPORTED.

Implementation of this method, along with the meaning of buffer contents, are vendor-defined.
