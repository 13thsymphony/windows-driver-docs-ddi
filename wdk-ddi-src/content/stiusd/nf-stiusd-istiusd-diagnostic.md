# IStiUSD::Diagnostic method



## -description
A still image minidriver's <b>IStiUSD::Diagnostic</b> method runs diagnostic tests on a still image device.



## -syntax

````
HRESULT Diagnostic(
   LPSTI_DIAG pBuffer
);
````


## -parameters

### -param pBuffer 

Caller-supplied pointer to an <a href="image.sti_diag">STI_DIAG</a> structure to receive testing status information.


## -returns
If the operation succeeds, the method should return S_OK. Otherwise, it should return one of the STIERR-prefixed error codes defined in <i>stierr.h</i>.


## -remarks
The <b>IStiUSD::Diagnostic</b> method is called when a user clicks on the Scanners and Cameras Control Panel's Test button. The method should execute tests to confirm that the device is fully operational. For a scanner, these tests might include turning the light on and off, and moving the scanning arm. For a camera, they might include execution of built-in diagnostic functions, or manipulation of device settings. The return value should indicate success or failure of the diagnostic tests.
