# IStiUSD::RawReadCommand method
A still image minidriver's <b>IStiUSD::RawReadCommand</b> method reads command information from a still image device.

## Syntax

```
HRESULT RawReadCommand(
  LPVOID       lpBuffer,
  LPDWORD      lpdwNumberOfBytes,
  LPOVERLAPPED lpOverlapped
);
```

## Parameters

`lpBuffer`

Caller-supplied pointer to a buffer to receive data read from the device.

`lpdwNumberOfBytes`

Caller-supplied pointer to a DWORD. The caller loads the DWORD with the number of bytes in the buffer pointed to by <i>lpBuffer</i>. The driver must replace this value with the number of bytes actually read.

`lpOverlapped`

Optional, caller-supplied pointer to an OVERLAPPED structure (described in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation).


## Return Value

If the operation succeeds, the method should return S_OK. Otherwise, it should return one of the STIERR-prefixed error codes defined in <i>stierr.h</i>.

## Remarks

It is only necessary to implement <b>IStiUSD::RawReadCommand</b> if command and data information are read from a device by different methods. For other devices, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543834">IStiUSD::RawReadData</a> can be used for both commands and data. If the call is not implemented, it must return STIERR_UNSUPPORTED.

Implementation of this method, along with the meaning of buffer contents, are vendor-defined.
