The <b>IStiDeviceControl::Release</b> method closes the instance of the COM object that was created when a minidriver client called <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543824">IStiUSD::Initialize</a>.

## Syntax

````

## Parameters

This function has no parameters.

## Return Value

If the operation succeeds, the method returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns one of the STIERR-prefixed error codes defined in <i>Stierr.h</i>.

## Remarks

The <b>IStiDeviceControl::Release</b> method should be called from within the destructor function of a user-mode still image minidriver's <b>IStiUSD</b> interface. (For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/94fdbeba-5b4a-4b66-b381-ec362b6d38c9">Creating a User-Mode Still Image Minidriver</a>.)

A still image minidriver receives an <b>IStiDeviceControl</b> interface pointer as input to its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543824">IStiUSD::Initialize</a> method.
