## Members


`AuthType`

The type of authentication that is used to establish a connection. The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561490">ISCSI_ConnectionStaticInfo WMI Class</a>, which is defined in <i>Mgmt.mof</i>, does specify values for this member; but if your software includes <i>Iscsidsc.h</i>, it can use the <a href="..\iscsidef\ne-iscsidef-piscsi_auth_types.md">ISCSI_AUTH_TYPES</a> enumeration to assign values to this member.

`CID`

The iSCSI connection ID (CID) for this connection instance. The iSCSI protocol uses this value to identify the connection.

`DataIntegrity`

The name of the iSCSI data digest scheme that is associated with this connection session. This member can have the following symbolic constant values, which are defined in <i>Iscsimgt.h</i>.

<table>
<tr>
<th>HeaderIntegrity</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
None

</td>
<td>
The session is not using a data digest. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
crc32c

</td>
<td>
The session is using a 32-bit CRC digest.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`EstimatedThroughput`

The estimated throughput, in bytes per second, of the connection.

`HeaderIntegrity`

The name of the iSCSI header digest scheme that is associated with this connection session. This member can have the following symbolic constant values, which are defined in <i>Iscsimgt.h</i>.

<table>
<tr>
<th>HeaderIntegrity</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
None

</td>
<td>
The session is not using a header digest. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
crc32c

</td>
<td>
The session is using a 32-bit CRC digest.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`LocalAddr`

A <a href="..\iscsidef\ns-iscsidef-_iscsi_ip_address.md">ISCSI_IP_Address</a> structure that holds the IP address of the local network card that the initiator uses to connect to the network.

`LocalPort`

The local port number that this connection instance uses.

`MaxDatagramSize`

The maximum size, in bytes, of the datagram that the transport supports.

`MaxRecvDataSegmentLength`

The maximum data payload size, in bytes, that is supported for command or data PDUs within this connection session.

`Protocol`

The transport protocol that is used to establish this connection instance. For a list of values that you can assign to this member, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561494">ISCSI_CONNECTION_PROTOCOL_TYPE_QUALIFIERS</a>.

`RemoteAddr`

A <a href="..\iscsidef\ns-iscsidef-_iscsi_ip_address.md">ISCSI_IP_Address</a> structure that holds the IP address of the remote network card that this connection instance uses.

`RemotePort`

The remote port number that the initiator used to make the connection.

`Reserved`

Reserved for Microsoft use only. You must set this member to 0.

`State`

The type of connection state. This member can have the following symbolic constant values, which are defined in <i>Iscsimgt.h</i>.

<table>
<tr>
<th>State</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
login

</td>
<td>
The TCP connection has been established, but the target still has not sent a valid logon response with the final bit set. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
full

</td>
<td>
The target has sent a valid logon response with the final bit set, and the connection is in the full feature phase. The initiator can send SCSI commands and data to targets. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
logout

</td>
<td>
The initiator has sent a valid logoff command, but the connection has not yet been closed.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`UniqueConnectionId`

The connection identifier (ID) that the operating system and application software use to uniquely identify the connection. The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561599">LoginToTarget</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550121">AddConnectionToSession</a> methods both return this value in the <i>UniqueConnectionId</i> parameter. Do not confuse this value with the connection ID (CID).
