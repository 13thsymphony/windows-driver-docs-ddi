# _SERIAL_LINE_CONTROL structure
The <b>SERIAL_LINE_CONTROL</b> structure describes the control settings for the serial line.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _SERIAL_LINE_CONTROL {
  UCHAR StopBits;
  UCHAR Parity;
  UCHAR WordLength;
} SERIAL_LINE_CONTROL, *PSERIAL_LINE_CONTROL;
````

## Members


`Parity`

The type of parity checking used for each character that is transmitted or received. This member is set to one of the following values.
<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NO_PARITY</td>
<td>No parity bit is used.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ODD_PARITY</td>
<td>Odd parity is used. The parity bit is 0 if the number of 1s in the character value is odd. Otherwise, the parity bit is 1.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>EVEN_PARITY</td>
<td>Even parity is used. The parity bit is 0 if the number of 1s in the character value is even. Otherwise, the parity bit is 1.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MARK_PARITY</td>
<td>The parity bit is always set to 1.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SPACE_PARITY</td>
<td>The parity bit is always set to 0.</td>
</tr>
</table>

`StopBits`

The number of stop bits used at the end of each character that is transmitted or received. This member is set to one of the following values.
<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>STOP_BIT_1</td>
<td>One stop bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>STOP_BITS_1_5</td>
<td>One and a half stop bits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>STOP_BITS_2</td>
<td>Two stop bits. Not valid if <b>WordLength</b> = 5.</td>
</tr>
</table>

`WordLength`

Data bits per character. This member indicates the number of data bits in each character value that is transmitted or received, and does not include parity bits or stop bits. <b>WordLength</b> values in the range 5 to 8 are typically supported.
