# IOCTL_SERIAL_INTERNAL_RESTORE_SETTINGS IOCTL



## -description

The IOCTL_SERIAL_INTERNAL_RESTORE_SETTINGS request restores the specified operating mode of a serial device. The specified operating mode should be a mode that was returned by an <a href="..\ntddser\ni-ntddser-ioctl_serial_internal_basic_settings.md">IOCTL_SERIAL_INTERNAL_BASIC_SETTINGS</a> request. The operating mode settings should be treated as opaque. Serial does not verify the settings when the settings are restored. Note also that a replacement for Serial might implement a different set of parameters.



The IOCTL_SERIAL_INTERNAL_RESTORE_SETTINGS request restores the specified operating mode of a serial device. The specified operating mode should be a mode that was returned by an <a href="..\ntddser\ni-ntddser-ioctl_serial_internal_basic_settings.md">IOCTL_SERIAL_INTERNAL_BASIC_SETTINGS</a> request. The operating mode settings should be treated as opaque. Serial does not verify the settings when the settings are restored. Note also that a replacement for Serial might implement a different set of parameters.



## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
The <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member of the IRP structure points to a client-allocated SERIAL_BASIC_SETTINGS structure that is used to input operating mode settings. The client should use settings that were returned by an IOCTL_SERIAL_INTERNAL_BASIC_SETTINGS request.


### -input-buffer-length
The <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> member of the IO_STACK_LOCATION structure is set to the size, in bytes, of a SERIAL_BASIC_SETTINGS structure.


### -output-buffer
None.


### -output-buffer-length
None.


### -in-out-buffer

<text></text>

### -inout-buffer-length

<text></text>

### -status-block
I/O Status block
If the request is successful, the <b>Information</b> member is set to the size, in bytes, of SERIAL_BASIC_SETTINGS structure. Otherwise, the <b>Information</b> member is set to zero.

The <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the <a href="serial_device_control_requests.htm#generic_status_values_for_serial_device_control_requests">Generic Status Values for Serial Device Control Requests</a>. If Status is set to STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL, the <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> member of the IO_STACK_LOCATION structure is less than the size, in bytes, of a SERIAL_BASIC_SETTINGS structure.
