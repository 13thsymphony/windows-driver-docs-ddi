# IOCTL_SERIAL_SET_TIMEOUTS IOCTL



## -description
An IOCTL_SERIAL_SET_TIMEOUTS request resets the time-out value that the system-supplied bus driver for parallel ports uses with write requests. The write time-out value is used with SPP and SW_ECP modes. The parallel port bus driver queues a set time-out request on a work queue for the parallel device.

A client uses an <a href="..\ntddser\ni-ntddser-ioctl_serial_get_timeouts.md">IOCTL_SERIAL_GET_TIMEOUTS</a> to obtain the time-out values.



## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
The <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> points to a SERIAL_TIMEOUTS structure that the client allocates to input time-out information. The client sets the <b>WriteTotalTimeoutConstant</b> member to a value in milliseconds.


### -input-buffer-length
The <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> member is set to the size, in bytes, of a SERIAL_TIMEOUTS structure.


### -output-buffer
None.


### -output-buffer-length
None.


### -in-out-buffer

<text></text>

### -inout-buffer-length

<text></text>

### -status-block
I/O Status block
The <b>Information</b> member is set to zero. 

The <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the generic status values returned by device control requests for parallel devices or to one of the following values:



The value of the <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> member is less than the size, in bytes, of a SERIAL_TIMEOUTS structure.

The requested time-out value is less than two seconds.
