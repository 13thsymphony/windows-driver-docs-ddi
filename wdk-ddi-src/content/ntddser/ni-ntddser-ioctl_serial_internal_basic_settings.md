# IOCTL_SERIAL_INTERNAL_BASIC_SETTINGS IOCTL
The IOCTL_SERIAL_INTERNAL_BASIC_SETTINGS request sets a serial device to a basic operating mode. Serial's basic operating mode reads and writes one byte at a time, and does not use handshake flow control or time-outs. The basic operation mode is suitable for use by a driver that uses a subset of the 16550 UART interface. Examples of such drivers include a mouse driver or a graphics pad driver for older hardware that use a 16450 UART.

The IOCTL_SERIAL_INTERNAL_BASIC_SETTINGS request returns the operating mode settings that are in use just before Serial sets the basic operation mode. A client uses an <a href="..\ntddser\ni-ntddser-ioctl_serial_internal_restore_settings.md">IOCTL_SERIAL_INTERNAL_RESTORE_SETTINGS</a> request to restore a previous operating mode. A client should treat the operating mode settings as opaque. Serial does not verify the settings when the settings are restored. Note also that a replacement driver for Serial might implement a different set of basic settings.

### Major Code
[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](xref:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control")

### Input Buffer
None.

### Input Buffer Length
None.

### Output Buffer
The <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> points to a client-allocated SERIAL_BASIC_SETTINGS structure that Serial uses to output the current configuration.

### Output Buffer Length
The <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.OutputBufferLength</b> is set to the size, in bytes, of a SERIAL_BASIC_SETTINGS structure.

### Input / Output Buffer
<text></text>

### Input / Output Buffer Length
<text></text>

### Status Block
If the request is successful, the <b>Information</b> member is set to the size, in bytes, of SERIAL_BASIC_SETTINGS. Otherwise, the <b>Information</b> member is set to zero.

The <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/serports/serial-device-control-requests2">Generic Status Values for Serial Device Control Requests</a>. If <b>Status</b> is set to STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL, the value of <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.OutputLength</b> is less than the size, in bytes, of a SERIAL_BASIC_SETTINGS structure.
