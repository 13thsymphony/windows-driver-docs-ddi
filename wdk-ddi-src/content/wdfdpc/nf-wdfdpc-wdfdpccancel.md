# WdfDpcCancel function



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF only]

The <b>WdfDpcCancel</b> method attempts to cancel the execution of a DPC object's scheduled <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b934a0da-0709-4427-bbf2-8d53f9511cf1">EvtDpcFunc</a> callback function.



## -syntax

````
BOOLEAN WdfDpcCancel(
  _In_ WDFDPC  Dpc,
  _In_ BOOLEAN Wait
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Dpc [in]

A handle to a framework DPC object.


### -param Wait [in]

A Boolean value that, if <b>TRUE</b>, indicates that the <b>WdfDpcCancel</b> method will not return until the DPC object's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b934a0da-0709-4427-bbf2-8d53f9511cf1">EvtDpcFunc</a> callback function is either canceled or finishes executing. If <b>FALSE</b>, the <b>WdfDpcCancel</b> method returns immediately.


## -returns
<b>WdfDpcCancel</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the specified DPC object's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b934a0da-0709-4427-bbf2-8d53f9511cf1">EvtDpcFunc</a> callback function was in the system's DPC queue. The method returns <b>FALSE</b> if the callback function was not in the DPC queue, either because the callback function was executing or because it had finished executing.

A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.




## -remarks
If the specified DPC object's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b934a0da-0709-4427-bbf2-8d53f9511cf1">EvtDpcFunc</a> callback function is in the system's DPC queue, it is removed from the queue. If the <i>EvtDpcFunc</i> function is not in the queue, it is either executing or has finished executing. 

If the <i>Wait</i> parameter is <b>TRUE</b>, <b>WdfDpcCancel</b> must be called at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL. If the <i>Wait</i> parameter is <b>FALSE</b>, <b>WdfDpcCancel</b> can be called at any IRQL.

The following code example cancels the execution of the callback function that is associated with the DPC object that the code example in the <a href="..\wdfdpc\nf-wdfdpc-wdfdpccreate.md">WdfDpcCreate</a> topic created.
