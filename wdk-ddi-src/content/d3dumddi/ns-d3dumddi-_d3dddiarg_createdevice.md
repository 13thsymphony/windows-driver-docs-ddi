## -struct-fields

### -field hDevice

[in/out] A handle to the display device (graphics context). On input to the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_createdevice.md">CreateDevice</a> function, <b>hDevice</b> specifies the handle that the driver should use when it calls back into the Microsoft Direct3D runtime. 

The driver generates a unique handle and passes it back to the Direct3D runtime. On output from the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_createdevice.md">CreateDevice</a> function, <b>hDevice</b> specifies the handle that the Direct3D runtime uses in subsequent driver calls to identify the display device.


### -field Interface

[in] The Direct3D/DirectDraw interface version (for example, 7, 8, or 9) that creates the device. 


### -field Version

[in] A number that the driver can use to identify when the Direct3D/DirectDraw runtime was built. For example, the driver can use the version number to differentiate between a runtime that is released with Windows Vista and a runtime that is released with a subsequent service pack, which might contain a fix that the driver requires. 


### -field pCallbacks

[in] A pointer to a <a href="display.d3dddi_devicecallbacks">D3DDDI_DEVICECALLBACKS</a> structure that contains a table of Direct3D runtime callback functions that the driver can use.


### -field pCommandBuffer

[in] Obsolete. To receive a pointer to the first buffer that the user-mode display driver can use to batch commands, the driver must first call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f3f5d6bc-3bc6-4214-830a-cffff01069cc">pfnCreateContextCb</a> function to create a context for the newly created device.


### -field CommandBufferSize

[in] Obsolete.


### -field pAllocationList

[in] Obsolete. To receive an array of <a href="display.d3dddi_allocationlist">D3DDDI_ALLOCATIONLIST</a> structures for the starting allocation list, the driver must first call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f3f5d6bc-3bc6-4214-830a-cffff01069cc">pfnCreateContextCb</a> function to create a context for the newly created device.


### -field AllocationListSize

[in] Obsolete.


### -field pPatchLocationList

[in] Obsolete. To receive an array of <a href="display.d3dddi_patchlocationlist">D3DDDI_PATCHLOCATIONLIST</a> structures for the starting patch-location list, the driver must first call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f3f5d6bc-3bc6-4214-830a-cffff01069cc">pfnCreateContextCb</a> function to create a context for the newly created device.


### -field PatchLocationListSize

[in] Obsolete.


### -field pDeviceFuncs


      [out] A pointer to a <a href="display.d3dddi_devicefuncs">D3DDDI_DEVICEFUNCS</a> structure that the user-mode display driver fills with a table of its functions. The Direct3D runtime uses these functions to communicate with the user-mode display driver.
     


### -field Flags

[in] A <a href="display.d3dddi_createdeviceflags">D3DDDI_CREATEDEVICEFLAGS</a> structure that identifies how to create the device. 


### -field CommandBuffer

This member is reserved and should be set to zero.

This member is available beginning with Windows 7.
