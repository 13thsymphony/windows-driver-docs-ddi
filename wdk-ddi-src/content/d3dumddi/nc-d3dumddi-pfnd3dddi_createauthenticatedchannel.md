# PFND3DDDI_CREATEAUTHENTICATEDCHANNEL callback function
The <b>CreateAuthenticatedChannel</b> function creates a channel that the Microsoft Direct3D runtime and the driver can use to set and query protections.

## Syntax

```
PFND3DDDI_CREATEAUTHENTICATEDCHANNEL Pfnd3dddiCreateauthenticatedchannel;

HRESULT Pfnd3dddiCreateauthenticatedchannel(
  HANDLE hDevice,
  D3DDDIARG_CREATEAUTHENTICATEDCHANNEL *
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`hDevice`

A handle to the display device (graphics context).

`*`




## Return Value

<b>CreateAuthenticatedChannel</b> returns one of the following values:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The channel is successfully created.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">

<a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_createauthenticatedchannel.md">CreateAuthenticatedChannel</a> could not allocate the required memory for it to complete.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>D3DDDIERR_NOTAVAILABLE</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The driver does not support the channel type that is specified in the <b>ChannelType</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_createauthenicatedchannel.md">D3DDDIARG_CREATEAUTHENTICATEDCHANNEL</a> structure that the <i>pData</i> parameter points to. 

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

The runtime passes the handle to the authenticated channel that the driver returns in the <b>ChannelType</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_createauthenicatedchannel.md">D3DDDIARG_CREATEAUTHENTICATEDCHANNEL</a> structure in all subsequent calls that require the handle. 

The driver must keep track of the display device (<i>hDevice</i>) that was used to create the authenticated channel. The driver should fail all subsequent calls that use this created authenticated channel (for example, the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_authenticatedchannelkeyexchange.md">AuthenticatedChannelKeyExchange</a> function) if the display device that is specified in those calls is different from the display device that was used to create the authenticated channel.

## Requirements
