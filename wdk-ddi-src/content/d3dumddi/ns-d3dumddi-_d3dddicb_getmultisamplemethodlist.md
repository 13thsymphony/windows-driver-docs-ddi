# _D3DDDICB_GETMULTISAMPLEMETHODLIST structure
The D3DDDICB_GETMULTISAMPLEMETHODLIST structure describes parameters to retrieve the list of multiple-sample methods for an allocation.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DDDICB_GETMULTISAMPLEMETHODLIST {
  D3DDDI_VIDEO_PRESENT_SOURCE_ID VidPnSourceId;
  UINT                           Width;
  UINT                           Height;
  D3DDDIFORMAT                   Format;
  D3DDDI_MULTISAMPLINGMETHOD     *pMethodList;
  UINT                           MethodCount;
} D3DDDICB_GETMULTISAMPLEMETHODLIST;
````

## Members


`Format`

[in] A <a href="..\d3dukmdt\ne-d3dukmdt-_d3dddiformat.md">D3DDDIFORMAT</a>-typed value that indicates the pixel format of the allocation.

`Height`

[in] The height of the allocation, in pixels.

`MethodCount`

[in/out] On input, the number of elements that the buffer at <b>pMethodList</b> can hold. On output, this member specifies the required number of elements that the buffer at <b>pMethodList</b> should hold.

`pMethodList`

[out] An array of <a href="..\d3dukmdt\ns-d3dukmdt-_d3dddi_multisamplingmethod.md">D3DDDI_MULTISAMPLINGMETHOD</a> structures that describe the list of multiple-sampling methods that are used for the allocation or <b>NULL</b>.

`VidPnSourceId`

[in] The zero-based identification number of the video present source in a path of a video present network (VidPN) topology that the allocation is on.

`Width`

[in] The width of the allocation, in pixels.

## Remarks
If the runtime returns a non-<b>NULL</b> value in the <b>pMethodList</b> member, the runtime returns a value in the <b>MethodCount</b> member that represents the number of elements that the array can hold. If the runtime returns <b>NULL</b> at <b>pMethodList</b>, the runtime returns a value in <b>MethodCount</b> that represents the size of the array buffer that is required, in number of elements.
