# _DDICONTENTPROTECTIONCAPS structure
The DDICONTENTPROTECTIONCAPS structure describes a specific encryption and decode combination that the driver uses.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DDICONTENTPROTECTIONCAPS {
  GUID CryptoType;
  GUID DecodeProfile;
} DDICONTENTPROTECTIONCAPS;
````

## Members


`CryptoType`

[in] A GUID that indicates the encryption type that the driver uses. The currently defined GUIDs are:





#### D3DCRYPTOTYPE_AES128_CTR

A GUID that indicates the 128-bit AES-CRT block cipher.



#### D3DCRYPTOTYPE_PROPRIETARY

A GUID that indicates a proprietary encryption algorithm. 

A <b>NULL</b> value indicates that no encryption is used.

`DecodeProfile`

[in] A GUID that indicates the DirectX Video Acceleration (DirectX VA) decode profile that the driver uses along with the encryption type, which the <b>CryptoType</b> member specifies. Not all drivers allow all types of encryption. For example, MPEG2 IDCT frequently requires that the private libraries, which the hardware vendor supplies, perform the proprietary encryption. A <b>NULL</b> value indicates that DirectX VA decode profile is not used.

## Remarks
The runtime specifies a pointer to a DDICONTENTPROTECTIONCAPS structure in the <b>pInfo</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_getcaps.md">D3DDDIARG_GETCAPS</a> structure--along with the D3DDDICAPS_GETCONTENTPROTECTIONCAPS value in the <b>Type</b> member of D3DDDIARG_GETCAPS--in a call to the user-mode display driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_getcaps.md">GetCaps</a> function to determine the content-protection capabilities that the driver supports. The driver's <b>GetCaps</b> returns a pointer to a populated D3DCONTENTPROTECTIONCAPS structure in the <b>pData</b> member of D3DDDIARG_GETCAPS that describes the content-protection capabilities that the driver supports. An application calls the <b>IDirect3DDevice9Video::GetContentProtectionCaps</b> method to retrieve these content-protection capabilities. For more information about <b>IDirect3DDevice9Video::GetContentProtectionCaps</b> and D3DCONTENTPROTECTIONCAPS, see the DirectX SDK documentation.

If the runtime specifies NULL_GUID (all zeros) in <b>DecodeProfile</b>, the driver should return the content-protection capabilities that are relevant for when a DirectX VA decode profile is not used. These content-protection capabilities correspond to the content-protection DDI functions that the driver optionally implements. For more information about these optional functions, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/770e0fce-d3b5-4599-8165-eadf3f23f9dc">Content Protection DDI</a>.

If the encryption type that is specified in the <b>CryptoType</b> member is supported by the graphics hardware and the driver, but is not supported by the DirectX VA decode profile that is specified in the <b>DecodeProfile</b> member, the driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_getcaps.md">GetCaps</a> function should return D3DDDIERR_UNSUPPORTEDCRYPTO. If the encryption type that is specified in the <b>CryptoType</b> member is not supported at all, the driver's <b>GetCaps</b> function should return D3DDDIERR_NOTAVAILABLE.

If the runtime specifies NULL_GUID in the <b>CryptoType</b> member, the driver should report a superset of its content-protection capabilities. For example, if encryption type A supports some capabilities and encryption type B supports some other capabilities, the driver should return the cumulative capabilities.
