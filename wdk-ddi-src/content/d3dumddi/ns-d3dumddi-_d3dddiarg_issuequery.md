# _D3DDDIARG_ISSUEQUERY structure
The D3DDDIARG_ISSUEQUERY structure describes how to process a query that was created by the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_createquery.md">CreateQuery</a> function.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DDDIARG_ISSUEQUERY {
  HANDLE                 hQuery;
  D3DDDI_ISSUEQUERYFLAGS Flags;
} D3DDDIARG_ISSUEQUERY;
````

## Members


`hQuery`

[in] The handle to the query that was created by the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_createquery.md">CreateQuery</a> function.

`Flags`

[in] A <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddi_issuequeryflags.md">D3DDDI_ISSUEQUERYFLAGS</a> structure that identifies the type of query to issue. The driver can ignore query requests with <b>Flags</b> set to 0. 

For many query types, start query is never specified (that is, the <b>Begin</b> bit-field flag is never set for many query types). For more information about whether the <b>Begin</b> bit-field flag is set for a query type, see the <b>QueryType</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_createquery.md">D3DDDIARG_CREATEQUERY</a> structure.
