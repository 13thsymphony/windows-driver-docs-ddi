# _D3DDDIARG_SETCONVOLUTIONKERNELMONO structure



## -description
The D3DDDIARG_SETCONVOLUTIONKERNELMONO structure describes parameters for setting the monochrome convolution kernel. 



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _D3DDDIARG_SETCONVOLUTIONKERNELMONO {
  UINT  Width;
  UINT  Height;
  FLOAT *pKernelRow;
  FLOAT *pKernelCol;
} D3DDDIARG_SETCONVOLUTIONKERNELMONO;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Width

[in] The width, which is the resolution of the filter kernel in the horizontal direction. Valid values for this member are from 1 to 7. 


### -field Height

[in] The height, which is the resolution of the filter kernel in the vertical direction. Valid values for this member are from 1 to 7. 


### -field pKernelRow

[in] A pointer to weights in the horizontal direction of a separable filter. In Microsoft Direct3D 9.L and later, <b>pKernelRow</b> must be <b>NULL</b>, which indicates that all of the weights are 1.0. 


### -field pKernelCol

[in] A pointer to weights in the vertical direction of a separable filter. In Direct3D 9.L and later, <b>pKernelCol</b> must be <b>NULL</b>, which indicates that all of the weights are 1.0.
