# _D3DDDIARG_CREATECRYPTOSESSION structure



## -description
The D3DDDIARG_CREATECRYPTOSESSION structure describes an encryption session to create. 



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _D3DDDIARG_CREATECRYPTOSESSION {
  GUID   CryptoType;
  GUID   DecodeProfile;
  HANDLE hCryptoSession;
} D3DDDIARG_CREATECRYPTOSESSION;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field CryptoType

[in] A GUID that indicates the encryption type, which the driver uses for the encryption session that the driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_createcryptosession.md">CreateCryptoSession</a> function creates. The GUID can be one of the following:




### -field D3DCRYPTOTYPE_AES128_CTR

A GUID that indicates the 128 bit AES-CRT block cipher.


### -field D3DCRYPTOTYPE_PROPRIETARY

A GUID that indicates a proprietary encryption algorithm. 

</dd>
</dl>

### -field DecodeProfile

 [in] A GUID that indicates the DirectX Video Acceleration (DirectX VA) decode profile that the driver uses for the encryption session that the driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_createcryptosession.md">CreateCryptoSession</a> function creates. The driver uses this decode profile in conjunction with the encryption type that the <b>CryptoType</b> member specifies. 


### -field hCryptoSession

[in/out] A handle to the encryption session. The user-mode display driver must set this handle to a value that the Microsoft Direct3D runtime can use to identify the encryption session in subsequent calls.
