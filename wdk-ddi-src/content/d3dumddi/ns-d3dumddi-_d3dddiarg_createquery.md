# _D3DDDIARG_CREATEQUERY structure
The D3DDDIARG_CREATEQUERY structure identifies a query to create.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DDDIARG_CREATEQUERY {
  D3DDDIQUERYTYPE QueryType;
  HANDLE          hQuery;
} D3DDDIARG_CREATEQUERY;
````

## Members


`hQuery`

[out] A handle to the query. The user-mode display driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_createquery.md">CreateQuery</a> function returns this handle to the Microsoft Direct3D runtime.

`QueryType`

[in] A D3DDDIQUERYTYPE-typed value that indicates the query type to create resources for. This member can be one of the following values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DDDIQUERYTYPE_VCACHE

</td>
<td>
Query at issue end for driver hints about data layout for vertex caching. This query is processed through a call to the driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_issuequery.md">IssueQuery</a> function in which the <b>End</b> bit-field flag is set in the <b>Flags</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_issuequery.md">D3DDDIARG_ISSUEQUERY</a> structure.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DDDIQUERYTYPE_EVENT

</td>
<td>
Query at issue end for asynchronous events that have occurred.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DDDIQUERYTYPE_OCCLUSION

</td>
<td>
Query for the number of pixels that pass z-testing. These pixels are for primitives that are drawn between an issue begin and an issue end. 

This query is processed between calls to the driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_issuequery.md">IssueQuery</a> function in which first the <b>Begin</b> bit-field flag is set in the <b>Flags</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_issuequery.md">D3DDDIARG_ISSUEQUERY</a> structure and next the <b>End</b> bit-field flag is set.

This query enables an application to check the occlusion result against 0. A value of 0 is "fully occluded," which means the pixels are not visible from the current camera position.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DDDIQUERYTYPE_TIMESTAMP

</td>
<td>
Query at issue end for the 64-bit timestamp.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DDDIQUERYTYPE_TIMESTAMPDISJOINT

</td>
<td>
This query is used to notify an application whether the counter frequency has changed from the value that is returned from the D3DQUERYTYPE_TIMESTAMP query.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DDDIQUERYTYPE_TIMESTAMPFREQ

</td>
<td>
This query result is <b>TRUE</b> if the values from D3DQUERYTYPE_TIMESTAMP queries cannot be guaranteed to be continuous throughout the duration of the D3DQUERYTYPE_TIMESTAMPDISJOINT query. Otherwise, the query result is <b>FALSE</b>.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DDDIQUERYTYPE_PIPELINETIMINGS

</td>
<td>
Query for the percent of processing time spent on pipeline data.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DDDIQUERYTYPE_INTERFACETIMINGS

</td>
<td>
Query for the percent of processing time spent on data in the driver.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DDDIQUERYTYPE_VERTEXTIMINGS

</td>
<td>
Query for the percent of processing time spent on vertex shader data.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DDDIQUERYTYPE_PIXELTIMINGS

</td>
<td>
Query for the percent of processing time spent on pixel shader data.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DDDIQUERYTYPE_BANDWIDTHTIMINGS

</td>
<td>
Query for throughput measurements for help in understanding the performance of an application.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DDDIQUERYTYPE_CACHEUTILIZATION

</td>
<td>
Query for the cache hit-rate performance for textures and indexed vertices.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

  
  
  
     D3DDDIQUERYTYPE_COUNTER_DEVICE_DEPENDENT

</td>
<td>
Query for device-dependent counters.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks
The Direct3D runtime uses the handle that is specified by the <b>hQuery</b> member when the runtime calls:

<ul>
<li>
The <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_issuequery.md">IssueQuery</a> function to process a query.

</li>
<li>
The <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_getquerydata.md">GetQueryData</a> function to retrieve information about the query.

</li>
<li>
The <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_destroyquery.md">DestroyQuery</a> function to destroy the handle.

</li>
</ul>
