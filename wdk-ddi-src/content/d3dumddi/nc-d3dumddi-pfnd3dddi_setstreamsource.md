# PFND3DDDI_SETSTREAMSOURCE callback function
The <i>SetStreamSource</i> function binds a portion of a vertex stream source to a vertex buffer.

## Syntax

```
PFND3DDDI_SETSTREAMSOURCE Pfnd3dddiSetstreamsource;

HRESULT Pfnd3dddiSetstreamsource(
  HANDLE hDevice,
  CONST D3DDDIARG_SETSTREAMSOURCE *
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`hDevice`

A handle to the display device (graphics context).

`*`




## Return Value

<i>SetStreamSource</i> returns S_OK or an appropriate error result if the portion of the vertex stream source is not successfully bound.

## Remarks

The Microsoft Direct3D runtime calls the user-mode display driver's <i>SetStreamSource</i> function to store vertex data of multiple vertex formats in a single vertex data stream. The runtime notifies the driver of where vertex data of a particular format is located in the vertex data stream by supplying the stream offset, in bytes, to the beginning of that vertex data.
