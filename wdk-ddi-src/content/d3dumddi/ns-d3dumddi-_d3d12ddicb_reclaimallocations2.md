[in]  The number of items in <b>pDiscarded</b> and whichever of <b>pResources</b> or <b>HandleList</b> is non-NULL.


### -field pResources

[in]  An array of Direct3D runtime resource handles.


### -field HandleList

[in]  An array of allocation handles. If non-NULL, <b>pResources</b> must be NULL.


### -field pDiscarded

[out] Optional array of boolean values specifying whether each resource or allocation was discarded.


### -field PagingFenceValue

[out] The paging fence to synchronize against before submitting work to the GPU which
                                                                           references any of the resources or allocations in the provided arrays
