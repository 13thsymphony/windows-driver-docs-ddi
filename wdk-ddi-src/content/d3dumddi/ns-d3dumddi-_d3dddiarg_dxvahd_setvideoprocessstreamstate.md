# _D3DDDIARG_DXVAHD_SETVIDEOPROCESSSTREAMSTATE structure
The D3DDDIARG_DXVAHD_SETVIDEOPROCESSSTREAMSTATE structure describes the stream state of the video processor to change and the data that is used to change the state.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DDDIARG_DXVAHD_SETVIDEOPROCESSSTREAMSTATE {
  HANDLE                 hVideoProcessor;
  UINT                   StreamNumber;
  DXVAHDDDI_STREAM_STATE State;
  UINT                   DataSize;
  const VOID             *pData;
} D3DDDIARG_DXVAHD_SETVIDEOPROCESSSTREAMSTATE;
````

## Members


`DataSize`

[in] The size, in bytes, of the data that is used to change the stream state.

`hVideoProcessor`

[in] A handle to the video processor whose stream state is changed.

`pData`

[in] A pointer to the data that is used to change the stream state. For more information about the types of data that <b>pData</b> can point to, see the values of the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ne-d3dumddi-_dxvahdddi_stream_state.md">DXVAHDDDI_STREAM_STATE</a> enumeration.

`State`

[in] A <a href="..\d3dumddi\ne-d3dumddi-_dxvahdddi_stream_state.md">DXVAHDDDI_STREAM_STATE</a>-typed value that indicates the stream state to modify.

`StreamNumber`

[in] A zero-based stream index number. This number must be less than the number that the driver set in the <b>MaxStreamStates</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_dxvahdddi_vpdevcaps.md">DXVAHDDDI_VPDEVCAPS</a> structure.
