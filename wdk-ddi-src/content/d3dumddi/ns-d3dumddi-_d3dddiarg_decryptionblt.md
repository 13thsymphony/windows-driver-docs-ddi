# _D3DDDIARG_DECRYPTIONBLT structure
The D3DDDIARG_DECRYPTIONBLT structure describes the parameters of an decrypted bit-block transfer (bitblt) in a call to the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_decryptionblt.md">DecryptionBlt</a> function.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DDDIARG_DECRYPTIONBLT {
  HANDLE                     hCryptoSession;
  HANDLE                     hSrcResource;
  UINT                       SrcSubResourceIndex;
  HANDLE                     hDstResource;
  UINT                       DstSubResourceIndex;
  UINT                       SrcResourceSize;
  D3DDDIENCRYPTED_BLOCK_INFO *pEncryptedBlockInfo;
  VOID                       *pContentKey;
  VOID                       *pIV;
} D3DDDIARG_DECRYPTIONBLT;
````

## Members


`DstSubResourceIndex`

[in] The index to the destination surface within the resource.

`hCryptoSession`

[in] A handle to the encryption session.

`hDstResource`

[in] A handle to the destination resource.

`hSrcResource`

[in] A handle to the source resource.

`pContentKey`

[in] A pointer to a block of memory that contains the content key that is required to decrypt the bitblt data. If <b>pContentKey</b> is <b>NULL</b>, hardware does not require a separate content key to decrypt the data. That is, the session key is used to encrypt the data.

`pEncryptedBlockInfo`

[in] A pointer to a <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiencrypted_block_info.md">D3DDDIENCRYPTED_BLOCK_INFO</a> structure that describes the portions of the buffer that are encrypted.

`pIV`

[in] A pointer to a block of memory that contains the initialization vector that is required to decrypt the bitblt data. If <b>pIV</b> is <b>NULL</b>, hardware does not require a separate initialization vector to decrypt the data. That is, the session key is used to encrypt the data.

`SrcResourceSize`

[in] The size, in bytes, of the source resource.

`SrcSubResourceIndex`

[in] The index to the source surface within the resource.

## Remarks
A pointer to a populated D3DDDIARG_DECRYPTIONBLT structure is passed to the driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_decryptionblt.md">DecryptionBlt</a> function to write data to a protected surface.

## Requirements
