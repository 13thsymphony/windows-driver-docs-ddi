# PFND3DDDI_SETPRIORITY callback



## -description
The <i>SetPriority</i> function sets the eviction-from-memory priority for a managed texture.



## -prototype

````
PFND3DDDI_SETPRIORITY SetPriority;

__checkReturn HRESULT APIENTRY SetPriority(
  _In_       HANDLE                hDevice,
  _In_ const D3DDDIARG_SETPRIORITY *pData
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hDevice [in]

A handle to the display device (graphics context).


### -param pData [in]

A pointer to a <a href="display.d3dddiarg_setpriority">D3DDDIARG_SETPRIORITY</a> structure that specifies the priority level to set for the managed texture.


## -returns
<i>SetPriority</i> returns one of the following values:
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The priority level is successfully set.
<dl>
<dt><b>E_INVALIDARG</b></dt>
</dl>Parameters were validated and determined to be incorrect.

 


## -remarks
The Microsoft Direct3D runtime calls <i>SetPriority</i> to set the priority level for a resource. The user-mode display driver should translate the resource handle that is supplied in the <b>hResource</b> member of the <a href="display.d3dddiarg_setpriority">D3DDDIARG_SETPRIORITY</a> structure that is pointed to by <i>pData</i> to an allocation handle. After the driver makes this translation, the driver should pass the resulting handle in a call to the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_setprioritycb.md">pfnSetPriorityCb</a> function.
