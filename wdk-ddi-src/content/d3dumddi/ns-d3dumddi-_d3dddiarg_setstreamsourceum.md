# _D3DDDIARG_SETSTREAMSOURCEUM structure
The D3DDDIARG_SETSTREAMSOURCEUM structure describes the vertex stream to bind to a user-memory buffer.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DDDIARG_SETSTREAMSOURCEUM {
  UINT Stream;
  UINT Stride;
} D3DDDIARG_SETSTREAMSOURCEUM;
````

## Members


`Stream`

[in] The index, starting from zero, for the vertex stream to bind to a user-memory buffer.

`Stride`

[in] The size, in bytes, from one vertex to the next vertex in the stream. In contrast to the call to the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_setstreamsource.md">SetStreamSource</a> function, <b>Stride</b> cannot be set to zero. Because only one stream can be bound to a user memory buffer, each vertex in the stream must receive different data for processing.

The <b>Stride</b> value must be DWORD-aligned.

## Remarks
In a call to the user-mode display driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_setstreamsourceum.md">SetStreamSourceUM</a> function, a pointer to a D3DDDIARG_SETSTREAMSOURCEUM structure is passed in the <i>pData</i> parameter. The Microsoft Direct3D runtime supplies vertex data for the vertex stream through the <i>pUMBuffer</i> parameter in a call to the user-mode display driver's <b>SetStreamSourceUM</b> function.

## Requirements

| **Windows version** | Available in Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating systems. Available in Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating systems. |
