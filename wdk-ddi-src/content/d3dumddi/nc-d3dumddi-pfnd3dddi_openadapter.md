# PFND3DDDI_OPENADAPTER callback function
The <i>OpenAdapter</i> function creates a graphics adapter object that is referenced in subsequent calls.

## Syntax

```
PFND3DDDI_OPENADAPTER Pfnd3dddiOpenadapter;

HRESULT Pfnd3dddiOpenadapter(
  D3DDDIARG_OPENADAPTER *
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`*`




## Return Value

<i>OpenAdapter</i> returns one of the following values:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The graphics adapter object is successfully created.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
<i>OpenAdapter</i> could not allocate the required memory for it to complete.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

The graphics adapter object that is created by <i>OpenAdapter</i> represents the underlying graphics hardware. Before the Microsoft Direct3D runtime can create a display device by calling <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_createdevice.md">CreateDevice</a>, the user-mode display driver should call the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_queryadapterinfocb.md">pfnQueryAdapterInfoCb</a> function to query for the graphics hardware capabilities from the display miniport driver. 

The Direct3D runtime can open multiple graphics adapter objects from a single graphics adapter.

## Requirements
