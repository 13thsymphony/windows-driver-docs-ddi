# PFND3DDDI_UNLOCKASYNC callback function
The <i>UnlockAsync</i> function unlocks a resource or a surface within the resource that the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_lockasync.md">LockAsync</a> function previously locked.

## Syntax

```
PFND3DDDI_UNLOCKASYNC Pfnd3dddiUnlockasync;

HRESULT Pfnd3dddiUnlockasync(
  HANDLE hDevice,
  CONST D3DDDIARG_UNLOCKASYNC *
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`hDevice`

A handle to a display device (that is, the graphics context).

`*`




## Return Value

<i>UnlockAsync</i> returns one of the following values:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The resource is successfully unlocked.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
<i>UnlockAsync</i> could not allocate the required memory for it to complete.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_INVALIDARG</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The resource that <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_unlockasync.md">D3DDDIARG_UNLOCKASYNC</a> describes was not locked by a previous call to the driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_lockasync.md">LockAsync</a> function. 

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

A user-mode display driver should call the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_unlockcb.md">pfnUnlockCb</a> function with the appropriate allocation handle after the <i>UnlockAsync</i> function is called. 

A user-mode display driver optionally implements <i>UnlockAsync</i>; the Microsoft Direct3D runtime calls <i>UnlockAsync</i> only if the driver implements the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_lockasync.md">LockAsync</a>, <i>UnlockAsync</i>, and <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_rename.md">Rename</a> functions. 

Like <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_lockasync.md">LockAsync</a>, <i>UnlockAsync</i> is called on the main application thread while most other calls to the user-mode display driver functions are made on a worker thread (on multiple-processor computers). 

If a user-mode display driver exposes a DDI version of 0x0000000B or greater (the driver returns this value in the <b>DriverVersion</b> member of the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\ns-d3d10umddi-d3d10ddiarg_openadapter.md">D3D10DDIARG_OPENADAPTER</a> structure in a call to the driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_openadapter.md">OpenAdapter</a> function), the Direct3D runtime will call <i>UnlockAsync</i> in a reentrant manner. When the runtime calls <i>UnlockAsync</i> in a reentrant manner, one thread can execute inside <i>UnlockAsync</i> while another thread that references the same display device executes inside of another user-mode display driver function.
