# _D3DDDIARG_SETPALETTE structure
The D3DDDIARG_SETPALETTE structure describes how to associate a palette with a texture.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DDDIARG_SETPALETTE {
  UINT   PaletteHandle;
  UINT   PaletteFlags;
  HANDLE hResource;
} D3DDDIARG_SETPALETTE;
````

## Members


`hResource`

[in] A handle to the surface (texture) with which the palette that is identified by <b>PaletteHandle</b> is associated.

`PaletteFlags`

[in] A valid bitwise OR of the following flags that specify the attributes of the palette.
<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DDDISETPALETTE_256 (0x00000001)

</td>
<td>
The palette has 256 entries.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DDDISETPALETTE_ALLOW256 (0x00000200)

</td>
<td>
The palette can be fully updated.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DDDISETPALETTE_ALPHA (0x00002000)

</td>
<td>
The palette's alpha data channel is valid and should be used.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`PaletteHandle`

[in] A handle to the palette to be set up. If the value of <b>PaletteHandle</b> is zero, the surface that is specified by <b>hResource</b> should be uncoupled from any palette that it might have been associated with previously.

## Remarks
The user-mode display driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_setpalette.md">SetPalette</a> function associates the palette that is specified by the <b>PaletteHandle</b> member with the surface that is specified by the <b>hResource</b> member and uses the <b>PaletteFlags</b> member to specify the characteristics of the palette.
