# _D3DDDIARG_DRAWTRIPATCH structure
The D3DDDIARG_DRAWTRIPATCH structure describes a triangular patch to draw.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DDDIARG_DRAWTRIPATCH {
  UINT Handle;
} D3DDDIARG_DRAWTRIPATCH;
````

## Members


`Handle`

[in] The handle to the patch surface.

## Remarks
The <b>Handle</b> member refers to the patch surface, so that the next time the patch surface is drawn, the Microsoft Direct3D runtime is not required to re-specify the D3DTRIPATCH_INFO data structure for the patch surface. The user-mode display driver can precompute and cache forward-difference coefficients and any other information, which allows subsequent calls to the driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_drawtripatch.md">DrawTriPatch</a> function that use the same handle to run more efficiently.

## Requirements
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows version** | Available in Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating systems. Available in Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating systems. |
