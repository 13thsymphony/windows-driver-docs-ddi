# PFND3DDDI_DELETEVERTEXSHADERFUNC callback function
The <b>DeleteVertexShaderFunc</b> function cleans up driver-side resources that are associated with vertex shader code.

## Syntax

```
PFND3DDDI_DELETEVERTEXSHADERFUNC Pfnd3dddiDeletevertexshaderfunc;

HRESULT Pfnd3dddiDeletevertexshaderfunc(
  HANDLE hDevice,
   HANDLE
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`hDevice`

A handle to the display device (graphics context).

`HANDLE`




## Return Value

<b>DeleteVertexShaderFunc</b> returns S_OK or an appropriate error result if the vertex shader code object is not successfully cleaned up.

## Remarks

The <b>DeleteVertexShaderFunc</b> function notifies the driver about the deletion of the vertex shader code object that the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_createvertexshaderfunc.md">CreateVertexShaderFunc</a> function created. The driver can then clean up any driver-side resources that are associated with the vertex shader code.
