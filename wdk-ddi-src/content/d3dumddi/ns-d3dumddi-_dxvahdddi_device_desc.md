# _DXVAHDDDI_DEVICE_DESC structure
The DXVAHDDDI_DEVICE_DESC structure describes a decode device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DXVAHDDDI_DEVICE_DESC {
  DXVAHDDDI_CONTENT_DESC *pContentDesc;
  DXVAHDDDI_DEVICE_USAGE Usage;
} DXVAHDDDI_DEVICE_DESC;
````

## Members


`pContentDesc`

[in] A pointer to a <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_dxvahdddi_content_desc.md">DXVAHDDDI_CONTENT_DESC</a> structure that describes how the device decodes content.

`Usage`

[in] A <a href="..\d3dumddi\ne-d3dumddi-_dxvahdddi_device_usage.md">DXVAHDDDI_DEVICE_USAGE</a>-typed value that indicates how the decode device plays video.

## Remarks
The driver considers the value in the <b>Usage</b> member and the information to which <b>pContentDesc</b> points to optimize its capabilities.

## Requirements
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows Driver kit version** |  |
| **Minimum KMDF version** |  |
