# _D3DDDIARG_GETPITCH structure
The D3DDDIARG_GETPITCH structure describes an encrypted surface for which the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_getpitch.md">GetPitch</a> function retrieves the pitch.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DDDIARG_GETPITCH {
  HANDLE hCryptoSession;
  HANDLE hResource;
  UINT   SubResourceIndex;
  UINT   Pitch;
} D3DDDIARG_GETPITCH;
````

## Members


`hCryptoSession`

[in] A handle to the encryption session.

`hResource`

[in] A handle to the resource.

`Pitch`

[out] The pitch, in bytes, of the encrypted surface. The user-mode display driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_getpitch.md">GetPitch</a> function returns this pitch value to the Direct3D runtime.

`SubResourceIndex`

[in] The zero-based index into the resource, which the <b>hResource</b> handle specifies. This index indicates the encrypted surface.
