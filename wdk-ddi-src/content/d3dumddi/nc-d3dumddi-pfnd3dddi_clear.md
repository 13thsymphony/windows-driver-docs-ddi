# PFND3DDDI_CLEAR callback function
The <b>Clear</b> function performs hardware-assisted clearing on the rendering target, depth buffer, or stencil buffer.

## Syntax

```
PFND3DDDI_CLEAR Pfnd3dddiClear;

HRESULT Pfnd3dddiClear(
  HANDLE hDevice,
  CONST D3DDDIARG_CLEAR *,
   UINT,
  CONST RECT *
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`hDevice`

A handle to the display device (graphics context).

`*`



`UINT`



`*`




## Return Value

<b>Clear</b> returns S_OK or an appropriate error result if the hardware-assisted clearing operation is not successfully performed.

## Remarks

How the driver performs the clear operation depends on the number of rectangular areas that are specified in the <i>NumRect</i> parameter and the values that are set in the <b>Flags</b> member of <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_clear.md">D3DDDIARG_CLEAR</a>. The D3DCLEAR_TARGET, D3DCLEAR_STENCIL, and D3DCLEAR_ZBUFFER values (defined in <i>D3d8types.h</i>) indicate the type of buffer to clear. The D3DCLEAR_COMPUTERECTS value (defined in <i>D3dhal.h</i>) indicates how to clear the buffer. The following settings indicate how the driver should clear the specified buffer type:

<ul>
<li>
If <i>NumRect</i> is set to 0 (<i>NumRect</i>== 0) and D3DCLEAR_COMPUTERECTS is not set in <b>Flags</b>, the driver clears 0 pixels (that is, a no-op).

</li>
<li>
If <i>NumRect</i> is set to 0 and D3DCLEAR_COMPUTERECTS is set in <b>Flags</b>, the driver clears the entire viewport (not the entire surface).

</li>
<li>
If <i>NumRect</i> is set to a value greater than 0 (<i>NumRect</i>!= 0) and D3DCLEAR_COMPUTERECTS is set in <b>Flags</b>, the driver clips the rectangular areas that <b>pRect</b> specifies against the current viewport.

</li>
</ul>
Scissor testing also affects how the driver performs the clear operation. An application sets the D3DRS_SCISSORTESTENABLE render state in a call to the <b>IDirect3DDevice9::SetRenderState</b> method to enable scissor testing. For more information about scissor testing, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=144752">Scissor Test</a>. If the D3DRS_SCISSORTESTENABLE render state is set and the D3DCLEAR_COMPUTERECTS flag is set, the driver must clip the rectangular areas that <b>pRect</b> specifies to the scissor rectangular area. 

If <i>NumRect</i> is set to a value greater than 0 (<i>NumRect</i> &gt; 0) and D3DCLEAR_COMPUTERECTS is set in <b>Flags</b>, the driver clips the specified rectangular areas to the current viewport, and to the scissor rectangle if an application previously set D3DRS_SCISSORTESTENABLE. If <i>NumRect</i> &gt; 0 and D3DCLEAR_COMPUTERECTS is not set, the driver determines that the Direct3D runtime already clipped the specified rectangular areas to the current viewport, and to the scissor rectangle if an application previously set D3DRS_SCISSORTESTENABLE.
