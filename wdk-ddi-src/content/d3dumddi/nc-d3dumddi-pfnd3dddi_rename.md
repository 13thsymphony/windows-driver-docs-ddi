# PFND3DDDI_RENAME callback



## -description
The <i>Rename</i> function informs a user-mode display driver to start using the renamed allocation that the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_lockasync.md">LockAsync</a> function previously returned for the specified resource.



## -prototype

````
PFND3DDDI_RENAME Rename;

__checkReturn HRESULT APIENTRY Rename(
  _In_       HANDLE           hDevice,
  _In_ const D3DDDIARG_RENAME *pData
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hDevice [in]

 A handle to a display device (that is, the graphics context).


### -param pData [in]

 A pointer to a <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_rename.md">D3DDDIARG_RENAME</a> structure that describes the resource or surface within a resource to rename with a new allocation.


## -returns
<i>Rename</i> returns one of the following values:
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The resource is successfully renamed.
<dl>
<dt><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b></dt>
</dl><i>Rename</i> could not allocate the required memory for it to complete.

 


## -remarks
On multiple-processor computers, the Microsoft Direct3D runtime calls the user-mode display driver's <i>Rename</i> function from a worker thread instead of from the main application thread. The runtime calls <i>Rename</i>, at most, once for each successful call to the driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_lockasync.md">LockAsync</a> function with the <b>Discard</b> bit-field flag set in the <b>Flags</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_lockasync.md">D3DDDIARG_LOCKASYNC</a> structure that the <i>pData</i> parameter of <i>LockAsync</i> points to. 

<i>Rename</i> informs the driver to start using the renamed allocation that is specified by the <b>hCookie</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_rename.md">D3DDDIARG_RENAME</a> structure that the <i>pData</i> parameter of <i>Rename</i> points to. The <b>hCookie</b> handle was previously returned by the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_lockasync.md">LockAsync</a> function if the <b>Discard</b> bit-field flag was set for the locked resource. 

After <i>Rename</i> returns successfully (with S_OK), the user-mode display driver should use the allocation that <b>hCookie</b> specifies for all rendering operations that reference the resource that the <b>hResource</b> and <b>SubResourceIndex</b> members of D3DDDIARG_RENAME specify.
