# PFND3DDDI_RENAME callback function
The <i>Rename</i> function informs a user-mode display driver to start using the renamed allocation that the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_lockasync.md">LockAsync</a> function previously returned for the specified resource.

## Syntax

```
PFND3DDDI_RENAME Pfnd3dddiRename;

HRESULT Pfnd3dddiRename(
  HANDLE hDevice,
  CONST D3DDDIARG_RENAME *
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`hDevice`

A handle to a display device (that is, the graphics context).

`*`




## Return Value

<i>Rename</i> returns one of the following values:
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The resource is successfully renamed.
<dl>
<dt><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b></dt>
</dl><i>Rename</i> could not allocate the required memory for it to complete.

## Remarks

On multiple-processor computers, the Microsoft Direct3D runtime calls the user-mode display driver's <i>Rename</i> function from a worker thread instead of from the main application thread. The runtime calls <i>Rename</i>, at most, once for each successful call to the driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_lockasync.md">LockAsync</a> function with the <b>Discard</b> bit-field flag set in the <b>Flags</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_lockasync.md">D3DDDIARG_LOCKASYNC</a> structure that the <i>pData</i> parameter of <i>LockAsync</i> points to. 

<i>Rename</i> informs the driver to start using the renamed allocation that is specified by the <b>hCookie</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_rename.md">D3DDDIARG_RENAME</a> structure that the <i>pData</i> parameter of <i>Rename</i> points to. The <b>hCookie</b> handle was previously returned by the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_lockasync.md">LockAsync</a> function if the <b>Discard</b> bit-field flag was set for the locked resource. 

After <i>Rename</i> returns successfully (with S_OK), the user-mode display driver should use the allocation that <b>hCookie</b> specifies for all rendering operations that reference the resource that the <b>hResource</b> and <b>SubResourceIndex</b> members of D3DDDIARG_RENAME specify.
