# _DXVADDI_VIDEOSAMPLEFLAGS structure



## -description
The DXVADDI_VIDEOSAMPLEFLAGS structure identifies changes in the current sample frame from the previous sample frame.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _DXVADDI_VIDEOSAMPLEFLAGS {
  union {
    struct {
      UINT PaletteChanged  :1;
      UINT SrcRectChanged  :1;
      UINT DstRectChanged  :1;
      UINT ColorDataChanged  :1;
      UINT PlanarAlphaChanged  :1;
      UINT Reserved  :11;
      UINT SampleData  :16;
    };
    UINT   Value;
  };
} DXVADDI_VIDEOSAMPLEFLAGS;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field PaletteChanged

A UINT value that specifies whether the palette of the sample frame changed. Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000001).


### -field SrcRectChanged

A UINT value that specifies whether the source rectangle of the sample frame changed. Setting this member is equivalent to setting the second bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000002).


### -field DstRectChanged

A UINT value that specifies whether the destination rectangle of the sample frame changed. Setting this member is equivalent to setting the third bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000004).


### -field ColorDataChanged

A UINT value that specifies whether the color data of the sample frame changed. Setting this member is equivalent to setting the fourth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000008).


### -field PlanarAlphaChanged

A UINT value that specifies whether the alpha (transparency) data of the sample frame changed. Setting this member is equivalent to setting the fourth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000008).


### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member to zero is equivalent to setting the sixth through sixteenth bits (0x0000FFE0) of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member to zeros.


### -field SampleData

A UINT value that contains video sample data. Setting this member is equivalent to setting the seventeenth through thirty-second bits (0xFFFF0000) of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member. The following bits can be set:

DXVADDI_SAMPLEDATA_RFF (0x0001)

DXVADDI_SAMPLEDATA_TFF (0x0002)

DXVADDI_SAMPLEDATA_RFF_TFF_PRESENT (0x0004) 


### -field Value

A member in the union that is contained in DXVADDI_VIDEOSAMPLEFLAGS that can hold one 32-bit value that identifies changes in the current sample frame from the previous sample frame.
