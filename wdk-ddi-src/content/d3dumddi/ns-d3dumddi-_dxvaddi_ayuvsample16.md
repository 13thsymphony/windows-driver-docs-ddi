# _DXVADDI_AYUVSAMPLE16 structure
The DXVADDI_AYUVSAMPLE16 structure describes 16-bit Cr, Cb, and Y color values and an associated opacity.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DXVADDI_AYUVSAMPLE16 {
  USHORT Cr;
  USHORT Cb;
  USHORT Y;
  USHORT Alpha;
} DXVADDI_AYUVSAMPLE16;
````

## Members


`Alpha`

[in] The 16-bit opacity of the pixel when it is used as a source graphic for blending with another picture.

`Cb`

[in] A 16-bit chrominance (U) sample value.

`Cr`

[in] A 16-bit chrominance (V) sample value.

`Y`

[in] A 16-bit luminance (Y) sample value.

## Remarks
A value of 0 in the <b>Alpha</b> member indicates that the pixel is transparent (so that the other entries have no effect on the resulting blended picture), and a value of 255 indicates that the pixel is opaque (so that the other entries completely determine the value of the resulting blended picture sample). 

For nonzero values of <b>Alpha</b>, the blend to use is calculated by the following expression:
<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>( ( ( (Alpha + 1) x (graphic value) ) + ( (255 - Alpha) x (picture value) ) )  + 128 ) &gt;&gt; 8</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>If <b>Alpha</b> is 0, the specified blend to use is the picture value without alteration. 

The color value is scaled according to ITU-R Rec. BT.601, which you can learn about from the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=8741">International Telecommunication Union</a> website. Therefore, the color black is nominally specified by Y=16, Cb=Cr=128, and the color white is nominally specified by Y=235, Cb=Cr=128.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    If the alpha-blending surface originates as a DVD video subpicture, the preferred method for converting from the 4-bit alpha that is used by DVD video to the 8-bit alpha that is specified by <b>Alpha</b> is to map a 4-bit alpha value of zero to an 8-bit alpha value of zero and to convert all of the nonzero 4-bit alphas to 8-bit alphas by performing a left shift of four places and adding the constant 15.</div><div> </div>The width and height of the AYUV alpha-blending surface are specified in the associated <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7d820491-2df2-4036-8f3d-e6bcff4cd1f6">buffer description list</a> that is defined by the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_dxvaddi_decodebufferdesc.md">DXVADDI_DECODEBUFFERDESC</a> structure.
