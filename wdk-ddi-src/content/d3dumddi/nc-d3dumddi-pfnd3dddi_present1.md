# PFND3DDDI_PRESENT1 callback function
Notifies the user-mode display driver that an application finished rendering and that all ownership of the shared resource is released, and requests that the driver display to the destination surface.

## Syntax

```
PFND3DDDI_PRESENT1 Pfnd3dddiPresent1;

HRESULT Pfnd3dddiPresent1(
  HANDLE hDevice,
  D3DDDIARG_PRESENT1 *
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`hDevice`

A handle to the display device (graphics context).

`*`




## Return Value

Returns <b>S_OK</b> or an appropriate error result if the function does not complete successfully.

## Remarks

The user-mode display driver must submit all partially built render data (command buffers) by calling the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_rendercb.md">pfnRenderCb</a>  function. The driver must make only  a single call to <b>pfnRenderCb</b>.
