# PFND3DDDI_UNLOCK callback function
The <i>Unlock</i> function unlocks a resource or a surface within the resource that was previously locked by the <i>Lock</i> function.

## Syntax

```
PFND3DDDI_UNLOCK Pfnd3dddiUnlock;

HRESULT Pfnd3dddiUnlock(
  HANDLE hDevice,
  CONST D3DDDIARG_UNLOCK *
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`hDevice`

A handle to the display device (graphics context).

`*`




## Return Value

<i>Unlock</i> returns one of the following values:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The resource is successfully unlocked.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
<i>Unlock</i> could not allocate the required memory for it to complete.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_INVALIDARG</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The resource that <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_unlock.md">D3DDDIARG_UNLOCK</a> describes was not locked by a previous call to the driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_lock.md">Lock</a> function. 

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

These comments are analogous to the description in the Remarks section of the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_lock.md">Lock</a> reference page.

The user-mode display driver must call the Microsoft Direct3D runtime's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_unlockcb.md">pfnUnlockCb</a> function after <i>Unlock</i> is called. In this <b>pfnUnlockCb</b> call, the user-mode display driver passes an allocation handle. Before calling <b>pfnUnlockCb</b>, the user-mode display driver must first map the surface to an appropriate allocation. 

The runtime calls the user-mode display driver's <i>Unlock</i> function to unlock preallocated system memory surfaces as well. The runtime sets the <b>NotifyOnly</b> bit-field flag in the <b>Flags</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_unlock.md">D3DDDIARG_UNLOCK</a> structure that is pointed to by <i>pData</i> to differentiate <i>Unlock</i> calls that unlock preallocated system memory from other <i>Unlock</i> calls. If the user-mode display driver's <i>Lock</i> function called <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_lockcb.md">pfnLockCb</a> to lock the system memory allocation that corresponds to the surface, it must also call <b>pfnUnlockCb</b>. Not calling <b>pfnUnlockCb</b>  stops the coordination between the runtime, the user-mode display driver, and the display miniport driver.
