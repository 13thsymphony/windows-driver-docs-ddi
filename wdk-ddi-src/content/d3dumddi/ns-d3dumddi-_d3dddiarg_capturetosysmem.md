# _D3DDDIARG_CAPTURETOSYSMEM structure



## -description
The D3DDDIARG_CAPTURETOSYSMEM structure describes the parameters of a bit-block transfer (bitblt) from a capture buffer to a video memory surface. 



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _D3DDDIARG_CAPTURETOSYSMEM {
  HANDLE hSrcResource;
  RECT   SrcRect;
  HANDLE hDstResource;
  UINT   DstSubResourceIndex;
  RECT   DstRect;
} D3DDDIARG_CAPTURETOSYSMEM;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field hSrcResource

[in] A handle to the source resource.


### -field SrcRect

[in] A <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569234">RECT</a> structure for the source rectangle. 


### -field hDstResource

[in] A handle to the destination resource.


### -field DstSubResourceIndex

[in] The index to the destination surface within the resource. 


### -field DstRect

[in] A <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569234">RECT</a> structure for the destination rectangle. 


## -remarks
Because the source resource that is specified by the <b>hSrcResource</b> member is a capture buffer, it is guaranteed to be a stand alone resource. Therefore, in a call to <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_capturetosysmem.md">CaptureToSysMem</a>, the Microsoft Direct3D runtime is not required to supply an index to a sub source surface within the resource. However, an index to a sub source surface is required when the runtime calls the user-mode display driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_blt.md">Blt</a> function to perform a more general bitblt.
