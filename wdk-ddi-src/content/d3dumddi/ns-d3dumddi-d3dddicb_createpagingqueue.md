# D3DDDICB_CREATEPAGINGQUEUE structure



## -description
<b>D3DDDICB_CREATEPAGINGQUEUE</b> is used with <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_createpagingqueuecb.md">pfnCreatePagingQueueCb</a> to create a device paging queue that can be used to synchronize with video memory management operations for the device, such as making the device resource resident.


## -syntax

````
typedef struct D3DDDICB_CREATEPAGINGQUEUE {
  D3DDDI_PAGINGQUEUE_PRIORITY Priority;
  D3DKMT_HANDLE               hPagingQueue;
  D3DKMT_HANDLE               hSyncObject;
  VOID                        *FenceValueCPUVirtualAddress;
  UINT                        PhysicalAdapterIndex;
} D3DDDICB_CREATEPAGINGQUEUE;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Priority

[in] Scheduling priority relative to other paging queues on this device. Paging queues with higher priority values will be processed ahead of paging queues with lower priority values.

### -field hPagingQueue

[out] A paging queue handle that will be used to synchronize paging operations.

### -field hSyncObject

[out] Handle to the monitored fence object used to synchronize paging operations for this paging queue. Destroying the paging queue (either implicitly or explicitly) will automatically destroy this sync object.

### -field FenceValueCPUVirtualAddress

[out] A read-only mapping of the paging fence object value for the CPU. This is a user mode address readable from the process that created the monitored fence object.

### -field PhysicalAdapterIndex

[in] Physical adapter index (engine ordinal) for the queue.

## -remarks
A device can have multiple paging queues created for it. Paging queues can be destroyed either explicitly by calling <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_destroypagingqueuecb.md">pfnDestroyPagingQueueCb</a>, or by implicitly destroying the device they belong to. After the latter, paging queue handles will become invalid.
