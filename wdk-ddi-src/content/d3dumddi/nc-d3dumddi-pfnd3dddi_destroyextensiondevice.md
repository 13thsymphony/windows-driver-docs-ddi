# PFND3DDDI_DESTROYEXTENSIONDEVICE callback function
The <b>DestroyExtensionDevice</b> function releases resources for a Microsoft DirectX Video Acceleration (VA) extension device.

## Syntax

```
PFND3DDDI_DESTROYEXTENSIONDEVICE Pfnd3dddiDestroyextensiondevice;

HRESULT Pfnd3dddiDestroyextensiondevice(
  HANDLE hDevice,
  HANDLE hExtension
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`hDevice`

A handle to the display device (graphics context).

`hExtension`

A handle to the DirectX VA extension device that the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_createextensiondevice.md">CreateExtensionDevice</a> function created.


## Return Value

<b>DestroyExtensionDevice</b> should return S_OK or an appropriate error result if it cannot successfully release resources for the DirectX VA extension device.

## Remarks

The <b>DestroyExtensionDevice</b> function notifies the driver to destroy the handle to the DirectX VA extension device that the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_createextensiondevice.md">CreateExtensionDevice</a> function previously created. The driver can then release resources that are associated with the DirectX VA extension device handle.
