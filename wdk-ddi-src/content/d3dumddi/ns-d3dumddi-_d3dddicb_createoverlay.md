# _D3DDDICB_CREATEOVERLAY structure
The D3DDDICB_CREATEOVERLAY structure describes overlay hardware.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DDDICB_CREATEOVERLAY {
  D3DDDI_VIDEO_PRESENT_SOURCE_ID VidPnSourceId;
  D3DDDI_KERNELOVERLAYINFO       OverlayInfo;
  D3DKMT_HANDLE                  hKernelOverlay;
} D3DDDICB_CREATEOVERLAY;
````

## Members


`hKernelOverlay`

[out] A D3DKMT_HANDLE data type that represents a kernel-mode handle to the kernel-mode overlay object. This overlay object represents the overlay hardware in subsequent calls by the user-mode display driver to the Microsoft Direct3D runtime.

`OverlayInfo`

[in] A <a href="..\d3dukmdt\ns-d3dukmdt-_d3dddi_kerneloverlayinfo.md">D3DDDI_KERNELOVERLAYINFO</a> structure that describes information about the kernel-mode overlay object.

`VidPnSourceId`

[in] The zero-based identification number of the video present source in a path of a video present network (VidPN) topology to overlay on (that is, the identifier of the primary surface to overlay on).
