# _D3DDDIARG_VOLUMEBLT1 structure
Describes parameters for a volume bit-block transfer (bitblt) operation.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DDDIARG_VOLUMEBLT1 {
  HANDLE    hDstResource;
  HANDLE    hSrcResource;
  UINT      DstX;
  UINT      DstY;
  UINT      DstZ;
  D3DDDIBOX SrcBox;
  UINT      CopyFlags;
} D3DDDIARG_VOLUMEBLT1;
````

## Members


`CopyFlags`

A value that specifies characteristics of a copy operation as a bitwise OR of the values in the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ne-d3dumddi-d3dddi_copy_flags.md">D3DDDI_COPY_FLAGS</a> enumeration type.

`DstX`

[in] The width, in screen coordinates, of the destination volume in which the source volume is copied.

`DstY`

[in] The height, in screen coordinates, of the destination volume in which the source volume is copied.

`DstZ`

[in] The depth, in screen coordinates, of the destination volume in which the source volume is copied.

`hDstResource`

[in] A handle to the destination surface.

`hSrcResource`

[in] A handle to the source surface.

`SrcBox`

[in] A <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddibox.md">D3DDDIBOX</a> structure that describes the source volume texture to copy to the destination.
