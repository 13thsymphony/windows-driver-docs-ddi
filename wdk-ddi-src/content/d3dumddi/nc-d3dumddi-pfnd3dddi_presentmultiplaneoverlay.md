# PFND3DDDI_PRESENTMULTIPLANEOVERLAY callback function
Called by the Microsoft Direct3D runtime to notify the user-mode display driver that an application finished rendering and requests that the driver display the source surface by either copying or flipping or that the driver perform a color-fill operation. Must be implemented by Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) 1.3 or later drivers that support multiplane overlays.

## Syntax

```
PFND3DDDI_PRESENTMULTIPLANEOVERLAY Pfnd3dddiPresentmultiplaneoverlay;

HRESULT Pfnd3dddiPresentmultiplaneoverlay(
  HANDLE hDevice,
  CONST D3DDDIARG_PRESENTMULTIPLANEOVERLAY *
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`hDevice`

A handle to the display device (graphics context).

`*`




## Return Value

If this routine succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.

## Remarks

When the user-mode display driver successfully completes its processing of a call to this function, it presents the source surface to the display by calling the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh780323">pfnPresentMultiPlaneOverlayCb (D3D)</a> function.
