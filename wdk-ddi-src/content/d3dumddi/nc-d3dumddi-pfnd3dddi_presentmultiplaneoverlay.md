# PFND3DDDI_PRESENTMULTIPLANEOVERLAY callback



## -description
Called by the Microsoft Direct3D runtime to notify the user-mode display driver that an application finished rendering and requests that the driver display the source surface by either copying or flipping or that the driver perform a color-fill operation. Must be implemented by Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) 1.3 or later drivers that support multiplane overlays.



## -prototype

````
PFND3DDDI_PRESENTMULTIPLANEOVERLAY pfnPresentMultiPlaneOverlay;

_Check_return_ HRESULT APIENTRY* pfnPresentMultiPlaneOverlay(
  _In_       HANDLE                             hDevice,
  _In_ const D3DDDIARG_PRESENTMULTIPLANEOVERLAY *pPresent
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hDevice [in]

A handle to the display device (graphics context).


### -param pPresent [in]

A pointer to a <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-d3dddiarg_presentmultiplaneoverlay.md">D3DDDIARG_PRESENTMULTIPLANEOVERLAY</a> structure that describes how to display to the destination surface. 


## -returns
If this routine succeeds, it returns <b>S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b>HRESULT</b> error code.


## -remarks
When the user-mode display driver successfully completes its processing of a call to this function, it presents the source surface to the display by calling the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh780323">pfnPresentMultiPlaneOverlayCb (D3D)</a> function.
