# PFND3DDDI_DESTROYRESOURCE callback function
The <b>DestroyResource</b> function releases a specified resource.

## Syntax

```
PFND3DDDI_DESTROYRESOURCE Pfnd3dddiDestroyresource;

HRESULT Pfnd3dddiDestroyresource(
  HANDLE hDevice,
   HANDLE
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`hDevice`

A handle to the display device (graphics context) that is used to destroy the resource.

`HANDLE`




## Return Value

<b>DestroyResource</b> returns S_OK or an appropriate error result is the resource is not released.

## Remarks

After the Microsoft Direct3D runtime calls the user-mode display driver's <b>DestroyResource</b> function, the user-mode display driver must first flush any batched commands that depend on the resource that is being destroyed by calling the runtime's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_rendercb.md">pfnRenderCb</a> function. The driver must then call the runtime's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_deallocatecb.md">pfnDeallocateCb</a> function to destroy allocations that are associated with the resource. 
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    The driver's <b>DestroyResource</b> function is not required to call <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_deallocatecb.md">pfnDeallocateCb</a> before returning; instead, the driver can defer allocation destruction.</div><div> </div><div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    A separate <b>DestroyResource</b> call is not made for each surface that is part of the resource. So, if a group of surfaces is atomically created, the group is always atomically destroyed as well. </div><div> </div>For more information about creating and destroying resources, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d443bdc3-1c5a-4372-9e6a-b8a4d21499b9">Handling Resource Creation and Destruction</a>.
