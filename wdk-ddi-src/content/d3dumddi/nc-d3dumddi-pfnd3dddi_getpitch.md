# PFND3DDDI_GETPITCH callback



## -description
The <i>GetPitch</i> function retrieves the pitch of a protected or non-lockable surface. 


## -prototype

````
PFND3DDDI_GETPITCH GetPitch;

__checkReturn HRESULT APIENTRY GetPitch(
  _In_    HANDLE             hDevice,
  _Inout_ D3DDDIARG_GETPITCH *pData
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hDevice [in]

 A handle to the display device (graphics context). 

### -param pData [in, out]

 A pointer to a <a href="display.d3dddiarg_getpitch">D3DDDIARG_GETPITCH</a> structure that describes the protected surface. 

## -returns
The <i>GetPitch</i> function returns one of the following values:
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The pitch of the protected surface is successfully retrieved. 
<dl>
<dt><b>D3DDDIERR_NOTAVAILABLE</b></dt>
</dl>The driver does not support the <i>GetPitch</i> function. 

 

## -remarks
Hardware and drivers can optionally support the <i>GetPitch</i> function.  

The surface for which the <i>GetPitch</i> function returns the pitch can be non-lockable or protected. Therefore, the application cannot retrieve the pitch of the surface through a call to the driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_lock.md">Lock</a> function. The application must retrieve the pitch of the surface to properly allocate the system memory buffer that the application subsequently uses in calls to the driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_encryptionblt.md">EncryptionBlt</a> and <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_decryptionblt.md">DecryptionBlt</a> functions.
