# PFND3DDDI_ISSUEQUERY callback



## -description
The <i>IssueQuery</i> function processes a query.



## -prototype

````
PFND3DDDI_ISSUEQUERY IssueQuery;

__checkReturn HRESULT APIENTRY IssueQuery(
  _In_       HANDLE               hDevice,
  _In_ const D3DDDIARG_ISSUEQUERY *pData
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hDevice [in]

 A handle to the display device (graphics context).


### -param pData [in]

 A pointer to a <a href="display.d3dddiarg_issuequery">D3DDDIARG_ISSUEQUERY</a> structure that describes how to process the query.


## -returns
<i>IssueQuery</i> returns one of the following values:
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The query is successfully processed.
<dl>
<dt><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b></dt>
</dl><i>IssueQuery</i> could not allocate the required memory for it to complete.

 


## -remarks
 The user-mode display driver should set a fence value and store the fence value in the driver's private query structure. The user-mode display driver implements the query by using a fence. If the <i>IssueQuery</i> function is called on a query again before a previous query issue completes, the driver should overwrite the fence value and ignore the previous query issue.

If the call to <i>IssueQuery</i> requires the driver to return data, the driver should insert a graphics processing unit (GPU) instruction to write the required data to an allocation. In the call to the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_getquerydata.md">GetQueryData</a> function, the driver should typically lock the allocation and return the appropriate data.
