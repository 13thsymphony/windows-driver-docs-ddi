# PFND3DDDI_ISSUEQUERY callback function
The <i>IssueQuery</i> function processes a query.

## Syntax

```
PFND3DDDI_ISSUEQUERY Pfnd3dddiIssuequery;

HRESULT Pfnd3dddiIssuequery(
  HANDLE hDevice,
  CONST D3DDDIARG_ISSUEQUERY *
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`hDevice`

A handle to the display device (graphics context).

`*`




## Return Value

<i>IssueQuery</i> returns one of the following values:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The query is successfully processed.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
<i>IssueQuery</i> could not allocate the required memory for it to complete.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

The user-mode display driver should set a fence value and store the fence value in the driver's private query structure. The user-mode display driver implements the query by using a fence. If the <i>IssueQuery</i> function is called on a query again before a previous query issue completes, the driver should overwrite the fence value and ignore the previous query issue.

If the call to <i>IssueQuery</i> requires the driver to return data, the driver should insert a graphics processing unit (GPU) instruction to write the required data to an allocation. In the call to the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_getquerydata.md">GetQueryData</a> function, the driver should typically lock the allocation and return the appropriate data.
