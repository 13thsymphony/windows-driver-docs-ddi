# _D3DDDIARG_DRAWINDEXEDPRIMITIVE structure



## -description
The D3DDDIARG_DRAWINDEXEDPRIMITIVE structure describes an indexed primitive to draw.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _D3DDDIARG_DRAWINDEXEDPRIMITIVE {
  D3DPRIMITIVETYPE PrimitiveType;
  INT              BaseVertexIndex;
  UINT             MinIndex;
  UINT             NumVertices;
  UINT             StartIndex;
  UINT             PrimitiveCount;
} D3DDDIARG_DRAWINDEXEDPRIMITIVE;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field PrimitiveType

[in] A D3DPRIMITIVETYPE-typed value that indicates the type of primitive to draw. This member can be one of the following values: D3DPT_POINTLIST, D3DPT_LINELIST, D3DPT_LINESTRIP, D3DPT_TRIANGLELIST, D3DPT_TRIANGLESTRIP, or D3DPT_TRIANGLEFAN. For more information about D3DPRIMITIVETYPE, see the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.


### -field BaseVertexIndex

[in] The number that should be added to each index that is referenced by the various primitives to determine the actual index of the vertex elements in each vertex stream.


### -field MinIndex

[in] The minimum index of a range of vertices that are potentially accessed by the primitives to be drawn and, therefore, which vertices should be processed.


### -field NumVertices

[in] The number of vertices in a range that are potentially accessed by the primitives to be drawn and, therefore, which vertices should be processed.


### -field StartIndex

[in] The first index in the index buffer from which indices are read to draw the primitives.


### -field PrimitiveCount

[in] The number of triangles, lines, or points to draw for the given primitive. 


## -remarks
The Microsoft Direct3D runtime does not transform the index data before passing a pointer to the description of the index data in the <i>pData</i> parameter in a call to the user-mode display driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_drawindexedprimitive.md">DrawIndexedPrimitive</a> function.
