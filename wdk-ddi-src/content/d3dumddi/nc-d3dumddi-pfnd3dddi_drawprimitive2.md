# PFND3DDDI_DRAWPRIMITIVE2 callback



## -description
The <b>DrawPrimitive2</b> function draws nonindexed primitives in which the Microsoft Direct3D runtime has transformed the vertex data.



## -prototype

````
PFND3DDDI_DRAWPRIMITIVE2 DrawPrimitive2;

__checkReturn HRESULT APIENTRY DrawPrimitive2(
  _In_       HANDLE                   hDevice,
  _In_ const D3DDDIARG_DRAWPRIMITIVE2 *pData
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hDevice [in]

 A handle to the display device (graphics context).


### -param pData [in]

 A pointer to a <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_drawprimitive2.md">D3DDDIARG_DRAWPRIMITIVE2</a> structure that describes the primitive to draw.


## -returns
<b>DrawPrimitive2</b> returns S_OK or an appropriate error result if the primitive is not successfully drawn.


## -remarks
Stream zero contains transform vertices and is the only stream that should be accessed.
