# D3DDDICB_LOGUMDMARKER structure
Specifies info about the location of an Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) marker event that the user-mode display driver has defined.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct D3DDDICB_LOGUMDMARKER {
  HANDLE  hContext;
  UINT64  APISequenceNumber;
  INT     Index;
  INT     StringIndex;
  LPCWSTR Info;
} D3DDDICB_LOGUMDMARKER;
````

## Members


`APISequenceNumber`

The API sequence number that the marker event is associated with.

`hContext`

[in] A handle to a Direct3D context that signals ETW marker events. This is also the context that the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_rendercb.md">pfnRenderCb</a> function will be called on.

`Index`

Indicates which API sequence call caused this marker event. If zero, the marker event corresponds to the latest API sequence number after a call to the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_setmarker.md">pfnSetMarker</a> function. If 1, the marker event is located at the following API sequence number. And so on.

Should be -1 if no time stamps are associated with this marker event.

`Info`

A custom text string embedded in the ETW packet. Can be <b>NULL</b>.

`StringIndex`

The offset, in bytes, of the string table entry pointed to by <b>Info</b>. Can be negative if the string is passed along with the marker event.
