# PFND3DDDI_PRESENT1 callback



## -description
Notifies the user-mode display driver that an application finished rendering and that all ownership of the shared resource is released, and requests that the driver display to the destination surface.


## -prototype

````
PFND3DDDI_PRESENT1 pfnPresent1;

__checkReturn HRESULT* pfnPresent1(
  _In_       HANDLE             *hDevice,
  _In_ const D3DDDIARG_PRESENT1 *pPresentData
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hDevice [in]

A handle to the display device (graphics context).

### -param pPresentData [in]

A pointer to a <a href="display.d3dddiarg_present1">D3DDDIARG_PRESENT1</a> structure that describes how to display to the destination surface. 

## -returns

      Returns <b>S_OK</b> or an appropriate error result if the function does not complete successfully.

## -remarks
The user-mode display driver must submit all partially built render data (command buffers) by calling the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_rendercb.md">pfnRenderCb</a>  function. The driver must make only  a single call to <b>pfnRenderCb</b>.
