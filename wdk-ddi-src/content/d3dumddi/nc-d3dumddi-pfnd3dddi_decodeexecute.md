# PFND3DDDI_DECODEEXECUTE callback



## -description
The <b>DecodeExecute</b> function performs a decode operation by using the given Microsoft DirectX Video Accelerator (VA) decode device.



## -prototype

````
PFND3DDDI_DECODEEXECUTE DecodeExecute;

__checkReturn HRESULT APIENTRY DecodeExecute(
  _In_       HANDLE                  hDevice,
  _In_ const D3DDDIARG_DECODEEXECUTE *pData
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hDevice [in]

 A handle to the display device (graphics context).


### -param pData [in]

 A pointer to a <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_decodeexecute.md">D3DDDIARG_DECODEEXECUTE</a> structure that describes the DirectX VA decode operation to perform.


## -returns
<b>DecodeExecute</b> returns one of the following values:
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The DirectX VA decode operation is successfully performed.
<dl>
<dt><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b></dt>
</dl>
<a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_decodeexecute.md">DecodeExecute</a> could not allocate the required memory for it to complete.

 


## -remarks
The Microsoft Direct3D runtime calls the <b>DecodeExecute</b> function for all of the standard DirectX VA decode operations. When <b>DecodeExecute</b> is first called for each frame, the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_decodeexecute.md">D3DDDIARG_DECODEEXECUTE</a> structure that is specified by <b>pData</b> should contain all of the buffer information that is required for decoding the frame. <b>DecodeExecute</b> can subsequently be called for the same frame; however, these calls require only incremental data. If the GUID for the particular DirectX VA decode type does not use a buffer that is specified in D3DDDIARG_DECODEEXECUTE, the handle and description for the buffer are set to <b>NULL</b>. For example, because the MPEG2 decode type requires picture parameters, a macroblock buffer, and a residual-difference buffer, all of these items must be present in the first call for each frame. Depending on the size of the data, however, the Direct3D runtime might call <b>DecodeExecute</b> again to supply only additional residual-difference data that is required to decode the entire frame. 

DirectX VA 1.0 supported an external synchronization mechanism through a call to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/af62d169-665a-43d2-ac0c-cc8ce6ce42d0">DdMoCompQueryStatus</a> function. In DirectX VA 2.0, the user-mode display driver should perform its own synchronization, similar to the way it synchronizes the 3-D pipe. For more information about this synchronization, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4c88bf8f-0f10-4281-b856-a0e056d69d0e">Synchronizing Video Decode Operations</a>.
