# PFND3DDDI_OFFERALLOCATIONS2CB callback function
Called by the user-mode display driver   to offer  video memory allocations for reuse.

## Syntax

```
PFND3DDDI_OFFERALLOCATIONS2CB Pfnd3dddiOfferallocations2cb;

HRESULT Pfnd3dddiOfferallocations2cb(
  HANDLE hDevice,
  CONST D3DDDICB_OFFERALLOCATIONS2 *
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`hDevice`

A handle to the display device (graphics context). The Direct3D runtime passed the user-mode driver this handle as the <b>hDevice</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_createdevice.md">D3DDDIARG_CREATEDEVICE</a> structure at device creation.

`*`




## Return Value

Returns one of the following values.
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The  allocations were successfully offered.
<dl>
<dt><b>D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED</b></dt>
</dl>
         The video memory manager or display miniport driver could not complete the operation because either a Plug and Play (PnP) Stop event or a Timeout Detection and Recovery (TDR) event occurred.
<dl>
<dt><b>E_INVALIDARG</b></dt>
</dl>An invalid parameter was supplied.

## Remarks

The user-mode display driver calls <b>pfnOfferAllocations2Cb</b> to notify the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem that, after it completes any previously submitted render operations,  it can offer the allocations' memory for other processes to use.

After the driver calls <b>pfnOfferAllocations2Cb</b> to offer an allocation to reuse, it must call <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_reclaimallocations3cb.md">pfnReclaimAllocations3Cb</a>  before it locks the allocation or submits it for rendering operations.

<b>pfnOfferAllocations2Cb</b> functions identically to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451693">pfnOfferAllocationsCb</a>, except that it takes flags into account through the pData parameter.
