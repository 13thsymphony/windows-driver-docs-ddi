# _D3DDDIARG_DRAWPRIMITIVE2 structure
The D3DDDIARG_DRAWPRIMITIVE2 structure describes a nonindexed primitive to draw.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DDDIARG_DRAWPRIMITIVE2 {
  D3DPRIMITIVETYPE PrimitiveType;
  UINT             FirstVertexOffset;
  UINT             PrimitiveCount;
} D3DDDIARG_DRAWPRIMITIVE2;
````

## Members


`FirstVertexOffset`

[in] The offset, in bytes, in stream zero of the vertex data. This member differs from the <b>VStart</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_drawprimitive.md">D3DDDIARG_DRAWPRIMITIVE</a> structure that is used with the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_drawprimitive.md">DrawPrimitive</a> function. In <b>VStart</b>, the start of the vertex data in the vertex stream is specified by a vertex index rather than an actual byte offset.

`PrimitiveCount`

[in] The number of triangles, lines, or points to draw for the given primitive.

`PrimitiveType`

[in] A D3DPRIMITIVETYPE-typed value that indicates the type of primitive to draw. This member can be one of the following values: D3DPT_POINTLIST, D3DPT_LINELIST, D3DPT_LINESTRIP, D3DPT_TRIANGLELIST, D3DPT_TRIANGLESTRIP, or D3DPT_TRIANGLEFAN. For more information about D3DPRIMITIVETYPE, see the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.

## Remarks
The Microsoft Direct3D runtime transforms the vertex data before passing a pointer to the description of the vertex data in the <i>pData</i> parameter in a call to the user-mode display driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_drawprimitive2.md">DrawPrimitive2</a> function.
