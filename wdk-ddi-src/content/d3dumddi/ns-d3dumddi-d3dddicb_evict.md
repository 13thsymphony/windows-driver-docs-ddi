# D3DDDICB_EVICT structure
<b>D3DKMT_EVICT</b> is used with <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5E66A522-BC1C-4E7C-8732-87D40F99BBDA">pfnEvictCb</a> to subtract one from the residency reference count.

Once this count reaches zero, it will remove the allocation from the device residency list.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct D3DDDICB_EVICT {
  UINT                NumAllocations;
  CONST D3DKMT_HANDLE *AllocationList;
  D3DDDI_EVICT_FLAGS  Flags;
  UINT64              NumBytesToTrim;
};
```

## Members


`NumAllocations`

[in] Number of allocation handles in the <b>AllocationList</b> array.

`AllocationList`

[in] An array of <b>NumAllocations</b> allocation handles to mark for eviction. All allocations must be created on <b>hDevice</b>.

`Flags`

[in] Specifies eviction behavior as documented in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn906322">D3DDDI_EVICT_FLAGS</a>.

`NumBytesToTrim`

[out] When non-zero, specifies how much the application should evict in order to meet its current memory budget.
