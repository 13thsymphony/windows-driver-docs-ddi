# _D3DDDIARG_CREATEDECODEDEVICE structure



## -description
The D3DDDIARG_CREATEDECODEDEVICE structure describes a Microsoft DirectX Video Acceleration (DirectX VA) decode device to create. 



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _D3DDDIARG_CREATEDECODEDEVICE {
  const GUID                  *pGuid;
  DXVADDI_VIDEODESC           VideoDesc;
  DXVADDI_CONFIGPICTUREDECODE *pConfig;
  HANDLE                      hDecode;
} D3DDDIARG_CREATEDECODEDEVICE;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field pGuid

[in] A pointer to the GUID that represents the DirectX VA decode type. The Microsoft Direct3D runtime calls the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_getcaps.md">GetCaps</a> function to query for the supported GUIDs.


### -field VideoDesc

[in] The <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_dxvaddi_videodesc.md">DXVADDI_VIDEODESC</a> structure for the video stream that the decode device should decode.


### -field pConfig

[in] A pointer to the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_dxvaddi_configpicturedecode.md">DXVADDI_CONFIGPICTUREDECODE</a> structure that contains the DirectX VA connection configuration data for compressed picture decoding that the decode device requires. The Direct3D runtime calls the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_getcaps.md">GetCaps</a> function to query for the supported configurations.


### -field hDecode

[in/out] A handle to the decode device. The user-mode display driver must set this handle to a value that the Direct3D runtime can use to identify the decode device in subsequent calls.
