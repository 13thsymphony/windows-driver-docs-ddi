# _D3DDDIARG_VIEWPORTINFO structure
The D3DDDIARG_VIEWPORTINFO structure describes the location and size of a view-clipping rectangle.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DDDIARG_VIEWPORTINFO {
  UINT X;
  UINT Y;
  UINT Width;
  UINT Height;
} D3DDDIARG_VIEWPORTINFO;
````

## Members


`Height`

[in] The height, in screen coordinates, of the view-clipping rectangle where the application is rendering.

`Width`

[in] The width, in screen coordinates, of the view-clipping rectangle where the application is rendering.

`X`

[in] The x coordinate, in screen coordinates, for the upper-left corner of the view-clipping rectangle.

`Y`

[in] The y coordinate, in screen coordinates, for the upper-left corner of the view-clipping rectangle.

## Remarks
The user-mode display driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_setviewport.md">SetViewport</a> function should update the viewport portion of its internal rendering context with the location and size values that are specified in the D3DDDIARG_VIEWPORTINFO structure. The driver can use this information to perform guard band clipping.

## Requirements
