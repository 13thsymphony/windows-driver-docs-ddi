# _D3DDDIARG_DECODEEXECUTE structure
The D3DDDIARG_DECODEEXECUTE structure describes a Microsoft DirectX Video Acceleration (VA) decode operation to perform.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DDDIARG_DECODEEXECUTE {
  HANDLE                   hDecode;
  UINT                     NumCompBuffers;
  DXVADDI_DECODEBUFFERDESC *pCompressedBuffers;
} D3DDDIARG_DECODEEXECUTE;
````

## Members


`hDecode`

[in] A handle to the DirectX VA decode device. The user-mode display driver returns this handle in a call to its <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_createdecodedevice.md">CreateDecodeDevice</a> function.

`NumCompBuffers`

[in] The number of compressed buffer that are pointed to by the <b>pCompressedBuffers</b> member.

`pCompressedBuffers`

[in] A pointer to a list of <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_dxvaddi_decodebufferdesc.md">DXVADDI_DECODEBUFFERDESC</a> structures that describe the compressed buffers that are passed from the host decoder to the accelerator.
