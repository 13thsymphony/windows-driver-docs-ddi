# _D3DDDIARG_DXVAHD_CREATEVIDEOPROCESSOR structure
The D3DDDIARG_DXVAHD_CREATEVIDEOPROCESSOR structure describes a Microsoft DirectX Video Acceleration (DirectX VA) video processor to create.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DDDIARG_DXVAHD_CREATEVIDEOPROCESSOR {
  const GUID *pVPGuid;
  HANDLE     hVideoProcessor;
} D3DDDIARG_DXVAHD_CREATEVIDEOPROCESSOR;
````

## Members


`hVideoProcessor`

[out] A handle to the video processor. The user-mode display driver must set this handle to a value that the Microsoft Direct3D runtime can use to identify the video processor in subsequent calls.

`pVPGuid`

[in] A pointer to the GUID that represents a DirectX VA video processor to create. The Microsoft Direct3D runtime can call the user-mode display driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_getcaps.md">GetCaps</a> function to query (D3DDDICAPS_DXVAHD_GETVPCAPS) for the capabilities of the video processors that the driver supports. Each <b>VPGuid</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_dxvahdddi_vpcaps.md">DXVAHDDDI_VPCAPS</a> structure in the array that the driver's <b>GetCaps</b> returns specifies a video processor that the driver supports.
