# _D3DDDIARG_SETPRIORITY structure
The D3DDDIARG_SETPRIORITY structure describes the priority level to set for a managed texture.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DDDIARG_SETPRIORITY {
  HANDLE hResource;
  UINT   Priority;
} D3DDDIARG_SETPRIORITY;
````

## Members


`hResource`

A handle to the resource that contains the texture.

`Priority`

The priority level to set for the texture that is contained in the <b>hResource</b> resource. A texture's priority value can be set anywhere in the range from 0 through 0xFFFFFFFF.

## Remarks
The driver receives only priority notifications for driver-managed textures.

The priority level at which a texture is set determines its eviction order from memory. A texture that is assigned a low priority is evicted before a texture with a high priority. If two textures have the same priority, the texture that was used more recently is kept in memory; the other texture is evicted.
