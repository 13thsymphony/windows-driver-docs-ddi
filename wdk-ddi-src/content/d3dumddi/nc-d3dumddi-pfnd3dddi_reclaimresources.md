<td width="60%">
The video memory resources were successfully reclaimed.

This error code is returned if the driver does not need to call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451695">pfnReclaimAllocationsCb</a> function.

<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_INVALIDARG</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
An invalid parameter was supplied.

This error code is returned if the driver calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451695">pfnReclaimAllocationsCb</a> function and that function returns <b>E_INVALIDARG</b>.

The video memory manager or display miniport driver could not complete the operation because either a Plug and Play (PnP) Stop event or a Timeout Detection and Recovery (TDR) event occurred.

This error code is returned if the driver calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451695">pfnReclaimAllocationsCb</a> function and that function returns <b>D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED</b>.
