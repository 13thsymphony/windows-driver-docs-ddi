# _D3DDDIARG_EXTENSIONEXECUTE structure
The D3DDDIARG_EXTENSIONEXECUTE structure describes a Microsoft DirectX Video Acceleration (VA) extension operation to perform.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DDDIARG_EXTENSIONEXECUTE {
  HANDLE                hExtension;
  UINT                  Function;
  DXVADDI_PRIVATEDATA   *pPrivateInput;
  DXVADDI_PRIVATEDATA   *pPrivateOutput;
  UINT                  NumBuffers;
  DXVADDI_PRIVATEBUFFER *pBuffers;
} D3DDDIARG_EXTENSIONEXECUTE;
````

## Members


`Function`

[in] A specific operation to perform. The possible values for this member are defined by the extension device.

`hExtension`

[in] A handle to the DirectX VA extension device. The user-mode display driver returns this handle in a call to its <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_createextensiondevice.md">CreateExtensionDevice</a> function.

`NumBuffers`

[in] The number of buffers in the list that is pointed to by <b>pBuffers</b>.

`pBuffers`

[in] A pointer to a list of <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_dxvaddi_privatebuffer.md">DXVADDI_PRIVATEBUFFER</a> structures that describe private buffers that an extension device uses to perform an extended operation.

`pPrivateInput`

[in] A pointer to a <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_dxvaddi_privatedata.md">DXVADDI_PRIVATEDATA</a> structure that contains data that the driver requires to perform the extension operation.

`pPrivateOutput`

[in] A pointer to a DXVADDI_PRIVATEDATA structure that contains data about the extension operation that the driver returns.
