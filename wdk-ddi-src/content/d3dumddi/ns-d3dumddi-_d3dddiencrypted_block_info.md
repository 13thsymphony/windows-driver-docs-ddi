# _D3DDDIENCRYPTED_BLOCK_INFO structure
The D3DDDIENCRYPTED_BLOCK_INFO structure describes the portions of a buffer that are encrypted.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DDDIENCRYPTED_BLOCK_INFO {
  UINT NumEncryptedBytesAtBeginning;
  UINT NumBytesInSkipPattern;
  UINT NumBytesInEncryptPattern;
} D3DDDIENCRYPTED_BLOCK_INFO;
````

## Members

        
            `NumBytesInEncryptPattern`

            [in] The number of bytes in the buffer that are encrypted after the skip pattern, which the <b>NumBytesInSkipPattern</b> member specifies. The skip and encrypt pattern is then repeated until the buffer ends. For more information about the skip-encrypt pattern, see the Remarks section.
        
            `NumBytesInSkipPattern`

            [in] The number of bytes in the buffer that are skipped from encryption before encryption starts again.
        
            `NumEncryptedBytesAtBeginning`

            [in] The number of bytes at the beginning of the buffer that are encrypted.

    ## Remarks
        Because the buffer's encrypted portion is specified in bytes, an application must ensure that the encrypted blocks match the GPU's crypto-block alignment. 

The runtime can specify a populated D3DDDIENCRYPTED_BLOCK_INFO structure in the block of memory that the <b>pEncryptedBlockInfo</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_decryptionblt.md">D3DDDIARG_DECRYPTIONBLT</a> structure points to when the runtime calls the driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_decryptionblt.md">DecryptionBlt</a> function to write data to a protected surface. 

The following examples show how the runtime can partition a buffer's encryption.
