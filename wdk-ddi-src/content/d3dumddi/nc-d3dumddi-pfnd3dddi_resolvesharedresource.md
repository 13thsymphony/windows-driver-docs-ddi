# PFND3DDDI_RESOLVESHAREDRESOURCE callback



## -description
The <i>ResolveSharedResource</i> function informs a user-mode display driver that ownership of a shared surface changed or that a surface is being used for GDI interoperation. 



## -prototype

````
PFND3DDDI_RESOLVESHAREDRESOURCE ResolveSharedResource;

__checkReturn HRESULT APIENTRY ResolveSharedResource(
  _In_       HANDLE                          hDevice,
  _In_ const D3DDDIARG_RESOLVESHAREDRESOURCE *pData
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hDevice [in]

 A handle to the display device (that is, the graphics context) that is associated with the shared surface or GDI interoperable surface. 


### -param pData [in]

 A pointer to a <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_resolvesharedresource.md">D3DDDIARG_RESOLVESHAREDRESOURCE</a> structure that contains a handle to the surface. 


## -returns
<i>ResolveSharedResource</i> returns one of the following values:
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The resource is successfully resolved.
<dl>
<dt><b>D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED</b></dt>
</dl>The driver detects that the graphics adapter was removed. Therefore, the driver did not complete the operation. If the driver never notices the adapter-removal condition, the driver is not required to return this error code. 

 


## -remarks
The Direct3D runtime calls <i>ResolveSharedResource</i> when an application calls one of the following functions:

<b>IDXGIKeyedMutex::ReleaseSynch</b> on a synchronized shared surface 

<b>IDXGISurface1::GetDC</b> for a GDI interoperable surface 

The runtime calls the driver's <i>ResolveSharedResource</i> function every time a shared surface owner changes or when a surface is used for GDI interoperation. The runtime supplies <i>ResolveSharedResource</i> with handles to the display device--via the <i>hDevice</i> parameter-- and the surface--via the <i>pData</i> parameter.

The driver implements <i>ResolveSharedResource</i> to appropriately manage resources for multiple GPU scenarios. Each resource might be divided across memory for multiple GPUs to render on. The driver can implement <i>ResolveSharedResource</i> to remerge each resource so that the new resource owner has the merged resource. The driver must flush any partially built command buffers that might modify the resource.
