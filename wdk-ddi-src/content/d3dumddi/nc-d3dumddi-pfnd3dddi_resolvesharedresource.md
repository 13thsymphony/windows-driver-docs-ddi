# PFND3DDDI_RESOLVESHAREDRESOURCE callback function
The <i>ResolveSharedResource</i> function informs a user-mode display driver that ownership of a shared surface changed or that a surface is being used for GDI interoperation.

## Syntax

```
PFND3DDDI_RESOLVESHAREDRESOURCE Pfnd3dddiResolvesharedresource;

HRESULT Pfnd3dddiResolvesharedresource(
  HANDLE hDevice,
  CONST D3DDDIARG_RESOLVESHAREDRESOURCE *
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`hDevice`

A handle to the display device (that is, the graphics context) that is associated with the shared surface or GDI interoperable surface.

`*`




## Return Value

<i>ResolveSharedResource</i> returns one of the following values:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The resource is successfully resolved.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The driver detects that the graphics adapter was removed. Therefore, the driver did not complete the operation. If the driver never notices the adapter-removal condition, the driver is not required to return this error code. 

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

The Direct3D runtime calls <i>ResolveSharedResource</i> when an application calls one of the following functions:

<ul>
<li>
<b>IDXGIKeyedMutex::ReleaseSynch</b> on a synchronized shared surface 

</li>
<li>
<b>IDXGISurface1::GetDC</b> for a GDI interoperable surface 

</li>
</ul>
The runtime calls the driver's <i>ResolveSharedResource</i> function every time a shared surface owner changes or when a surface is used for GDI interoperation. The runtime supplies <i>ResolveSharedResource</i> with handles to the display device--via the <i>hDevice</i> parameter-- and the surface--via the <i>pData</i> parameter.

The driver implements <i>ResolveSharedResource</i> to appropriately manage resources for multiple GPU scenarios. Each resource might be divided across memory for multiple GPUs to render on. The driver can implement <i>ResolveSharedResource</i> to remerge each resource so that the new resource owner has the merged resource. The driver must flush any partially built command buffers that might modify the resource.

## Requirements
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows version** | ResolveSharedResource is supported beginning with the Windows 7 operating system.  |
| **Target Platform** | Desktop |
| **Header** | d3dumddi.h (include D3dumddi.h) |
