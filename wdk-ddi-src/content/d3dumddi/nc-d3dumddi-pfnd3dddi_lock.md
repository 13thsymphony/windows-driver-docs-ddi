# PFND3DDDI_LOCK callback function
The <i>Lock</i> function locks the given resource or a surface within the resource.

## Syntax

```
PFND3DDDI_LOCK Pfnd3dddiLock;

HRESULT Pfnd3dddiLock(
  HANDLE hDevice,
  D3DDDIARG_LOCK *
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`hDevice`

A handle to the display device (graphics context).

`*`




## Return Value

<i>Lock</i> returns one of the following values:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The resource is successfully locked.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b></dt>

</td>
<td width="60%">
<i>Lock</i> could not allocate the required memory for it to complete.

<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>D3DDDIERR_WASSTILLDRAWING</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The resource was not idle when the Microsoft Direct3D runtime called the <i>Lock</i> function with the <b>DoNotWait</b> bit-field flag set in the <b>Flags</b> member of <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_lock.md">D3DDDIARG_LOCK</a>.

</td>

</table>

## Remarks

The Microsoft Direct3D runtime calls the user-mode display driver's <i>Lock</i> function to lock a resource or a surface within the resource. This locked resource or surface can be read from or written to by using read and write operations from the CPU. When the runtime calls <i>Lock</i>, the user-mode display driver must call the runtime's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_lockcb.md">pfnLockCb</a> callback function to lock an allocation corresponding to the resource or surface. Note that because the user-mode display driver can allocate multiple allocations for each resource or surface, the user-mode display driver might be required to appropriately convert or process the allocation pointer that is returned from <b>pfnLockCb</b> before returning the <i>Lock</i> call to the runtime. 

Typically, calls to <i>Lock</i> are followed by matching calls to the driver's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_unlock.md">Unlock</a> function before the driver receives any calls to its draw-primitive functions (that is, calls to <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_drawindexedprimitive.md">DrawIndexedPrimitive</a>, <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_drawindexedprimitive2.md">DrawIndexedPrimitive2</a>, <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_drawprimitive.md">DrawPrimitive</a>, and <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_drawprimitive2.md">DrawPrimitive2</a>). This order guarantees that a driver is never requested to draw from a locked resource. However, on occasion, when performing software transform and lighting, the runtime must call one of the driver's draw-primitive functions before unlocking a resource (currently, only vertex buffers exhibit this behavior). The runtime marks vertex buffers on which this uncommon behavior might occur with the <b>MightDrawFromLocked</b> bit-field flag in the <b>Flags</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dukmdt\ns-d3dukmdt-_d3dddiarg_createresource.md">D3DDDIARG_CREATERESOURCE</a> and <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_lock.md">D3DDDIARG_LOCK</a> structures (that is, both at creation and at lock time). When the hardware actively renders from a locked vertex buffer, the driver is not required to take any special action because the runtime will not overwrite any data in the locked vertex buffer . 

The runtime calls the user-mode display driver's <i>Lock</i> function to lock preallocated system memory surfaces as well. This operation allows the user-mode display driver to properly synchronize references to such surfaces that might be in the hardware command stream. The user-mode display driver can accomplish the synchronization by: 
<ul>
<li>
Flushing (that is, calling the runtime's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_rendercb.md">pfnRenderCb</a> callback function) any outstanding commands as necessary.

</li>
<li>
Calling <b>pfnLockCb</b> with the appropriate allocation handle for commands that have already been submitted to hardware. 

</li>
</ul>The user-mode display driver returns a pointer to the memory for the locked surface and the pitch of the surface in the <b>pSurfData</b> and <b>Pitch</b> members of the D3DDDIARG_LOCK structure. However, for preallocated system memory surfaces, the runtime ignores the driver-set memory and pitch, although the driver can still fail the <i>Lock</i> call (and thus fail back to the application). The runtime sets the <b>NotifyOnly</b> bit-field flag in the <b>Flags</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_lock.md">D3DDDIARG_LOCK</a> structure to differentiate <i>Lock</i> calls that lock preallocated system memory surfaces from other <i>Lock</i> calls.
