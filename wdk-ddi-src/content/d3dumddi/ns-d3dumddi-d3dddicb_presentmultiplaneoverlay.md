# D3DDDICB_PRESENTMULTIPLANEOVERLAY structure
Describes multiplane overlay allocations that content is copied to and from.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct D3DDDICB_PRESENTMULTIPLANEOVERLAY {
  HANDLE                            hContext;
  UINT                              BroadcastContextCount;
  HANDLE                            BroadcastContext[D3DDDI_MAX_BROADCAST_CONTEXT];
  UINT                              AllocationInfoCount;
  D3DDDI_MULTIPLANE_ALLOCATION_INFO AllocationInfo[D3DDDI_MAX_MULTIPLANE_OVERLAY_ALLOCATIONS];
} D3DDDICB_PRESENTMULTIPLANEOVERLAY;
````

## Members


`AllocationInfo`

An array of structures of type <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-d3dddi_multiplane_overlay_allocation_info.md">D3DDDI_MULTIPLANE_ALLOCATION_INFO</a> that specify info about the multiplane overlay allocations.

`AllocationInfoCount`

[in] The number of allocations in the array that the <b>AllocationInfo</b> member specifies. The maximum number is 16, the value of the <b>D3DDDI_MAX_MULTIPLANE_OVERLAY_ALLOCATIONS</b> constant.

`BroadcastContext`

[in] An array of handles to the additional contexts to broadcast the current present operation to. The <b>D3DDDI_MAX_BROADCAST_CONTEXT</b> constant, which is defined as 64, defines the maximum number of additional contexts that the user-mode display driver can broadcast the current present operation to. 

Broadcasting is supported only for flip operations. To broadcast a flip operation, the display miniport driver must support memory mapped I/O (MMIO)-based flips. To indicate support of MMIO flips, the display miniport driver sets the <b>FlipOnVSyncMmIo</b> bit-field flag in the <b>FlipCaps</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_drivercaps.md">DXGK_DRIVERCAPS</a> structure when its <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_queryadapterinfo.md">DxgkDdiQueryAdapterInfo</a> function is called.

The original context that the <b>hContext</b> member specifies and that the user-mode display driver presents to is not an element in the <b>BroadcastContext</b> array. For example, if the <b>BroadcastContext</b> array contains one element, the user-mode display driver sends the present operation to the owning context (<b>hContext</b>) and broadcasts to that one additional context.

`BroadcastContextCount`

[in] The number of additional contexts in the array that the <b>BroadcastContext</b> member specifies.

`hContext`

[in] A handle to the context that the driver submits the copy operation to. The user-mode display driver previously created this context by calling the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f3f5d6bc-3bc6-4214-830a-cffff01069cc">pfnCreateContextCb</a> function.
