## -struct-fields

### -field hContext

[in] A handle to the context that the driver submits the copy operation to. The user-mode display driver previously created this context by calling the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f3f5d6bc-3bc6-4214-830a-cffff01069cc">pfnCreateContextCb</a> function.


### -field BroadcastContextCount

[in] The number of additional contexts in the array that the <b>BroadcastContext</b> member specifies.


### -field BroadcastContext

[in] An array of handles to the additional contexts to broadcast the current present operation to. The <b>D3DDDI_MAX_BROADCAST_CONTEXT</b> constant, which is defined as 64, defines the maximum number of additional contexts that the user-mode display driver can broadcast the current present operation to. 

Broadcasting is supported only for flip operations. To broadcast a flip operation, the display miniport driver must support memory mapped I/O (MMIO)-based flips. To indicate support of MMIO flips, the display miniport driver sets the <b>FlipOnVSyncMmIo</b> bit-field flag in the <b>FlipCaps</b> member of the <a href="display.dxgk_drivercaps">DXGK_DRIVERCAPS</a> structure when its <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_queryadapterinfo.md">DxgkDdiQueryAdapterInfo</a> function is called.

The original context that the <b>hContext</b> member specifies and that the user-mode display driver presents to is not an element in the <b>BroadcastContext</b> array. For example, if the <b>BroadcastContext</b> array contains one element, the user-mode display driver sends the present operation to the owning context (<b>hContext</b>) and broadcasts to that one additional context. 


### -field AllocationInfoCount

[in] The number of allocations in the array that the <b>AllocationInfo</b> member specifies. The maximum number is 16, the value of the <b>D3DDDI_MAX_MULTIPLANE_OVERLAY_ALLOCATIONS</b> constant.


### -field AllocationInfo

An array of structures of type <a href="display.d3dddi_multiplane_allocation_info">D3DDDI_MULTIPLANE_ALLOCATION_INFO</a> that specify info about the multiplane overlay allocations.
