# _D3DDDIARG_GENERATEMIPSUBLEVELS structure
The D3DDDIARG_GENERATEMIPSUBLEVELS structure describes how to generate the sublevels of a MIP-map texture.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DDDIARG_GENERATEMIPSUBLEVELS {
  HANDLE                  hResource;
  D3DDDITEXTUREFILTERTYPE Filter;
} D3DDDIARG_GENERATEMIPSUBLEVELS;
````

## Members


`Filter`

[in] A D3DDDITEXTUREFILTERTYPE-typed value that indicates the texture magnification or minification filter type that is used in generating the sublevels of the MIP-map texture. This member can be one of the following values.
<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DDDITEXF_NONE

</td>
<td>
MIP-map filtering is disabled.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DDDITEXF_POINT

</td>
<td>
Point filtering. The texel with coordinates that are nearest to the required pixel value is used. The texture filter to be used between MIP-map levels is nearest-point MIP-map filtering.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DDDITEXF_LINEAR

</td>
<td>
Bilinear-interpolation filtering. A weighted average of a 2x2 area of texels that surround the required pixel is used. The texture filter to use between MIP-map levels is trilinear MIP-map interpolation. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DDDITEXF_ANISOTROPIC

</td>
<td>
Anisotropic texture filtering. This filtering compensates for distortion that is caused by the difference in angle between the texture polygon and the plane of the screen.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DDDITEXF_PYRAMIDALQUAD

</td>
<td>
Four-sample tent filtering.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DDDITEXF_GAUSSIANQUAD

</td>
<td>
Four-sample Gaussian filtering.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`hResource`

[in] A handle to the MIP-map texture surface.
