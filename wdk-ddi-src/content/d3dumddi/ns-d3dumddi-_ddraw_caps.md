# _DDRAW_CAPS structure
The DDRAW_CAPS structure describes general Microsoft DirectDraw capabilities that the user-mode display driver supports.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DDRAW_CAPS {
  UINT Caps;
  UINT Caps2;
  UINT CKeyCaps;
  UINT FxCaps;
  UINT MaxVideoPorts;
} DDRAW_CAPS;
````

## Members


`Caps`

[out] A valid bitwise OR of the following general capability bits that the driver supports.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Capability bit</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DDRAW_CAPS_ZBLTS

</td>
<td>
Z-buffers can be used in bit-block transfer (bitblt) operations.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DDRAW_CAPS_COLORKEY

</td>
<td>
Some form of color key can be used in either overlay or bitblt operations. For more specific color key capability information, see the <b>CKeyCaps</b> member.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DDRAW_CAPS_BLTDEPTHFILL

</td>
<td>
Z-buffers can be depth-filled in bitblt operations.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`Caps2`

[out] A valid bitwise OR of more of the following general capability bits that the driver supports.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Capability bit</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DDRAW_CAPS2_VIDEOPORT

</td>
<td>
A hardware video port can be used.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DDRAW_CAPS2_CANDROPZ16BIT

</td>
<td>
Sixteen-bit RGBZ values can be converted into 16-bit RGB values. (The system does not support 8-bit conversions.)

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DDRAW_CAPS2_FLIPINTERVAL

</td>
<td>
The driver responds to the <b>Flip</b> bit-field flag.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DDRAW_CAPS2_FLIPNOVSYNC

</td>
<td>
The driver responds to the <b>FlipWithNoWait</b> bit-field flag.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DDRAW_CAPS2_DYNAMICTEXTURES

</td>
<td>
The driver supports dynamic textures.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`CKeyCaps`

[out] A valid bitwise OR of the following color key capability bits that the driver supports.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Capability bit</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DDRAW_CKEYCAPS_SRCBLT

</td>
<td>
Transparent bit-block transfers can be performed with a color key that identifies bits of the source surface that are copied to the destination surface.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DDRAW_CKEYCAPS_DESTBLT

</td>
<td>
Transparent bit-block transfers (bitblts) can be performed with a color key that identifies the replaceable bits of the destination surface.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`FxCaps`

[out] A valid bitwise OR of the following stretching and effects capability bits that the driver supports.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Capability bit</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DDRAW_FXCAPS_BLTMIRRORLEFTRIGHT

</td>
<td>
Bit-block transfers (bitblts) that flip the contents of the source surface to the destination surface horizontally along the center axis can be performed.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DDRAW_FXCAPS_BLTMIRRORUPDOWN

</td>
<td>
Bit-block transfers (bitblts) that flip the contents of the source surface to the destination surface vertically along the center axis can be performed.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`MaxVideoPorts`

[out] The maximum number of video ports that the device supports.
