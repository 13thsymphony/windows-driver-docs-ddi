# PFND3DDDI_CRYPTOSESSIONKEYEXCHANGE callback



## -description
The <b>CryptoSessionKeyExchange</b> function negotiates a session key. 



## -prototype

````
PFND3DDDI_CRYPTOSESSIONKEYEXCHANGE CryptoSessionKeyExchange;

__checkReturn HRESULT APIENTRY CryptoSessionKeyExchange(
  _In_    HANDLE                             hDevice,
  _Inout_ D3DDDIARG_CRYPTOSESSIONKEYEXCHANGE *pData
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hDevice [in]

 A handle to the display device (graphics context).


### -param pData [in, out]

 A pointer to a <a href="display.d3dddiarg_cryptosessionkeyexchange">D3DDDIARG_CRYPTOSESSIONKEYEXCHANGE</a> structure that describes a session key that is used for encryption. 


## -returns
<b>CryptoSessionKeyExchange</b> returns one of the following values:
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The session key is successfully exchanged. 
<dl>
<dt><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b></dt>
</dl>
<a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_cryptosessionkeyexchange.md">CryptoSessionKeyExchange</a> could not allocate the required memory for it to complete.

 


## -remarks
The driver should only support a single key exchange mechanism for each encryption type. Microsoft has standardized the key exchange type D3DKEYEXCHANGE_RSAES_OAEP. However, hardware vendors can use proprietary key exchange mechanisms. 

For D3DKEYEXCHANGE_RSAES_OAEP, the <b>pData</b> member of the <a href="display.d3dddiarg_cryptosessionkeyexchange">D3DDDIARG_CRYPTOSESSIONKEYEXCHANGE</a> structure points to a buffer that contains the session key that an application previously RSAES-OAEP-encrypted with the public key from the driver's crypto session certificate. The actual size of the buffer is 256 bytes. This exchange is identical to how the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2c138dbd-55ca-4c71-8c8b-b2efd1ca80f2">Output Protection Manager</a> (OPM) key exchange works, except the OPM buffer contains additional data besides the session key. The same certificate that is used for OPM key exchange can be used for the D3DKEYEXCHANGE_RSAES_OAEP key exchange.
