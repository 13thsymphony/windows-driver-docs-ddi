# PFND3DDDI_FLUSH callback



## -description
<p>The <i>Flush</i> function submits outstanding hardware commands that are in the hardware command buffer to the display miniport driver.</p>


## -prototype

````
PFND3DDDI_FLUSH Flush;

__checkReturn HRESULT APIENTRY Flush(
  _In_ HANDLE hDevice
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters
<dl>

### -param hDevice [in]

<dd>
<p> A handle to the display device (graphics context).</p>
</dd>
</dl>

## -returns
<p><i>Flush</i> returns one of the following values:</p><dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl><p>Hardware commands were successfully flushed.</p><dl>
<dt><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b></dt>
</dl><p><i>Flush</i> could not allocate the required memory for it to complete.</p>

<p> </p>

## -remarks
<p>The Microsoft Direct3D runtime can call the user-mode display driver's <i>Flush</i> function at any time to notify the user-mode display driver to submit any outstanding hardware commands that are in the hardware command buffer to the display miniport driver. However, a call to <i>Flush</i> should never cause the user-mode display driver to submit invalid commands to the display miniport driver. </p>

<p>To submit commands to the display miniport driver, the user-mode display driver's <i>Flush</i> function should typically call the runtime's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi-rendercb.md">pfnRenderCb</a> function.</p>
