# PFND3DDDI_OPENRESOURCE callback



## -description
The <i>OpenResource</i> function informs the driver that a shared resource is opened.



## -prototype

````
PFND3DDDI_OPENRESOURCE OpenResource;

__checkReturn HRESULT APIENTRY OpenResource(
  _In_    HANDLE                 hDevice,
  _Inout_ D3DDDIARG_OPENRESOURCE *pResource
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hDevice [in]

 A handle to the display device (graphics context) that is used to open the resource.


### -param pResource [in, out]

 A pointer to a <a href="display.d3dddiarg_openresource">D3DDDIARG_OPENRESOURCE</a> structure that describes the resource that is opened.


## -returns
<i>OpenResource</i> returns S_OK or an appropriate error result if the resource is not successfully opened.


## -remarks
The Microsoft Direct3D runtime calls the user-mode display driver's <i>OpenResource</i> function to inform the user-mode display driver that a shared resource is opened. The driver should store any information that is required to describe the resource and return a unique handle in the <b>hResource</b> member of the D3DDDIARG_OPENRESOURCE structure (pointed to by the <i>pResource</i> parameter) that identifies the new resource in subsequent calls that the Direct3D runtime makes to the driver. The private driver data that is passed to <i>OpenResource</i> is the same private driver data that was passed to the display miniport driver's <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_createallocation.md">DxgkDdiCreateAllocation</a> function when the resource was created.

For more information about creating and destroying resources, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d443bdc3-1c5a-4372-9e6a-b8a4d21499b9">Handling Resource Creation and Destruction</a>.
