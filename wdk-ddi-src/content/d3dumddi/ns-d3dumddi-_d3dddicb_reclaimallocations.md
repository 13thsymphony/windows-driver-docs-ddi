# _D3DDDICB_RECLAIMALLOCATIONS structure
Describes video memory resources that are to be reclaimed and that the user-mode display driver  previously offered  for reuse. Used with the  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451695">pfnReclaimAllocationsCb</a> function.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DDDICB_RECLAIMALLOCATIONS {
  const HANDLE        *pResources;
  const D3DKMT_HANDLE *HandleList;
  BOOL                *pDiscarded;
  UINT                NumAllocations;
} D3DDDICB_RECLAIMALLOCATIONS;
````

## Members


`HandleList`

[in] An array of D3DKMT_HANDLE data types that represent kernel-mode handles to the allocations that are to be reclaimed.

If <b>HandleList</b> is not <b>NULL</b>, the <b>pResources</b> member must be <b>NULL</b>.

`NumAllocations`

[in] The number of items in the <b>pResources</b>, <b>HandleList</b>, or  <b>pDiscarded</b> members, whichever is not <b>NULL</b>.

`pDiscarded`

[out] An  array of Boolean values that specify whether each resource or allocation was discarded.

Each Boolean value in this array corresponds to a resource at the same index location in the arrays pointed to by <b>pResources</b> or   <b>HandleList.</b>

The DirectX graphics kernel subsystem sets each Boolean value to <b>TRUE</b> if the correponding resource was discarded, or to <b>FALSE</b> if not.

The value of <b>pDiscarded</b> can be <b>NULL</b>. If the driver sets it to <b>NULL</b>, the content of the resource or allocation can be assumed to be lost. If the driver does not need the content of the resource or allocation, setting <b>pDiscarded</b> to <b>NULL</b> might improve performance.

`pResources`

[in] A pointer to an array of handles to the resources that are to be reclaimed.

If <b>pResources</b> is not <b>NULL</b>, the <b>HandleList</b> member must be <b>NULL</b>.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  If resources were created with the <b>D3D10_DDI_BIND_PRESENT</b> flag value set in <i>pCreateResource</i>-&gt;<b>BindFlags</b>, the driver must not use the <b>pResources</b> member to reclaim by resource handles. Instead, the driver must reclaim the resources by using allocation handles specified by <b>HandleList</b>.</div><div> </div>
