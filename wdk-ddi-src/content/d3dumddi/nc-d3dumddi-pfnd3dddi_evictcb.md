# PFND3DDDI_EVICTCB callback function
<b>pfnEvictCb</b> is used to instruct the OS to decrement the residency reference count. Once this count reaches zero, it will remove the allocation from the device residency list.

## Syntax

```
PFND3DDDI_EVICTCB Pfnd3dddiEvictcb;

HRESULT Pfnd3dddiEvictcb(
  HANDLE hDevice,
  D3DDDICB_EVICT *
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`hDevice`

A handle to the display device.

`*`




## Return Value

If this callback function succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.

## Remarks

Once the eviction request is queued, it is illegal to access the underlying allocation as the allocation may be evicted at anytime from there on at the operating system discretion.
