# PFND3DDDI_EVICTCB callback



## -description
<b>pfnEvictCb</b> is used to instruct the OS to decrement the residency reference count. Once this count reaches zero, it will remove the allocation from the device residency list.



## -prototype

````
PFND3DDDI_EVICTCB pfnEvictCb;

HRESULT APIENTRY CALLBACK* pfnEvictCb(
  _In_    HANDLE         hDevice,
  _Inout_ D3DDDICB_EVICT *pData
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hDevice [in]

A handle to the display device.


### -param pData [in, out]

A pointer to a <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-d3dddicb_evict.md">D3DDDICB_EVICT</a> structure that describes the memory pages to evict.




## -returns
If this callback function succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.
