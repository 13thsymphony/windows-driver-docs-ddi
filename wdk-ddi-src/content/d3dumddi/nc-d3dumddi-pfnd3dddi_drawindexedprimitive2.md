# PFND3DDDI_DRAWINDEXEDPRIMITIVE2 callback



## -description
The <b>DrawIndexedPrimitive2</b> function draws indexed primitives that the Microsoft Direct3D runtime has transformed the index data in.



## -prototype

````
PFND3DDDI_DRAWINDEXEDPRIMITIVE2 DrawIndexedPrimitive2;

__checkReturn HRESULT APIENTRY DrawIndexedPrimitive2(
  _In_           HANDLE                          hDevice,
  _In_     const D3DDDIARG_DRAWINDEXEDPRIMITIVE2 *pData,
  _In_           UINT                            dwIndicesSize,
  _In_     const VOID                            *pIndexBuffer,
  _In_opt_ const UINT                            *pFlagBuffer
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hDevice [in]

 A handle to the display device (graphics context).


### -param pData [in]

 A pointer to a <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_drawindexedprimitive2.md">D3DDDIARG_DRAWINDEXEDPRIMITIVE2</a> structure that describes the primitive to draw.


### -param dwIndicesSize [in]

 The size, in bytes, of indexes in the buffer that <i>pIndexBuffer</i> points to. This size is 2 or 4 bytes. 


### -param pIndexBuffer [in]

 A pointer to a buffer of index data to be drawn.


### -param pFlagBuffer [in, optional]

 A pointer to a 32-bit value that contains triangle-edge flags, which are used only during line-fill mode. The first three bits (0/1/2) of the 32-bit value specify how the three edges of the corresponding triangle are rendered. If a bit is set to 1, its associated triangle edge is rendered; otherwise, the edge is not rendered.

If the pointer is <b>NULL</b>, the user-mode display driver should use its fast path to draw primitives. 


## -returns
<b>DrawIndexedPrimitive2</b> returns S_OK or an appropriate error result if the primitive is not successfully drawn.


## -remarks
Stream zero contains transform indices and is the only stream that should be accessed. 

When the Microsoft Direct3D runtime specifies triangle-edge flags in the value that the <i>pFlagBuffer</i> parameter points to, the runtime also specifies to draw only one triangle (that is, the runtime specifies the D3DPT_TRIANGLELIST value in the <b>PrimitiveType</b> member and 0x00000001 in the <b>PrimitiveCount</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_drawindexedprimitive2.md">D3DDDIARG_DRAWINDEXEDPRIMITIVE2</a> structure that the <i>pData</i> parameter points to).
