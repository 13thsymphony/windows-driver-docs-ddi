# _DXVADDI_FREQUENCY structure
The DXVADDI_FREQUENCY structure describes the video frame rate in Hertz (Hz). For example, NTSC TV is 60000 over 1001.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DXVADDI_FREQUENCY {
  UINT Numerator;
  UINT Denominator;
} DXVADDI_FREQUENCY;
````

## Members


`Denominator`

[in] The denominator of the frequency fraction.

`Numerator`

[in] The numerator of the frequency fraction.

## Remarks
The user-mode display driver must interpret the video frame rate for the following special cases as indicated:

<ul>
<li>
<b>Numerator</b>/<b>Denominator</b> = 0/0 is interpreted as an unknown frequency.

</li>
<li>
<b>Numerator</b>/<b>Denominator</b> = n/0, where n is any number, is interpreted as invalid.

</li>
<li>
<b>Numerator</b>/<b>Denominator</b> = 0/n is interpreted as zero frequency.

</li>
</ul>

## Requirements

| **Windows version** | Available in Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating systems. Available in Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating systems. |
