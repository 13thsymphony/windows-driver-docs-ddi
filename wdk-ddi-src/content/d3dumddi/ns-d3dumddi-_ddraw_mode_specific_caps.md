  UINT Head;
  UINT Caps;
  UINT CKeyCaps;
  UINT FxCaps;
  UINT MaxVisibleOverlays;
  UINT MinOverlayStretch;

## Members


`Caps`

[out] A valid bitwise OR of the following general capability bits that the driver supports.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Capability bit</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
MODE_CAPS_OVERLAY (0x00000001)

</td>
<td>
Overlay operations can be performed.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
MODE_CAPS_OVERLAYSTRETCH (0x00000002)

</td>
<td>
Overlay operations can be performed simultaneously with stretching.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
MODE_CAPS_CANBOBINTERLEAVED (0x00000004)

</td>
<td>
The overlay hardware can display each field of an interlaced video stream individually while it is interleaved in memory without causing any artifacts that might typically occur without special hardware support. This option is valid only when the surface is receiving data from a VPE object and is valid only when the video is zoomed at least 200 percent in the vertical direction.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
MODE_CAPS_CANBOBNONINTERLEAVED (0x00000008)

</td>
<td>
The overlay hardware can display each field of an interlaced video stream individually while it is not interleaved in memory without causing any artifacts that might typically occur without special hardware support. This option is valid only when the surface is receiving data from a VPE object and is valid only when the video is zoomed at least 200 percent in the vertical direction.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
MODE_CAPS_CANFLIPODDEVEN (0x00000010)

</td>
<td>
The driver supports bob-style deinterlacing that uses software without using a VPE object.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
MODE_CAPS_READSCANLINE (0x00000020)

</td>
<td>
The current scan line can be read and returned.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
MODE_CAPS_COLORCONTROLOVERLAY (0x00000040)

</td>
<td>
The driver supports color-control settings for an overlay.

`Head`

[in] The display device (head) on the multiple-head graphics card to retrieve capabilities about.

`MaxOverlayStretch`

[out] The maximum overlay stretch factor multiplied by 1000. For example, a factor of 1.3 should be stored as 1300. The display driver must set the maximum factor to the actual maximum to which the graphics hardware can stretch the overlay. If the graphics hardware has no maximum limitation, set <b>MaxOverlayStretch</b> to 32000.

`MaxVisibleOverlays`

[out] The maximum number of visible overlays.

`MinOverlayStretch`

[out] The minimum overlay stretch factor multiplied by 1000. For example, a factor of 1.3 should be stored as 1300. The display driver must set the minimum factor to the actual minimum to which the graphics hardware can shrink the overlay. If the graphics hardware has no minimum limitation, set <b>MinOverlayStretch</b> to 1.

## Remarks
Capabilities can change between heads of a multiple-headed graphics card and can change after a display mode change.
