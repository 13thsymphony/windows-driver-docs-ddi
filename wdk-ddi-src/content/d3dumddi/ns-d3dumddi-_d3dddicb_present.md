# _D3DDDICB_PRESENT structure
The D3DDDICB_PRESENT structure describes allocations that content is copied to and from.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DDDICB_PRESENT {
  D3DKMT_HANDLE hSrcAllocation;
  D3DKMT_HANDLE hDstAllocation;
  HANDLE        hContext;
  UINT          BroadcastContextCount;
  HANDLE        BroadcastContext[D3DDDI_MAX_BROADCAST_CONTEXT];
} D3DDDICB_PRESENT;
````

## Members


`bOptimizeForComposition`



`BroadcastContext`

[in] An array of handles to the additional contexts to broadcast the current present operation to. The D3DDDI_MAX_BROADCAST_CONTEXT constant, which is defined as 64, defines the maximum number of additional contexts that the user-mode display driver can broadcast the current present operation to. 

Broadcasting is supported only for flip operations. To broadcast a flip operation, the display miniport driver must support memory mapped I/O (MMIO)-based flips. To indicate support of MMIO flips, the display miniport driver sets the <b>FlipOnVSyncMmIo</b> bit-field flag in the <b>FlipCaps</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_drivercaps.md">DXGK_DRIVERCAPS</a> structure when its <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_queryadapterinfo.md">DxgkDdiQueryAdapterInfo</a> function is called.

The original context that the <b>hContext</b> member specifies and that the user-mode display driver presents to is not an element in the <b>BroadcastContext</b> array. For example, if the <b>BroadcastContext</b> array contains one element, the user-mode display driver sends the present operation to the owning context (<b>hContext</b>) and broadcasts to that one additional context.

`BroadcastContextCount`

[in] The number of additional contexts in the array that the <b>BroadcastContext</b> member specifies.

`BroadcastDstAllocation`



`BroadcastSrcAllocation`



`hContext`

[in] A handle to the context that the driver submits the copy operation to. The user-mode display driver previously created this context by calling the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f3f5d6bc-3bc6-4214-830a-cffff01069cc">pfnCreateContextCb</a> function.

`hDstAllocation`

[in] A D3DKMT_HANDLE data type that represents a kernel-mode handle to the destination allocation. <b>hDstAllocation</b> can be zero if the destination is unknown; kernel mode will determine the destination just before DMA of the hardware command stream to the graphics processor.

`hSrcAllocation`

[in] A D3DKMT_HANDLE data type that represents a kernel-mode handle to the source allocation. The Microsoft Direct3D runtime's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_allocatecb.md">pfnAllocateCb</a> function returns this handle. Therefore, the user-mode display driver should use this handle to copy content from.

`pPrivateDriverData`



`PrivateDriverDataSize`



`SyncIntervalOverride`



`SyncIntervalOverrideValid`
