## Members


`SimpleInstancingSupported`

Specifies whether the hardware and the user-mode driver support simple instancing. The Direct3D runtime sets this member to <b>TRUE</b> if the hardware and driver support simple instancing and the driver is a Direct3D Level 9 driver and supports Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) 1.3 and later. Otherwise this member is <b>FALSE</b>.

Used only by Direct3D Level 9 drivers that support WDDM 1.3 and later.

Supported starting with Windows 8.1.

## Remarks
Instancing capabilities are exposed through the <b>D3DDDICAPS_GET_SIMPLE_INSTANCING_SUPPORT</b> constant value of the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ne-d3dumddi-_d3dddicaps_type.md">D3DDDICAPS_TYPE</a> enumeration.
