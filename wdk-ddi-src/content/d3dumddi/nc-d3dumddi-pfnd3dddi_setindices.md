# PFND3DDDI_SETINDICES callback



## -description
The <i>SetIndices</i> function sets the current index buffer. 


## -prototype

````
PFND3DDDI_SETINDICES SetIndices;

__checkReturn HRESULT APIENTRY SetIndices(
  _In_       HANDLE               hDevice,
  _In_ const D3DDDIARG_SETINDICES *pData
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hDevice [in]

 A handle to the display device (graphics context).

### -param pData [in]

 A pointer to a <a href="display.d3dddiarg_setindices">D3DDDIARG_SETINDICES</a> structure that describes parameters for setting the current index buffer.

## -returns
<i>SetIndices</i> returns S_OK or an appropriate error result if the index buffer is not successfully set.

## -remarks
The Microsoft Direct3D runtime supplies a handle value of zero in the <b>hIndexBuffer</b> member of the <a href="display.d3dddiarg_setindices">D3DDDIARG_SETINDICES</a> structure that is pointed to by the <i>pData</i> parameter to clear the current index buffer. The driver should handle subsequent attempts to draw indexed primitives (before a new current index buffer is established) so that a crash does not occur. The debug version of your driver should display informative messages to the debug output stream when this error condition is detected.
