# _D3DDDIARG_OPENADAPTER structure
The D3DDDIARG_OPENADAPTER structure contains information that describes the graphics adapter object.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DDDIARG_OPENADAPTER {
  HANDLE                        hAdapter;
  UINT                          Interface;
  UINT                          Version;
  const D3DDDI_ADAPTERCALLBACKS *pAdapterCallbacks;

  UINT                          DriverVersion;
} D3DDDIARG_OPENADAPTER;

## Members


`DriverVersion`

[out] The version of the Direct3D user-mode display driver's interface, which was obtained from the <i>D3dumddi.h</i> header file, that the driver was compiled with. The user-mode display driver should return D3D_UMD_INTERFACE_VERSION. 
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  If a user-mode driver does not support Windows 7 features (DXGKDDI_INTERFACE_VERSION &lt; DXGKDDI_INTERFACE_VERSION_WIN7), and you want to compile the driver
with the Windows 7 WDK (Version 7600), make sure that the driver returns D3D_UMD_INTERFACE_VERSION_VISTA.</div><div> </div>

`hAdapter`

[in/out] A handle to the graphics adapter object. On input to the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_openadapter.md">OpenAdapter</a> function, <b>hAdapter</b> specifies the handle that the driver should use to query for graphics adapter capabilities when the driver calls the Microsoft Direct3D runtime-supplied <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_queryadapterinfocb.md">pfnQueryAdapterInfoCb</a> callback function. 

The driver generates a unique handle and passes it back to the Direct3D runtime. On output from the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_openadapter.md">OpenAdapter</a> function, <b>hAdapter</b> specifies the handle that the Direct3D runtime uses in subsequent driver calls to identify the graphics adapter object.

`Interface`

[in] The Direct3D/DirectDraw interface version (for example, 7, 8, or 9) that opens the graphics adapter.

`pAdapterCallbacks`

[in] A pointer to a <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddi_adaptercallbacks.md">D3DDDI_ADAPTERCALLBACKS</a> structure that contains the Direct3D runtime-supplied <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_queryadapterinfocb.md">pfnQueryAdapterInfoCb</a> callback function that the driver can use.

`pAdapterFuncs`

[out] A pointer to a <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddi_adapterfuncs.md">D3DDDI_ADAPTERFUNCS</a> structure that contains a table of user-mode display driver adapter-specific functions. The Direct3D runtime uses these functions to communicate with the user-mode display driver about operations that are specific to the graphics adapter.

`Version`

[in] A number that the driver can use to identify when the Direct3D/DirectDraw runtime was built. For example, the driver can use the version number to differentiate between a runtime that is released with Windows Vista and a runtime that is released with a subsequent service pack, which might contain a fix that the driver requires.
