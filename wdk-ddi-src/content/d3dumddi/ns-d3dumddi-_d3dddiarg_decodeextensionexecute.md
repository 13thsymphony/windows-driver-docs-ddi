# _D3DDDIARG_DECODEEXTENSIONEXECUTE structure



## -description
The D3DDDIARG_DECODEEXTENSIONEXECUTE structure describes a nonstandard Microsoft DirectX Video Acceleration (VA) decode operation to perform.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _D3DDDIARG_DECODEEXTENSIONEXECUTE {
  HANDLE                hDecode;
  UINT                  Function;
  DXVADDI_PRIVATEDATA   *pPrivateInput;
  DXVADDI_PRIVATEDATA   *pPrivateOutput;
  UINT                  NumBuffers;
  DXVADDI_PRIVATEBUFFER *pBuffers;
} D3DDDIARG_DECODEEXTENSIONEXECUTE;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field hDecode

[in] A handle to the DirectX VA decode device. The user-mode display driver returns this handle in a call to its <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_createdecodedevice.md">CreateDecodeDevice</a> function.


### -field Function

[in] A specific decode operation to perform. The possible values for this member are defined by the nonstandard decode device.


### -field pPrivateInput

[in] A pointer to a <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_dxvaddi_privatedata.md">DXVADDI_PRIVATEDATA</a> structure that contains data that the driver requires to perform the decode operation.


### -field pPrivateOutput

[out] A pointer to a DXVADDI_PRIVATEDATA structure that contains data about the decode operation that the driver returns.


### -field NumBuffers

[in] The number of buffers in the list that is pointed to by <b>pBuffers</b>.


### -field pBuffers


      [in] A pointer to a list of <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_dxvaddi_privatebuffer.md">DXVADDI_PRIVATEBUFFER</a> structures that describe private buffers that a nonstandard decoder uses to perform a decode operation.
