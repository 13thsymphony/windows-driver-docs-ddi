# PFND3DDDI_DELETEVERTEXSHADERDECL callback function
The <b>DeleteVertexShaderDecl</b> function cleans up driver-side resources that are associated with the vertex shader declaration.

## Syntax

```
PFND3DDDI_DELETEVERTEXSHADERDECL Pfnd3dddiDeletevertexshaderdecl;

HRESULT Pfnd3dddiDeletevertexshaderdecl(
  HANDLE hDevice,
   HANDLE
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`hDevice`

A handle to the display device (graphics context).

`HANDLE`




## Return Value

<b>DeleteVertexShaderDecl</b> returns S_OK or an appropriate error result if the vertex shader declaration object is not successfully cleaned up.

## Remarks

The <b>DeleteVertexShaderDecl</b> function notifies the driver about the deletion of the vertex shader declaration object that the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_createvertexshaderdecl.md">CreateVertexShaderDecl</a> function created. The driver can then clean up any driver-side resources that are associated with the vertex shader declaration.
