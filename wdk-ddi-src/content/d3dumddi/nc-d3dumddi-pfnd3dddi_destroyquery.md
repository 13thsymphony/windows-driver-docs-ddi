# PFND3DDDI_DESTROYQUERY callback



## -description
The <b>DestroyQuery</b> function releases resources for a query.



## -prototype

````
PFND3DDDI_DESTROYQUERY DestroyQuery;

__checkReturn HRESULT APIENTRY DestroyQuery(
  _In_       HANDLE hDevice,
  _In_ const HANDLE hQuery
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hDevice [in]

 A handle to the display device (graphics context).


### -param hQuery [in]

 A handle to the query that the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_createquery.md">CreateQuery</a> function created.


## -returns
<b>DestroyQuery</b> returns S_OK or an appropriate error result if the resources are not released. 


## -remarks
The <b>DestroyQuery</b> function notifies the driver to destroy the query handle that the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_createquery.md">CreateQuery</a> function previously created. The driver can then release resources that are associated with the query handle.
