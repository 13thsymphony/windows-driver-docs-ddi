## -struct-fields

### -field BrightnessSetting

[in] An INT value that specifies the brightness of the output image as it is written to the overlay. This member is set if the <b>Brightness</b> bit-field flag is set in the <b>Flags</b> member.


### -field ContrastSetting

[in] An INT value that specifies the contrast of the output image as it is written to the overlay. This member is set if the <b>Contrast</b> bit-field flag is set in the <b>Flags</b> member.


### -field HueSetting

[in] An INT value that specifies the hue of the output image as it is written to the overlay. This member is set if the <b>Hue</b> bit-field flag is set in the <b>Flags</b> member.


### -field SaturationSetting

[in] An INT value that specifies the saturation of the output image as it is written to the overlay. This member is set if the <b>Saturation</b> bit-field flag is set in the <b>Flags</b> member.


### -field SharpnessSetting

[in] An INT value that specifies the sharpness of the output image as it is written to the overlay. This member is set if the <b>Sharpness</b> bit-field flag is set in the <b>Flags</b> member.


### -field GammaSetting

[in] An INT value that specifies the gamma setting of the output image as it is written to the overlay. This member is set if the <b>Gamma</b> bit-field flag is set in the <b>Flags</b> member.


### -field ColorEnableSetting

[in] An INT value that specifies the color-enable setting of the output image as it is written to the overlay. This member is set if the <b>ColorEnable</b> bit-field flag is set in the <b>Flags</b> member.


### -field Flags

[in] A <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddi_overlaycolorcontrolsflags.md">D3DDDI_OVERLAYCOLORCONTROLSFLAGS</a> structure that identifies color-control settings that the overlay hardware supports.
