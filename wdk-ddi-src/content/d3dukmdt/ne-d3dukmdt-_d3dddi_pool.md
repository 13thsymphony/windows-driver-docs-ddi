# _D3DDDI_POOL Enumeration
The D3DDDI_POOL enumeration type contains values that identify particular types of memory pool.

## Syntax
````
typedef enum _D3DDDI_POOL { 
  D3DDDIPOOL_SYSTEMMEM       = 1,
  D3DDDIPOOL_VIDEOMEMORY     = 2,
  D3DDDIPOOL_LOCALVIDMEM     = 3,
  D3DDDIPOOL_NONLOCALVIDMEM  = 4,
#if (D3D_UMD_INTERFACE_VERSION >= D3D_UMD_INTERFACE_VERSION_WDDM1_3)
  D3DDDIPOOL_STAGINGMEM      = 5

#endif } D3DDDI_POOL;
````

## Constants

<table>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>D3DDDIPOOL_LOCALVIDMEM</td>
                    <td>Resources exist in true, local display memory rather than nonlocal display memory (for example, AGP memory).</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>D3DDDIPOOL_NONLOCALVIDMEM</td>
                    <td>Resources exist in nonlocal display memory (for example, AGP memory) rather than true, local display memory.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>D3DDDIPOOL_STAGINGMEM</td>
                    <td>Resources exist in staging memory that the user-mode display driver has allocated. This value indicates to the driver that it should allocate its own staging memory rather than use allocated Direct3D 10Level 9 memory.

Must be supported by WDDM 1.3 and later drivers. Available starting with Windows 8.1.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>D3DDDIPOOL_SYSTEMMEM</td>
                    <td>Resources exist in system memory.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>D3DDDIPOOL_VIDEOMEMORY</td>
                    <td>Resources exist in display memory.</td>
                </tr>
</table>

    ## Remarks

        Pool memory types are defined as an enumeration type rather than separate flags because the types are all mutually exclusive.

Note that the D3DDDIPOOL_LOCALVIDMEM and D3DDDIPOOL_NONLOCALVIDMEM values are provided as hints to the user-mode display driver so it can improve performance. For more information about these values, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b4691de0-d3c9-4a6f-a9f4-aafb22ea3e97">Specifying Memory Type for a Resource</a>.
