# _D3DDDI_RATIONAL structure
The D3DDDI_RATIONAL structure describes a fractional value that represents vertical and horizontal frequencies of a video mode (that is, vertical sync and horizontal sync).

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DDDI_RATIONAL {
  UINT Numerator;
  UINT Denominator;
} D3DDDI_RATIONAL;
````

## Members


`Denominator`

[in] The denominator of the frequency fraction.

`Numerator`

[in] The numerator of the frequency fraction.

## Remarks
Vertical and horizontal frequencies are stored in Hertz (Hz). 
	 The dynamic range of this encoding format, given 10⁻⁷ 
	 resolution, is {0 to (2³² - 1) / 10⁷}. This 
	 range translates to {0 to 428.4967296} Hz for vertical and horizontal 
	 frequencies. This submicrosecond precision range is acceptable even for 
	 a provided application. (An error of one microsecond for video signal 
	 synchronization would imply a time drift with a cycle of 
	 10⁷/(60 x 60 x 24) = 115.741 days.)

For a rational number with a finite fractional sequence, use a denominator of the form 10<sup>(length of fractional sequence)</sup>. For a rational number without a finite fractional sequence, a sequence that exceeds the precision that the dynamic range of the denominator allows, or an irrational number, use an appropriate ratio of integers that best represents the value.
