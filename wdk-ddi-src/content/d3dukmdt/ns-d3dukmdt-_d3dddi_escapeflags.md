# _D3DDDI_ESCAPEFLAGS structure



## -description
The D3DDDI_ESCAPEFLAGS structure identifies how the user-mode display driver shares information with the display miniport driver.

## -struct-fields

### -field HardwareAccess

A <b>UINT</b> value that specifies whether the operating system performs the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2b7c1eae-6527-469e-a2fa-74d2a1246bd3">second level of synchronization</a> into the display miniport driver for the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_escape.md">DxgkDdiEscape</a> call. If the driver requires the second level of synchronization and the <b>HardwareAccess</b> flag is not set, the call to the driver's <i>DxgkDdiEscape</i> function should fail. 

Starting in Windows 8.1,  if this member is set, <b>DeviceStatusQuery</b> and <b>ChangeFrameLatency</b> must be set to zero.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000001).


### -field DeviceStatusQuery


  
  If set, when the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_escapecb.md">pfnEscapeCb</a> function is called and the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddicb_escape.md">D3DDDICB_ESCAPE</a>.<b>PrivateDriverDataSize</b> member is <code>sizeof(D3DDDI_EXECUTIONSTATEESCAPE)</code>, the Direct3D runtime interprets the <b>D3DDDICB_ESCAPE</b>.<b>pPrivateDriverData</b> member as a pointer to a buffer that contains a <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddi_executionstateescape.md">D3DDDI_EXECUTIONSTATEESCAPE</a> structure. In addition, the runtime processes the <i>pfnEscapeCb</i> as a status query by writing the requested info into the provided buffer instead of sending a <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_escape.md">DxgkDdiEscape</a> call to the display miniport driver.

If this member is set, <b>HardwareAccess</b> and <b>ChangeFrameLatency</b> must be set to zero.

Supported starting with Windows 8.1.

The operating system ignores this member if it is prior to Windows 8.1, or if the user-mode driver was initialized with an <i>OpenAdapterXxx</i> call where the <i>pOpenData</i>-&gt;<b>Interface</b> member indicates Direct3D version 8 or earlier.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the second bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000002).


### -field ChangeFrameLatency


  
  If set, when the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_escapecb.md">pfnEscapeCb</a> function is called, the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddicb_escape.md">D3DDDICB_ESCAPE</a>.<b>PrivateDriverDataSize</b> member is <code>sizeof(D3DDDI_FRAMELATENCYESCAPE)</code> and conditions in Remarks are also met, the Direct3D runtime interprets the <b>D3DDDICB_ESCAPE</b>.<b>pPrivateDriverData</b> member as a pointer to a buffer that contains a <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddi_framelatencyescape.md">D3DDDI_FRAMELATENCYESCAPE</a> structure. In addition, the runtime processes the <i>pfnEscapeCb</i> as a request to change the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem's maximum frame latency by writing the requested info into the provided buffer instead of sending a <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_escape.md">DxgkDdiEscape</a> call to the display miniport driver.

If this member is set, <b>HardwareAccess</b> and <b>DeviceStatusQuery</b> must be set to zero.

Supported starting with Windows 8.1.

The operating system ignores this member if it is prior to Windows 8.1, or if the user-mode driver was initialized with an <i>OpenAdapterXxx</i> call where the <i>pOpenData</i>-&gt;<b>Interface</b> member indicates Direct3D version 8 or earlier.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the third bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000004).


### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member to zero is equivalent to setting the remaining 29 bits (0xFFFFFFF8) of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member to zeros.


### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member to zero is equivalent to setting the remaining 31 bits (0xFFFFFFFE) of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member to zeros.


### -field Value

A member in the union that is contained in D3DDDI_ESCAPEFLAGS that can hold one 32-bit value that identifies how to share information.


## -remarks
If <b>ChangeFrameLatency</b> is set, a <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_escapecb.md">pfnEscapeCb</a> call will succeed only if:

If these conditions are not met, <i>pfnEscapeCb</i> call returns an <b>E_INVALIDARG</b> error code.
