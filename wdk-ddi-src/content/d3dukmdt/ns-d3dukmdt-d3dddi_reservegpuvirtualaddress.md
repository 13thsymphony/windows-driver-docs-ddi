# D3DDDI_RESERVEGPUVIRTUALADDRESS structure

## Members


`BaseAddress`

(Optional) If <b>non-NULL</b>, the video memory manager will attempt to use this address as the base address for the reserved range. If the range from <b>BaseAddress</b> to <b>BaseAddress</b>+<b>Size</b> isn’t free, the call will fail. When this parameter is <b>non-NULL</b>, <b>MinimumAddress</b> and <b>MaximumAddress</b> are ignored.

<b>BaseAddress</b> is in bytes and must be aligned to 64KB boundary.


If <b>NULL</b> is specified the video memory manager will pick the base address for the allocation within the specified <b>MinimumAddress</b> and <b>MaximumAddress</b>.

`MaximumAddress`

(Optional) Specifies the maximum GPU virtual address to consider for the reserved range. the video memory manager will guarantee that <b>BaseAddress</b>+<b>Size</b> &lt;= <b>MaximumAddress</b>. If this is set to NULL the video memory manager will not apply any limit.

<b>MaximumAddress</b> is in bytes and must be aligned to 64KB boundary.

This parameter is ignored when <b>BaseAddress</b> != <b>NULL</b>.

`MinimumAddress`

(Optional) Specifies the minimum GPU virtual address to consider for the reserved range.

<b>MinimumAddress</b> is in bytes and must be aligned to 64KB boundary.

This parameter is ignored when <b>BaseAddress</b> != <b>NULL</b>.

`Size`

Specify the size of the range to reserve in bytes. Must be a multiple of 64KB.

`VirtualAddress`

[out] The reserved virtual address.
