## -struct-fields

### -field hPagingQueue

Paging queue to synchronize the operation on.


### -field hAdapter

DirectX graphics adapter handle. 


### -field BaseAddress

(Optional) If <b>non-NULL</b>, the video memory manager will attempt to use this address as the base address for the reserved range. If the range from <b>BaseAddress</b> to <b>BaseAddress</b>+<b>Size</b> isn’t free, the call will fail. When this parameter is <b>non-NULL</b>, <b>MinimumAddress</b> and <b>MaximumAddress</b> are ignored.

<b>BaseAddress</b> is in bytes and must be aligned to 64KB boundary.


If <b>NULL</b> is specified the video memory manager will pick the base address for the allocation within the specified <b>MinimumAddress</b> and <b>MaximumAddress</b>.



### -field MinimumAddress

(Optional) Specifies the minimum GPU virtual address to consider for the reserved range.

<b>MinimumAddress</b> is in bytes and must be aligned to 64KB boundary.

This parameter is ignored when <b>BaseAddress</b> != <b>NULL</b>.


### -field MaximumAddress

(Optional) Specifies the maximum GPU virtual address to consider for the reserved range. the video memory manager will guarantee that <b>BaseAddress</b>+<b>Size</b> &lt;= <b>MaximumAddress</b>. If this is set to NULL the video memory manager will not apply any limit.

<b>MaximumAddress</b> is in bytes and must be aligned to 64KB boundary.

This parameter is ignored when <b>BaseAddress</b> != <b>NULL</b>.


### -field Size

Specify the size of the range to reserve in bytes. Must be a multiple of 64KB.


### -field ReservationType

Specifies the virtual address reservation type.


### -field Reserved0

This member is reserved and should be set to zero.


### -field DriverProtection

Specifies the driver-specific protection


### -field Reserved1

This member is reserved and should be set to zero.


### -field VirtualAddress

[out] The reserved virtual address.


### -field PagingFenceValue

Paging fence identifier for synchronization


### -field Reserved2

This member is reserved and should be set to zero.
