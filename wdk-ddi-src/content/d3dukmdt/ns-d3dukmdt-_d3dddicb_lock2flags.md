# _D3DDDICB_LOCK2FLAGS structure
<b>D3DDDICB_LOCK2FLAGS</b> is used by the <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtlock2.md">Lock2</a> kernel function to determine how an allocation is locked.
   
  Unlike <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtlock.md">Lock</a>, which supported numerous flags, <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtlock2.md">Lock2</a> has none. The <b>Lock2</b> arguments allow flags to be specified using this structure, but currently it only has a reserved field to allow for capabilities to added in the future.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DDDICB_LOCK2FLAGS {
  union {
    struct {
      UINT Reserved  :32;
    };
    UINT   Value;
  };
} D3DDDICB_LOCK2FLAGS;
