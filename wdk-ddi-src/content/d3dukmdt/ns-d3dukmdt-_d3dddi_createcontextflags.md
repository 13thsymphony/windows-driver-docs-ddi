# _D3DDDI_CREATECONTEXTFLAGS structure



## -description
The D3DDDI_CREATECONTEXTFLAGS structure describes how to create a context in a call to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f3f5d6bc-3bc6-4214-830a-cffff01069cc">pfnCreateContextCb</a> function.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _D3DDDI_CREATECONTEXTFLAGS {
  union {
    struct {
      UINT NullRendering  :1;
      UINT InitialData  :1;
      UINT Reserved  :30;
    };
    UINT   Value;
  };
} D3DDDI_CREATECONTEXTFLAGS;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field NullRendering

A UINT value that specifies whether the graphics processing unit (GPU) should process any commands that are sent by the context that is created. The <b>NullRendering</b> bit-field flag is set to inform the GPU not to process any commands that are sent by the context. The <b>NullRendering</b> bit-field flag is set only during performance investigating and debugging to simulate an infinitely fast rendering engine that still must perform the overhead of DMA buffer submission and signaling. <b>NullRendering</b> is never set during typical operations.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000001).


### -field InitialData

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the second bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000002).


### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member to zero is equivalent to setting the remaining 30 bits (0xFFFFFFFD) of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member to zeros.


### -field Value

A member in the union that is contained in D3DDDI_CREATECONTEXTFLAGS that can hold one 32-bit value that identifies how to create the context.
