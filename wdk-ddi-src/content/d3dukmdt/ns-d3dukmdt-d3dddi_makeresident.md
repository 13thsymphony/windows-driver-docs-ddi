# D3DDDI_MAKERESIDENT structure
<b>D3DDDI_MAKERESIDENT</b> is used with <b>MakeResident</b> (<a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_makeresidentcb.md">pfnMakeResidentCb</a> or <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtmakeresident.md">D3DKMTMakeResident</a>) to instruct the OS to add a resource to the device residency list and increment the residency reference count on this allocation.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct D3DDDI_MAKERESIDENT {
  D3DKMT_HANDLE             hPagingQueue;
  UINT                      NumAllocations;
  const D3DKMT_HANDLE       *AllocationList;
  const UINT                *PriorityList;
  D3DDDI_MAKERESIDENT_FLAGS Flags;
  UINT64                    PagingFenceValue;
  UINT64                    NumBytesToTrim;
} D3DDDI_MAKERESIDENT;
````

## Members


`AllocationList`

[in] An array of <b>NumAllocations</b> allocation handles to make resident. All allocations must be created on the device <b>hPagingQueue</b> is created for.

`Flags`

[in] Specifies memory residency behavior as documented in <a href="..\d3dukmdt\ns-d3dukmdt-d3dddi_makeresident_flags.md">D3DDDI_MAKERESIDENT_FLAGS</a>.

`hPagingQueue`

[in] Paging queue on the device that created the input allocations. This queue will be used for residency operations.

`NumAllocations`

[in/out] On input, the number of allocation handles in the <b>AllocationList</b> array and allocation priority values in the <b>PriorityList</b> array. On output,
                                                    the number of allocations successfully made resident.

`NumBytesToTrim`

[out] When <b>MakeResident</b> returns <b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b>, this member indicates the number of bytes over budget the application would be if the allocation(s) were made resident.

`PagingFenceValue`

[out] When <b>MakeResident</b> returns <b>E_PENDING</b>, this member indicates the paging queue fence value to wait on.

`PriorityList`

[in] An array of <b>NumAllocations</b> specifying residency priority for each of the input allocations. This value is currently ignored and may be set to <b>NULL</b>.
