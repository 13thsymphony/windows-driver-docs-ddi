# IPrintPipelineManagerControl::FilterFinished method



## -description
The <code>FilterFinished</code> method reports that a filter is finished processing.



## -syntax

````
HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE FilterFinished(
  Â  None
);
````


## -parameters

### -param None 


## -returns
<code>FilterFinished</code> returns an <b>HRESULT</b>.


## -remarks
The filter does not need to call the <code>FilterFinished</code> method. The filter pipeline assumes the filter has finished when the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554301">IPrintPipelineFilter::StartOperation</a> method returns. <code>FilterFinished</code> is provided for compatibility and, when called, it does nothing but returns.
