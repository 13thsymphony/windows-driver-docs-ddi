# FilterFinished method
The <code>FilterFinished</code> method reports that a filter is finished processing.

## Syntax

````
HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE FilterFinished(
  Â  None
);
````

## Parameters

This function has no parameters.

## Return Value

<code>FilterFinished</code> returns an <b>HRESULT</b>.

## Remarks

The filter does not need to call the <code>FilterFinished</code> method. The filter pipeline assumes the filter has finished when the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554301">IPrintPipelineFilter::StartOperation</a> method returns. <code>FilterFinished</code> is provided for compatibility and, when called, it does nothing but returns.
