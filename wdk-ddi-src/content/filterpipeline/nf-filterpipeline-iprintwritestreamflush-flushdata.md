# IPrintWriteStreamFlush::FlushData method


## -description


The FlushData method flushes buffered data to a data stream while leaving the stream open, allowing the caller to write additional data to the stream.Writing to the stream is done using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554394">IPrintWriteStream::WriteBytes</a> method.


## -parameters






#### - None

None


## -returns



The FlushData method returns an HRESULT value.




## -remarks



Only the last filter in the print filter pipeline benefits from the flush. The data is flushed to the port monitor. However, the port monitor has the option of using  buffers.


#### Examples

The following code snippet shows how to flush data to a data stream. Note that error checking has been omitted for clarity.
