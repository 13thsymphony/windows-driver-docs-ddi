The <b>IPrintWriteStream</b> interface has these methods.

The <code>Close</code> method closes a stream and ends the writing to that stream. This method is mandatory. You must call this method when the filter is done writing.

The <code>WriteBytes</code> method writes a specified number of bytes to a stream.
