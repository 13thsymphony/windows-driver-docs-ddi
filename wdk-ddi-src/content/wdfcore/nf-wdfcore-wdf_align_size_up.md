# WDF_ALIGN_SIZE_UP function
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]

The <b>WDF_ALIGN_SIZE_UP</b> function returns the next-higher buffer size that is aligned to a specified alignment offset.

## Syntax

````
size_t WDF_ALIGN_SIZE_UP(
  _In_ size_t Length,
  _In_ size_t AlignTo
);
````

## Parameters

`Length`

The length, in bytes, of a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/using-memory-buffers">memory buffer</a>.

`AlignTo`

The alignment offset, in bytes. This value must be a power of 2, such as 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on.


## Return Value

<b>WDF_ALIGN_SIZE_UP</b> returns the aligned buffer size, in bytes.

## Remarks

Drivers can use <b>WDF_ALIGN_SIZE_UP</b> or <a href="..\wdfcore\nf-wdfcore-wdf_align_size_down.md">WDF_ALIGN_SIZE_DOWN</a> to calculate a buffer size that is aligned to a specified alignment offset. This calculation is useful if your driver must allocate multiple contiguous buffers, if each buffer must begin at an address alignment boundary.

If the value of either input parameter is too large, arithmetic overflow causes <b>WDF_ALIGN_SIZE_UP</b> to return an invalid value that is smaller than <i>Length</i>. Your code should test for this condition.


#### Examples

The following code example receives a buffer size and returns the size (either the current size or the next-higher size) that aligns to a DWORD address boundary.

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>bufferSizeAligned = WDF_ALIGN_SIZE_UP(bufferSize,
                                      sizeof(DWORD));
if (bufferSizeAligned &lt; bufferSize)
{
    // Buffer too large.
    ...
}</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
