# WDF_ALIGN_SIZE_DOWN function
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]

The <b>WDF_ALIGN_SIZE_DOWN</b> function returns the next-lower buffer size that is aligned to a specified alignment offset.

## Syntax

````
size_t WDF_ALIGN_SIZE_DOWN(
  _In_ size_t Length,
  _In_ size_t AlignTo
);
````

## Parameters

`Length`

The length, in bytes, of a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/using-memory-buffers">memory buffer</a>.

`AlignTo`

The alignment offset, in bytes. This value must be a power of 2, such as 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on.


## Return Value

WDF_ALIGN_SIZE_DOWN returns the aligned buffer size, in bytes.

## Remarks

Drivers can use <a href="..\wdfcore\nf-wdfcore-wdf_align_size_up.md">WDF_ALIGN_SIZE_UP</a> or <b>WDF_ALIGN_SIZE_DOWN</b> to calculate a buffer size that is aligned to a specified alignment offset. This calculation is useful if your driver must allocate multiple contiguous buffers, if each buffer must begin at an address alignment boundary.
