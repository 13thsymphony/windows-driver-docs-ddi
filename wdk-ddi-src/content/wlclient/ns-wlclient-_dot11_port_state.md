# _DOT11_PORT_STATE structure
<div class="alert"><b>Important</b>  The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560689">Native 802.11 Wireless LAN</a> interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6EF92E34-7BC9-465E-B05D-2BCB29165A18">WLAN Universal Windows driver model</a>.</div><div> </div>The DOT11_PORT_STATE structure defines the port state for a security session with a peer within a
  basic service set (BSS) network. The peer could either be an access point (AP) within an infrastructure BSS
  network, or a peer station within an independent BSS (IBSS) network.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DOT11_PORT_STATE {
  DOT11_MAC_ADDRESS PeerMacAddress;
  ULONG             uSessionId;
  BOOL              bPortControlled;
  BOOL              bPortAuthorized;
} DOT11_PORT_STATE, *PDOT11_PORT_STATE;
````

## Members


`bPortAuthorized`

A Boolean value that defines whether the port is authorized to access the BSS network. A value of
     <b>TRUE</b> specifies that the port has been authorized for network access.
     

For more information about authorized port access, refer to Clause 6.3 of the IEEE 802.1X-1999
     standard.

`bPortControlled`

A Boolean value that defines whether the port is controlled for access to the BSS network. A value
     of <b>TRUE</b> specifies that the port has controlled access to the network.
     

For more information about controlled and uncontrolled port access, refer to Clause 6.3 of the IEEE
     802.1X-1999 standard.

`PeerMacAddress`

The media access control (MAC) address of the AP or peer station with which the security session
     has been initiated.

`uSessionId`

The security session identifier (ID) assigned by the operating system.

## Remarks
The operating system passes in the current port state of the security session through the 
    <i>pPortState</i> parameter of the 
    <mshelp:link keywords="netvista.dot11extihvperformpostassociate" tabindex="0"><i>
    Dot11ExtIhvPerformPostAssociate</i></mshelp:link> IHV handler function. When this function is called, the IHV
    Extensions DLL must not change the data referenced by the 
    <i>pPortState</i> parameter.

## Requirements
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows Driver kit version** |  |
| **Minimum KMDF version** |  |
| **Minimum UMDF version** |  |
| **Header** | wlclient.h (include Wlclient.h) |
