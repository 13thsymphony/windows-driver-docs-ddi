# _DOT11_ADAPTER structure
<div class="alert"><b>Important</b>  The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560689">Native 802.11 Wireless LAN</a> interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6EF92E34-7BC9-465E-B05D-2BCB29165A18">WLAN Universal Windows driver model</a>.</div><div> </div>The DOT11_ADAPTER structure identifies a wireless LAN (WLAN) adapter, as well as the operating
  attributes of the instance of the Native 802.11 miniport driver that manages the adapter.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DOT11_ADAPTER {
  GUID                         gAdapterId;
  LPWSTR                       pszDescription;
  DOT11_CURRENT_OPERATION_MODE Dot11CurrentOpMode;
} DOT11_ADAPTER, *PDOT11_ADAPTER;
````

## Members


`Dot11CurrentOpMode`

The current Native 802.11 operation mode of the miniport driver instance that manages the WLAN
     adapter. The value of 
     <b>Dot11CurrentOpMode</b> is formatted as a 
     <a href="..\windot11\ns-windot11-_dot11_current_operation_mode.md">
     DOT11_CURRENT_OPERATION_MODE</a> value.

`gAdapterId`

The globally unique identifier (GUID) of the WLAN adapter.

## Remarks
The operating system calls the 
    <a href="..\wlanihv\nc-wlanihv-dot11extihv_init_adapter.md">Dot11ExtIhvInitAdapter</a> IHV
    handler function whenever a WLAN adapter becomes available and enabled for use, such as when a PCMCIA
    adapter is inserted. The operating system defines the WLAN adapter by passing in the DOT11_ADAPTER
    structure through the 
    <i>pDot11Adapter</i> parameter of the 
    <i>Dot11ExtIhvInitAdapter</i> function.

## Requirements
