# KeQueryActiveProcessorCount function



## -description
<p>The <b>KeQueryActiveProcessorCount</b> routine returns the number of currently active processors.</p>


## -syntax

````
ULONG KeQueryActiveProcessorCount(
  _Out_opt_Â PKAFFINITY ActiveProcessors
);
````


## -parameters
<dl>

### -param <i>ActiveProcessors</i> [out, optional]

<dd>
<p>A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551830">KAFFINITY</a>-typed variable into which the routine writes a bitmask that represents the set of currently active processors. In a hot-add environment, this mask may change during runtime. This parameter is optional and can be specified as <b>NULL</b> if the caller does not require the mask of active processors. </p>
</dd>
</dl>

## -returns
<p><b>KeQueryActiveProcessorCount</b> returns the number of currently active processors. </p>

## -remarks
<p>A device driver calls the <b>KeQueryActiveProcessorCount</b> routine to retrieve the number of currently active processors. Device drivers that are built for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system should not use the <b>KeNumberProcessors</b> kernel variable for this purpose.</p>

<p>Callers cannot assume that the <b>KeQueryActiveProcessorCount</b> routine maps processors to bits in the returned <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551830">KAFFINITY</a> value consecutively, or that the routine will return the same bitmask each time it is called.</p>

<p>Callers must also be aware that the value returned by <b>KeQueryActiveProcessorCount</b> can change at runtime on versions of Windows that support hot-add CPU functionality.</p>

<p>If necessary, register for notification of changes to the number of processors by calling the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553120">KeRegisterProcessorChangeCallback</a> routine.</p>

<p>To query just the affinity mask without getting the number of active processors, use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553001">KeQueryActiveProcessors</a>.</p>

<p>Windows 7 and later versions of Windows support processor groups. Drivers that are designed to handle information about processor groups should use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552993">KeQueryActiveProcessorCountEx</a> routine, which specifies a processor group, instead of <b>KeQueryActiveProcessorCount</b>, which does not. However, the implementation of <b>KeQueryActiveProcessorCount</b> in Windows 7 and later versions of Windows provides compatibility for drivers that were written for earlier versions of Windows, which do not support processor groups. In this implementation, <b>KeQueryActiveProcessorCount</b> returns the number of active logical processors in group 0, and writes an affinity mask to *<i>ActiveProcessors</i> that specifies the set of active logical processors in group 0. </p>

<p>The KAFFINITY type is an affinity mask that represents a set of logical processors in a group. The KAFFINITY type is 32 bits on a 32-bit version of Windows and is 64 bits on a 64-bit version of Windows.</p>

<p>If a group contains <i>n</i> logical processors, the processors are numbered from 0 to <i>n</i>-1. Processor number <i>i</i> in the group is represented by bit <i>i</i> in the affinity mask, where <i>i</i> is in the range 0 to <i>n</i>-1. Affinity mask bits that do not correspond to logical processors are always zero.</p>

<p>For example, if a KAFFINITY value identifies the active processors in a group, the mask bit for a processor is one if the processor is active, and is zero if the processor is not active.</p>

<p>The number of bits in the affinity mask determines the maximum number of logical processors in a group. For a 64-bit version of Windows, the maximum number of processors per group is 64. For a 32-bit version of Windows, the maximum number of processors per group is 32. Call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553044">KeQueryMaximumProcessorCountEx</a> routine to obtain the maximum number of processors per group. This number depends on the hardware configuration of the multiprocessor system, but can never exceed the fixed 64-processor and 32-processor limits that are set by the 64-bit and 32-bit versions of Windows, respectively.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546539">GROUP_AFFINITY</a> structure contains an affinity mask and a group number. The group number identifies the group to which the affinity mask applies.</p>

<p>Kernel routines that use the KAFFINITY type include <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548371">IoConnectInterrupt</a>, <b>KeQueryActiveProcessorCount</b>, and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553001">KeQueryActiveProcessors</a>. </p>
