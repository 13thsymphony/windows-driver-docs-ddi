## -description
The DXGK_CHILD_DEVICE_HPD_AWARENESS enumeration is used to describe the hot plug capabilities of a child device of a display adapter.



## -syntax

````
typedef enum _DXGK_CHILD_DEVICE_HPD_AWARENESS { 
  HpdAwarenessUninitialized    = 0,
  HpdAwarenessAlwaysConnected  = 1,
  HpdAwarenessNone             = 2,
  HpdAwarenessPolled           = 3,
  HpdAwarenessInterruptible    = 4
} DXGK_CHILD_DEVICE_HPD_AWARENESS, *PDXGK_CHILD_DEVICE_HPD_AWARENESS;
