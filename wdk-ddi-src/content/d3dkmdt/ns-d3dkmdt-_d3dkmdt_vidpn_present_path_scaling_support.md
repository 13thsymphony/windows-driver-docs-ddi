# _D3DKMDT_VIDPN_PRESENT_PATH_SCALING_SUPPORT structure



## -description
The D3DKMDT_VIDPN_PRESENT_PATH_SCALING_SUPPORT structure is used to indicate the types of scaling (and centering) that are supported by a particular VidPN present path.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _D3DKMDT_VIDPN_PRESENT_PATH_SCALING_SUPPORT {
  UINT Identity  :1;
  UINT Centered  :1;
  UINT Stretched  :1;
  UINT AspectRatioCenteredMax  :1;
  UINT Custom  :1;
} D3DKMDT_VIDPN_PRESENT_PATH_SCALING_SUPPORT;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Identity

The path is capable of displaying content with no transformation.


### -field Centered

The path is capable of displaying centered content.


### -field Stretched

The path is capable of displaying scaled content.


### -field AspectRatioCenteredMax

The path is capable of scaling source content to fit the target while preserving the aspect ratio of the source.

This member is available beginning with Windows 7.


### -field Custom

The path is capable of displaying one or more scaling modes that are not described by other members of this structure.


## -remarks
The <b>ScalingSupport</b> member of a <a href="..\d3dkmdt\ns-d3dkmdt-_d3dkmdt_vidpn_present_path_transformation.md">D3DKMDT_VIDPN_PRESENT_PATH_TRANSFORMATION</a> structure is a D3DKMDT_VIDPN_PRESENT_PATH_SCALING_SUPPORT structure.
