# _DXGK_DISPLAY_INFORMATION structure
Contains the display information that is passed between the operating system and the display miniport driver when the driver is started or stopped in response to a Plug and Play (PnP) event.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DXGK_DISPLAY_INFORMATION {
  UINT                           Width;
  UINT                           Height;
  UINT                           Pitch;
  D3DDDIFORMAT                   ColorFormat;
  PHYSICAL_ADDRESS               PhysicAddress;
  D3DDDI_VIDEO_PRESENT_TARGET_ID TargetId;
  ULONG                          AcpiId;
} DXGK_DISPLAY_INFORMATION, *PDXGK_DISPLAY_INFORMATION;
````

## Members


`AcpiId`

A ULONG value that specifies the ACPI identifier of the video present target specified by the <b>TargetId</b> member.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  If the video present target is not an ACPI device, this member must be set to zero.</div>
<div> </div>

`ColorFormat`

A value of type <a href="..\d3dukmdt\ne-d3dukmdt-_d3dddiformat.md">D3DDDIFORMAT</a> that indicates the pixel color format of the current display mode. The driver does not have to support all color formats in the <b>D3DDDIFORMAT</b> structure. For more information on formats that must be supported, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6454adb3-c958-467b-acbc-b8937b98cd57">DxgkCbAcquirePostDisplayOwnership</a> and <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_stop_device_and_release_post_display_ownership.md">DxgkDdiStopDeviceAndReleasePostDisplayOwnership</a>.

`Height`

A UINT value that specifies the height of the current display mode  in units of pixels.

`PhysicAddress`

The physical start address of the frame buffer for the current display mode.

`Pitch`

A UINT value that specifies the total number of bytes contained in one screen line.

`TargetId`

An integer value that specifies the identifier of the video present target on the display adapter that the display device is connected to.

`Width`

A UINT value that specifies the width of the current display mode in units of pixels.
