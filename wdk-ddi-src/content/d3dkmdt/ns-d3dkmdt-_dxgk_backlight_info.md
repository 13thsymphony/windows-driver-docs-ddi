# _DXGK_BACKLIGHT_INFO structure
Contains the current level of backlight reduction that is applied to the integrated display panel. Used by Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) 1.2 and later display miniport drivers that support adaptive brightness control.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DXGK_BACKLIGHT_INFO {
  USHORT                        BacklightUsersetting;
  USHORT                        BacklightEffective;
  D3DDDI_GAMMA_RAMP_RGB256x3x16 GammaRamp;
} DXGK_BACKLIGHT_INFO;
````

## Members


`BacklightEffective`

[out] The absolute brightness level in hardware that is currently set by the display miniport drive for adaptive brightness control.

This member can range in value from 0 to 65535.

`BacklightUsersetting`

[out] The absolute brightness level in hardware that corresponds to the current percent brightness level requested by the operating system.

This member can range in value from 0 to 65535.

`GammaRamp`

[out] A <a href="..\d3dukmdt\ns-d3dukmdt-_d3dddi_gamma_ramp_rgb256x3x16.md">D3DDDI_GAMMA_RAMP_RGB256x3x16</a> structure that contains a description of a gamma lookup table.
This lookup table represents the gamma ramp that has been optimized for backlight display by the display miniport driver from a gamma ramp set by an application.

## Remarks
For more information about the use of this structure, see Remarks of the <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgk_brightness_get_backlight_reduction.md">DxgkDdiGetBacklightReduction</a> function.
