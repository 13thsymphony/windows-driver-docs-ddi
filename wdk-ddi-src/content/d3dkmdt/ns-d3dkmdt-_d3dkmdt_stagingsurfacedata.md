# _D3DKMDT_STAGINGSURFACEDATA structure
The D3DKMDT_STAGINGSURFACEDATA structure describes the lockable staging surface that data is transferred into from an application's back buffer.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DKMDT_STAGINGSURFACEDATA {
  UINT Width;
  UINT Height;
  UINT Pitch;
} D3DKMDT_STAGINGSURFACEDATA;
````

## Members


`Height`

[in] The height of the staging buffer, in pixels.

`Pitch`

[out] The width of the staging buffer, in bytes. The driver must return the pitch value because the staging buffer is lockable.

`Width`

[in] The width of the staging buffer, in pixels.

## Remarks
The D3DKMDT_STAGINGSURFACEDATA structure is passed by the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem in a call to the display miniport driver's <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_getstandardallocationdriverdata.md">DxgkDdiGetStandardAllocationDriverData</a> function to generate a description of a lockable staging surface. The graphics subsystem calls the display miniport driver's <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_present.md">DxgkDdiPresent</a> function to issue bit-block transfer (bitblt) requests to transfer data from an application's back buffer into the staging surface. The staging surface is then locked and read by the CPU. 

A staging surface is potentially created for the present operation when a direct bit-block transfer to the primary surface is not possible (for example, in multiple-monitor or sprites cases). 

This staging surface is always created as an 8-bits-per-color RGB pixel format (which is specified by the D3DDDIFMT_X8R8G8B8 value from the <a href="..\d3dukmdt\ne-d3dukmdt-_d3dddiformat.md">D3DDDIFORMAT</a> enumeration). Because the dimensions of the staging surface always match the dimensions of the back buffer, no stretch or shrink operation is required for the present operation to the staging surface.
