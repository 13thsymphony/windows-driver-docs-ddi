## -remarks
The <b>Rotation</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dkmdt\ns-d3dkmdt-_d3dkmdt_vidpn_present_path_transformation.md">D3DKMDT_VIDPN_PRESENT_PATH_TRANSFORMATION</a> structure is a value from the <b>D3DKMDT_VIDPN_PRESENT_PATH_ROTATION</b> enumeration.

Starting with Windows 8.1 Update, new constant values (<b>D3DKMDT_VPPR_XXX_OFFSETXXX</b>) are available to specify both the default orientation of a display device and an additional angle (offset) that the user has rotated the device.

Here are some examples of how to set the default orientation and offset:
