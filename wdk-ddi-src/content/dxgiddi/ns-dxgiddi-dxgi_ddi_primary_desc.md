# DXGI_DDI_PRIMARY_DESC structure
Describes a resource that is used as a primary (that is, a resource that is scanned out to the display).

## Syntax
````
typedef struct DXGI_DDI_PRIMARY_DESC {
  UINT                           Flags;
  D3DDDI_VIDEO_PRESENT_SOURCE_ID VidPnSourceId;
  DXGI_DDI_MODE_DESC             ModeDesc;
  UINT                           DriverFlags;
} DXGI_DDI_PRIMARY_DESC;
````

## Members


`DriverFlags`

[out] A valid bitwise OR of values that indicate how the driver can display the resource. 

The DXGI_DDI_PRIMARY_DRIVER_FLAG_NO_SCANOUT (0x1) value is currently the only supported value. This bit indicates that the driver cannot support the runtime setting any subresource of the specified resource as a primary. The user-mode display driver should set this bit if it implements presentation from this surface through a copy operation. Therefore, the runtime will not use flip-style presentation if this bit is set.

`Flags`

[in] A valid bitwise OR of any of the following values that indicates how the resource is displayed. 
<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DXGI_DDI_PRIMARY_OPTIONAL (0x1)

</td>
<td>
The user-mode display driver can prevent the resource from ever being a primary. 

The driver can prevent the actual flip (from optional primary to regular primary) and can use a copy-style present operation. Therefore, in this way, the driver might be able to prevent the resource from being actually used as a primary.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DXGI_DDI_PRIMARY_NONPREROTATED (0x2)

</td>
<td>
The primary really represents the DXGI_DDI_MODE_ROTATION_IDENTITY-type rotation, even though it is used with non-DXGI_DDI_MODE_ROTATION_IDENTITY-type display modes, because applications will handle the output orientation by rotating, for example, the viewport and projection matrix.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DXGI_DDI_PRIMARY_STEREO (0x4)

</td>
<td>
Supported in   Windows 8 and later versions.

The primary represents a stereo back buffer.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`ModeDesc`

[in] A <a href="..\dxgiddi\ns-dxgiddi-dxgi_ddi_mode_desc.md">DXGI_DDI_MODE_DESC</a> structure that describes the display mode.

`VidPnSourceId`

[in] The zero-based identification number of the video present source in a path of a video present network (VidPN) topology that the primary surface is created on.
