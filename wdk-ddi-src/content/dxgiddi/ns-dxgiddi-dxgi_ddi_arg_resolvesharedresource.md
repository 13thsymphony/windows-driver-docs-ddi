# DXGI_DDI_ARG_RESOLVESHAREDRESOURCE structure
The DXGI_DDI_ARG_RESOLVESHAREDRESOURCE structure describes the parameters that the user-mode display driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569488">ResolveSharedResourceDXGI</a> function uses to synchronize a shared surface or a GDI interoperable surface.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct DXGI_DDI_ARG_RESOLVESHAREDRESOURCE {
  DXGI_DDI_HDEVICE   hDevice;
  DXGI_DDI_HRESOURCE hResource;
} DXGI_DDI_ARG_RESOLVESHAREDRESOURCE;
````

## Members


`hDevice`

[in] A handle to the display device (graphics context) that is associated with the shared surface or GDI interoperable surface. The Direct3D runtime passes this handle to the driver in the <b>hDrvDevice</b> member of the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\ns-d3d10umddi-d3d10ddiarg_createdevice.md">D3D10DDIARG_CREATEDEVICE</a> structure when the runtime calls the driver's <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_createdevice.md">CreateDevice(D3D10)</a> function to create the display device.

`hResource`

[in] A handle to the surface that the driver uses as a shared surface or in GDI interoperability.
