# DXGIDDICB_PRESENT structure
The DXGIDDICB_PRESENT structure describes allocations that content is copied to and from.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct DXGIDDICB_PRESENT {
  D3DKMT_HANDLE hSrcAllocation;
  D3DKMT_HANDLE hDstAllocation;
  void          *pDXGIContext;
  HANDLE        hContext;
  UINT          BroadcastContextCount;
  HANDLE        BroadcastContext[D3DDDI_MAX_BROADCAST_CONTEXT];
} DXGIDDICB_PRESENT;
````

## Members

        
            `BroadcastContext`

            [in] An array of handles to the additional contexts to broadcast the current present operation to. The <b>D3DDDI_MAX_BROADCAST_CONTEXT</b> constant, which is defined as 64, defines the maximum number of additional contexts that the user-mode display driver can broadcast the current present operation to. 

Broadcasting is supported only for flip operations. To broadcast a flip operation, the display miniport driver must support memory mapped I/O (MMIO)-based flips. To indicate support of MMIO flips, the display miniport driver sets the <b>FlipOnVSyncMmIo</b> bit-field flag in the <b>FlipCaps</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_drivercaps.md">DXGK_DRIVERCAPS</a> structure when its <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_queryadapterinfo.md">DxgkDdiQueryAdapterInfo</a> function is called.

The original context that the <b>hContext</b> member specifies and that the user-mode display driver presents to is not an element in the <b>BroadcastContext</b> array. For example, if the <b>BroadcastContext</b> array contains one element, the user-mode display driver sends the present operation to the owning context (<b>hContext</b>) and broadcasts to that one additional context.
        
            `BroadcastContextCount`

            [in] The number of additional contexts in the array that the <b>BroadcastContext</b> member specifies.
        
            `hContext`

            [in] A handle to the context that the driver submits the copy operation to. The user-mode display driver previously created this context by calling the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f3f5d6bc-3bc6-4214-830a-cffff01069cc">pfnCreateContextCb</a> function.
        
            `hDstAllocation`

            [in] A D3DKMT_HANDLE data type that represents a kernel-mode handle to the destination allocation. <b>hDstAllocation</b> can be zero if the destination is unknown; kernel mode will determine the destination just before sending the hardware command stream through DMA to the graphics processor.
        
            `hSrcAllocation`

            [in] A D3DKMT_HANDLE data type that represents a kernel-mode handle to the source allocation. The Microsoft Direct3D runtime's <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_allocatecb.md">pfnAllocateCb</a> function returns this handle. Therefore, the user-mode display driver should use this handle to copy content from.
        
            `pDXGIContext`

            [in] A handle to the Microsoft DirectX Graphics Infrastructure (DXGI) context. This handle is opaque to the driver. The driver should assign the handle from the <b>pDXGIContext</b> member of the <a href="..\dxgiddi\ns-dxgiddi-dxgi_ddi_arg_present.md">DXGI_DDI_ARG_PRESENT</a> structure that the driver received in a call to its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569179">PresentDXGI</a> function to this member.
