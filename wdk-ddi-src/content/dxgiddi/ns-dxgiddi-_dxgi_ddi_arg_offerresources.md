# _DXGI_DDI_ARG_OFFERRESOURCES structure
Describes video memory resources that the user-mode display driver offers for reuse. Used with the <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_offerresources.md">pfnOfferResources</a> function. Used with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/AF3DCD16-9F8C-442A-A9A5-9EA2BD1C3B84">pfnReclaimResources</a> function by Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) 1.2 and later user-mode display drivers.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DXGI_DDI_ARG_OFFERRESOURCES {
  DXGI_DDI_HDEVICE         hDevice;
  const DXGI_DDI_HRESOURCE *pResources;
  UINT                     Resources;
  D3DDDI_OFFER_PRIORITY    Priority;
} DXGI_DDI_ARG_OFFERRESOURCES;
````

## Members


`hDevice`

[in] A handle to the display device (graphics context) on which the driver offers resources for reuse.

The Direct3D runtime passed this handle to the driver in the <b>hDrvDevice</b> member of the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\ns-d3d10umddi-d3d10ddiarg_createdevice.md">D3D10DDIARG_CREATEDEVICE</a> structure when it created the device by calling the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_createdevice.md">CreateDevice(D3D10)</a> routine.

`pResources`

[in] A pointer to an array of handles to the video memory resources that the driver offers.

`Priority`

[in] A value of type <a href="..\d3dukmdt\ne-d3dukmdt-_d3dddi_offer_priority.md">D3DDDI_OFFER_PRIORITY</a> that indicates the importance of the resources pointed to by <b>pResources</b>.

`Resources`

[in] The number of elements in the array pointed to by <b>pResources</b>.
