# _CDROM_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK_STATE structure



## -description
The CDROM_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK_STATE structure is used by the CD-ROM class driver to report the exclusive access state of a CD-ROM device.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _CDROM_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK_STATE {
  BOOLEAN LockState;
  UCHAR   CallerName[CDROM_EXCLUSIVE_CALLER_LENGTH];
} CDROM_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK_STATE, *PCDROM_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK_STATE;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field LockState

A Boolean value that indicates whether the CD-ROM device is locked for exclusive access. If <b>TRUE</b>, the device is locked. If <b>FALSE</b>, the device is not locked.


### -field CallerName

A <b>NULL</b>-terminated string that identifies the application or system component that has a lock on the CD-ROM device. The length of the string must be less than or equal to CDROM_EXCLUSIVE_CALLER_LENGTH bytes, including the <b>NULL</b> character at the end of the string. The string must contain alphanumerics (A - Z, a - z, 0 - 9), spaces, periods, commas, colons (:), semi-colons (;), hyphens (-), and underscores (_).


## -remarks
The CD-ROM class driver reports the exclusive access state of a CD-ROM device in response to the <a href="..\ntddcdrm\ni-ntddcdrm-ioctl_cdrom_exclusive_access.md">IOCTL_CDROM_EXCLUSIVE_ACCESS</a> request.
