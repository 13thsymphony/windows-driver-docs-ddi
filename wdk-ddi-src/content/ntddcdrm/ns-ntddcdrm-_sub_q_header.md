# _SUB_Q_HEADER structure
The SUB_Q_HEADER structure contains audio status information and the length of the Q subchannel data being returned. This structure is used in conjunction with <a href="..\ntddcdrm\ns-ntddcdrm-_sub_q_channel_data.md">SUB_Q_CHANNEL_DATA</a>.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _SUB_Q_HEADER {
  UCHAR Reserved;
  UCHAR AudioStatus;
  UCHAR DataLength[2];
} SUB_Q_HEADER, *PSUB_Q_HEADER;
````

## Members


`AudioStatus`

Reports the audio status with one of the following flags:














#### AUDIO_STATUS_IN_PROGRESS

Audio play operation is in progress.


#### AUDIO_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED

Audio status byte not supported or not valid.


#### AUDIO_STATUS_NO_STATUS

No current audio status to return.


#### AUDIO_STATUS_PAUSED

Audio play operation is paused.


#### AUDIO_STATUS_PLAY_COMPLETE

Audio play operation completed successfully.


#### AUDIO_STATUS_PLAY_ERROR

Audio play operation stopped due to error.

`DataLength`

Gives the length of Q subchannel data that follows this header structure. The bytes in this array are arranged in big-endian order. <b>DataLength</b>[0] contains the most significant byte, and <b>DataLength</b>[1] contains the least significant byte.

`Reserved`
