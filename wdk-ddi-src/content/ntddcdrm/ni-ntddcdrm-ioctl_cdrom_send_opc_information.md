description: The IOCTL_CDROM_SEND_OPC_INFORMATION control code can be used in file systems and other implementations that want to perform the Optimum Power Calibration (OPC) procedure in advance, so that the first streaming write does not have to wait for the procedure to finish. The optical drive performs the OPC procedure to determine the optimum power of the laser during write. The procedure is necessary to ensure quality, but it wears out the media and should not be performed too often.

# IOCTL_CDROM_SEND_OPC_INFORMATION IOCTL
The <b>IOCTL_CDROM_SEND_OPC_INFORMATION</b> 
   control code can be used in  file systems and other implementations that want to perform the Optimum Power Calibration (OPC) procedure in advance, so that the first streaming write does not have to wait for the procedure to finish. The optical drive performs the OPC procedure to determine the optimum power of the laser during write. The procedure is necessary to ensure quality, but it wears out the media and should not be performed too often.

To perform this operation, call the 
   <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/1d35c087-6672-4fc6-baa1-a886dd9d3878">DeviceIoControl</a> 
   function with   <b>IOCTL_CDROM_SEND_OPC_INFORMATION</b> as the <i>dwIoControlCode</i> parameter.

### Major Code
[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](xref:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control")

### Input Buffer
<a href="..\ntddcdrm\ns-ntddcdrm-_cdrom_simple_opc_info.md">CDROM_SIMPLE_OPC_INFO</a>

### Input Buffer Length
Length of a <a href="..\ntddcdrm\ns-ntddcdrm-_cdrom_simple_opc_info.md">CDROM_SIMPLE_OPC_INFO</a>.

### Output Buffer
None.

### Output Buffer Length
None.

### Input / Output Buffer
<text></text>

### Input / Output Buffer Length
<text></text>

### Status Block
The <b>Information</b> field is set to the number of bytes returned. 

Because of  status code propagation from other APIs, the <b>Status</b> field can be set to (but is not limited to) the following:

## Remarks
The <b>IOCTL_CDROM_SEND_OPC_INFORMATION</b> IOCTL is a wrapper over the SEND OPC INFORMATION command of the MMC specification. The <b>Exclude0</b> and <b>Exclude1</b> fields directly map to the SEND OPC INFORMATION fields with the same names.

On failures, this IOCTL returns standard errors, such as STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_READY, STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT, STATUS_IO_DEVICE_ERROR.

## Requirements
