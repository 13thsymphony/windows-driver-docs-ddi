# DRIVER_INITIALIZE callback function
<b>DriverEntry</b> is the first routine called after a driver is loaded, and is responsible for initializing the driver.

## Syntax

```
DRIVER_INITIALIZE DriverInitialize;

NTSTATUS DriverInitialize(
  _DRIVER_OBJECT *DriverObject,
  PUNICODE_STRING RegistryPath
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`*DriverObject`

A pointer to a <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_driver_object.md">DRIVER_OBJECT</a> structure. This is the driver's driver object.

`RegistryPath`

A pointer to a counted Unicode string specifying the path to the driver's registry key.


## Return Value

If the routine succeeds, it must return STATUS_SUCCESS. Otherwise, it must return one of the error status values defined in Ntstatus.h.

## Remarks

The <i>DriverObject</i> parameter supplies the <b>DriverEntry</b> routine with a pointer to the driver's driver object, which is allocated by the I/O manager. The <b>DriverEntry</b> routine must fill in the driver object with entry points for the driver's standard routines.

The <i>DriverObject</i> pointer gives the driver access to <i>DriverObject-</i>&gt;<b>HardwareDatabase</b>, which points to a counted Unicode string that specifies a path to the registry's <b>\Registry\Machine\Hardware</b> tree.

The registry path string pointed to by <i>RegistryPath</i> is of the form <b>\Registry\Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\<i>DriverName</i></b>. A driver can use this path to store driver-specific information; see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/overview-of-registry-trees-and-keys">Registry Keys for Drivers</a>. The <b>DriverEntry</b> routine should save a copy of the Unicode string, not the pointer, since the I/O manager frees the <i>RegistryPath</i> buffer after <b>DriverEntry</b> returns.

For more information about implementing a <b>DriverEntry</b> routine, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566402">Writing a DriverEntry Routine</a>.

While it is possible to name this routine something other than <b>DriverEntry</b>, doing so is not recommended. The DDK-supplied build tools automatically inform the linker that the driver's entry point is called <b>DriverEntry</b>, so giving the routine another name requires you to modify the build tools. For more information about build tools, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows-drivers/develop/building_a_driver">Building a Driver</a>.


#### Examples

To define a <b>DriverEntry</b> callback routine, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of callback routine you're defining. Windows provides a set of callback function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the callback function types helps <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2F3549EF-B50F-455A-BDC7-1F67782B8DCA">Code Analysis for Drivers</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/74feeb16-387c-4796-987a-aff3fb79b556">Static Driver Verifier</a> (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it's a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

To define a <b>DriverEntry</b> callback routine, use the DRIVER_INITIALIZE type as shown in this code example:

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>DRIVER_INITIALIZE DriverEntry;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
Then, implement your callback routine as follows:

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
_Use_decl_annotations_
NTSTATUS 
  DriverEntry( 
    struct _DRIVER_OBJECT  *DriverObject,
    PUNICODE_STRING  RegistryPath 
    )
  {
      // Function body
  }</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
The DRIVER_INITIALIZE function type is defined in the Wdm.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation to your function definition. The _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the DRIVER_INITIALIZE function type in the header file are used. For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3260b53e-82be-4dbc-8ac5-d0e52de77f9d">Declaring Functions by Using Function Role Types for WDM Drivers</a>. For information about _Use_decl_annotations_, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=286697">Annotating Function Behavior</a>.
