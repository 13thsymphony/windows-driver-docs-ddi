# _PTP_VENDOR_DATA_OUT structure
The PTP_VENDOR_DATA_OUT structure contains information that the device sends to an application, in response to a command the application issued to the device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PTP_VENDOR_DATA_OUT {
  WORD  ResponseCode;
  DWORD SessionId;
  DWORD TransactionId;
  DWORD Params[PTP_MAX_PARAMS];
  BYTE  VendorReadData[1];
} PTP_VENDOR_DATA_OUT, *PPTP_VENDOR_DATA_OUT;
````

## Members


`Params`

Is an array consisting of PTP_MAX_PARAMS (defined in <i>Ptpusd.h</i>) elements, representing the parameters of the response.
