# Serports


Overview of the Serports technology.

To develop Serports, you need these headers:

 * [ntddser.h](..\ntddser\index.md)
 * [sercx.h](..\sercx\index.md)



This reference section describes the Windows serial I/O request interface that is used by drivers and applications to send I/O requests to serial ports. Also described is the device driver interface (DDI) that an extension-based serial controller driver uses to communicate with version 1 or 2 of the serial framework extension (SerCx or SerCx2). The serial I/O request interface is supported by SerCx and SerCx2, and by the inbox serial driver, Serial.sys. Serial.sys is augmented by the Serenum service and the COM port database.

For more information, see Serial Controller Drivers Overview.
