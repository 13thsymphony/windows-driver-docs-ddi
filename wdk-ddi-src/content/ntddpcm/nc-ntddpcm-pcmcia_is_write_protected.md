# PCMCIA_IS_WRITE_PROTECTED callback function
The <b>PCMCIA_IS_WRITE_PROTECTED</b> interface routine returns the write-protect condition of a PCMCIA memory card.

## Syntax

```
PCMCIA_IS_WRITE_PROTECTED PcmciaIsWriteProtected;

BOOLEAN PcmciaIsWriteProtected(
  PVOID Context
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Context`

Pointer to the context for the interface routine.


## Return Value

The <b>PCMCIA_IS_WRITE_PROTECTED </b>interface routine returns <b>TRUE</b> if the memory card is write-protected, otherwise it returns <b>FALSE</b>.

## Remarks

A caller must set the <i>Context</i> parameter to the context that is specified by the PCMCIA bus driver. The PCMCIA bus driver returns the context for the interface routines in the <b>Context</b> member of the same PCMCIA_INTERFACE_STANDARD structure that contains the pointers to the interface routines. If the <i>Context</i> parameter is not valid, system behavior is not defined, and the system might halt.

Callers of this routine must be running at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL. To maintain overall system performance, it is recommended that drivers call this routine at IRQL &lt; DISPATCH_LEVEL.

## Requirements
