# IOCTL_SOCKET_INFORMATION IOCTL



## -description
This request retrieves socket information for the socket that is indicated by the caller. 



## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> in the I/O stack location of the IRP indicates the size, in bytes, of the input buffer, which must be greater than or equal to <b>sizeof</b>(PCMCIA_SOCKET_INFORMATION).

The caller initializes the <b>Socket</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537612">PCMCIA_SOCKET_INFORMATION</a> structure at the beginning of the buffer at <b>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b>. 


### -input-buffer-length
<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> in the I/O stack location of the IRP indicates the size, in bytes, of the input buffer, which must be greater than or equal to <b>sizeof</b>(PCMCIA_SOCKET_INFORMATION).


### -output-buffer
The PCMCIA bus driver stores the requested socket data in a structure of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537612">PCMCIA_SOCKET_INFORMATION</a> at the beginning of the buffer at <b>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b>. 


### -output-buffer-length
The size of the requested socket data.


### -in-out-buffer

<text></text>

### -inout-buffer-length

<text></text>

### -status-block
I/O Status block
The <b>Information</b> field is set to the number of bytes read. 

If the operation is successful, the <b>Status</b> field is set to STATUS_SUCCESS.

If <b>InputBufferLength</b> is less than <b>sizeof</b>(PCMCIA_SOCKET_INFORMATION), the <b>Status</b> field is set to STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL.

If <b>OutputBufferLength</b> is less than <b>sizeof</b>(PCMCIA_SOCKET_INFORMATION), the <b>Status</b> field is set to STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL.

If the bus driver cannot identify a socket that is associated with the socket number indicated in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537612">PCMCIA_SOCKET_INFORMATION</a>, the <b>Status</b> field is set to STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.

If there is no card in the indicated socket, the <b>Status</b> field is set to STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL.
