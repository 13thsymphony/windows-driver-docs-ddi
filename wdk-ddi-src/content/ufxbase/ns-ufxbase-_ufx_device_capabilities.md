# _UFX_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES structure
The <b>UFX_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES</b> structure is used USB to define properties of the Universal Serial Bus (USB) device created by the controller.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct _UFX_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES {
  ULONG            Size;
  USB_DEVICE_SPEED MaxSpeed;
  ULONG            RemoteWakeSignalDelay;
  BOOLEAN          PdcpSupported;
  USHORT           InEndpointBitmap;
  USHORT           OutEndpointBitmap;
} UFX_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES, *PUFX_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES;
```

## Members


`Size`

Size of the <b>UFX_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES</b> structure.

`MaxSpeed`

Indicates the maximum USB speed supported by the device.

`RemoteWakeSignalDelay`

The minimum time interval in milliseconds to wait after being suspended before requesting remote wakeup.

`PdcpSupported`

If  <b>true</b>, indicates the client driver supports proprietary charger detection.

`InEndpointBitmap`

A bitmap that defines which endpoint numbers can support an IN endpoint.  Bit 0 indicates endpoint address 0, bit 1 indicates endpoint address 1, etc.   Bit 0 (the default control endpoint) is required to be set to 1.

`OutEndpointBitmap`

A bitmap that defines which endpoint numbers can support an OUT endpoint.  Bit 0 indicates endpoint address 0, bit 1 indicates endpoint address 1, etc.   Bit 0 (the default control endpoint) is required to be set to 1.
