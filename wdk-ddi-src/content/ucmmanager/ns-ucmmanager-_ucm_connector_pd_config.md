# _UCM_CONNECTOR_PD_CONFIG structure
Describes the Power Delivery 2.0 capabilities of the connector.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _UCM_CONNECTOR_PD_CONFIG {
  ULONG                            Size;
  BOOLEAN                          IsSupported;
  ULONG                            SupportedPowerRoles;
  PFN_UCM_CONNECTOR_SET_POWER_ROLE EvtSetPowerRole;
} UCM_CONNECTOR_PD_CONFIG, *PUCM_CONNECTOR_PD_CONFIG;
````

## Members


`EvtSetPowerRole`

A pointer to the Policy Manager's implementation of the <a href="..\ucmmanager\nc-ucmmanager-evt_ucm_connector_set_power_role.md">EVT_UCM_CONNECTOR_SET_POWER_ROLE</a> event callback.

`IsSupported`

If TRUE, a PD role is supported. (Default).

If FALSE, a PD role is not supported.

`Size`

Size of the <b>UCM_CONNECTOR_PD_CONFIG</b> structure.

`SupportedPowerRoles`

Indicates the operating mode of the connector. This value is a bitwise OR of <a href="..\ucmtypes\ne-ucmtypes-_ucm_power_role.md">UCM_POWER_ROLE</a>-typed flags.

## Remarks
Initialize this structure by calling <a href="..\ucmmanager\nf-ucmmanager-ucm_connector_pd_config_init.md">UCM_CONNECTOR_PD_CONFIG_INIT</a>. An initialized <a href="..\ucmmanager\ns-ucmmanager-_ucm_connector_typec_config.md">UCM_CONNECTOR_TYPEC_CONFIG</a> structure is set to the <b>PdConfig</b> member of the <a href="..\ucmmanager\ns-ucmmanager-_ucm_connector_config.md">UCM_CONNECTOR_CONFIG</a> structure, which is an input parameter value to <a href="..\ucmmanager\nf-ucmmanager-ucmconnectorcreate.md">UcmConnectorCreate</a> that is called by Policy Manager to create a connector object.
