# UcmConnectorTypeCCurrentAdChanged function
Notifies the USB connector manager framework extension (UcmCx) when the specified connector changes the current advertisement. Either the connector changes it (when it is DFP/Source), or the partner changed it (when it is UFP/Sink).

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS UcmConnectorTypeCCurrentAdChanged(
  [in] UCMCONNECTOR      Connector,
  [in] UCM_TYPEC_CURRENT CurrentAdvertisement
);
````

## Parameters

`Connector`

Handle to the connector object that the client driver received in the previous call to <a href="..\ucmmanager\nf-ucmmanager-ucmconnectorcreate.md">UcmConnectorCreate</a>.

`CurrentAdvertisement`

The new current advertisement of the connector indicated by one of the <a href="..\ucmtypes\ne-ucmtypes-_ucm_typec_current.md">UCM_TYPEC_CURRENT</a>-typed flags.


## Return Value

<b>UcmConnectorTypeCCurrentAdChanged</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this method can return an appropriate <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7792201b-63bb-4db5-803d-2af02893d505">NTSTATUS</a> value.

## Remarks

When using a Type-C connector for charging, the partner connector sends a current advertisement when it's attached to the local connector. That initial advertisement is report to UcmCx  by calling <a href="..\ucmmanager\nf-ucmmanager-ucmconnectortypecattach.md">UcmConnectorTypeCAttach</a>.  During the lifetime of the connection, the current level advertised by the source might change. The client driver must notify UcmCx about  that change by calling method.
