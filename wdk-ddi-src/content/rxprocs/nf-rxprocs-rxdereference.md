# RxDereference function
<b>RxDereference</b> decrements the <b>NodeReferenceCount</b> member of a structure by one for several reference counted data structures used by RDBSS.

## Syntax

````
VOID RxDereference(
  _Inout_ PVOID              Instance,
  _In_    LOCK_HOLDING_STATE LockHoldingState
);
````

## Parameters

`Instance`

A pointer to the reference-counted data structure to be dereferenced.

`LockHoldingState`

The mode in which the appropriate lock for this data structure is held. This parameter can be one of the following values for the LOCK_HOLDING_STATE enumeration:





#### LHS_LockNotHeld

A lock is not currently held.



#### LHS_SharedLockHeld

A shared lock is being held.



#### LHS_ExclusiveLockHeld

An exclusive lock is being held.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

<b>RxDereference</b> can be used to dereference (decrement by one) the <b>NodeReferenceCount</b> member on the following data structures used by RDBSS:

SRV_CALL

NET_ROOT

V_NET_ROOT

SRV_OPEN

FOBX

If <b>RxDereference</b> is called with any other type of RDBSS data structure, the routine causes the system to ASSERT on checked builds.

If the <b>NodeReferenceCount</b> member is less than 0 after being derefenced (decremented) by <b>RxDereference</b>, then <b>RxDereference</b> causes the system to ASSERT on checked builds. 

If the <b>NodeReferenceCount</b> member decrements to 1 and the <i>LockHoldingState</i> parameter was LHS_ExclusiveLockHeld, the instance of the data structure can be finalized immediately. Otherwise, the instance of the data structure is tagged to be scavenged and finalized later.
