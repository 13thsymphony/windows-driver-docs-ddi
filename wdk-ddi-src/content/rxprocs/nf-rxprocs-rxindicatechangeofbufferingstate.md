# RxIndicateChangeOfBufferingState function
<b>RxIndicateChangeOfBufferingState</b> is called to register a change buffering state request (an oplock break indication, for example) for later processing. If necessary, worker thread routines for further processing are activated.

## Syntax

```
void RxIndicateChangeOfBufferingState(
  PMRX_SRV_CALL SrvCall,
  PVOID         SrvOpenKey,
  PVOID         Context
);
```

## Parameters

`SrvCall`

A pointer to the SRV_CALL structure.

`SrvOpenKey`

A pointer to the key for the SRV_OPEN structure.

`Context`

TBD


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

<b>RxIndicateChangeOfBufferingState</b> registers the change buffering state request by either inserting it in the registration list (DPC Level processing ) or the appropriate dispatcher/handler list.

This is an instance in which the buffering state change request from the server identifies the SRV_OPEN structure using the key generated by the server. This implies that the key needs to be mapped onto the SRV_OPEN structure locally.

The internal routines called by this routine can fail because of a lack of available memory (unable to allocate non-paged pool memory, for example), but since this is a VOID routine no error is returned when this condition occurs.

If a buffering state request can be processed immediately instead of being queued for processing later, then <b>RxChangeBufferingState</b> can be called.
