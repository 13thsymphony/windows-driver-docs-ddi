# RxSetSrvCallDomainName function
<b>RxSetSrvCallDomainName</b> is called by a network mini-redirector driver to set the domain name associated with any given server (SRV_CALL structure).

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS RxSetSrvCallDomainName(
  _In_ PMRX_SRV_CALL   SrvCall,
  _In_ PUNICODE_STRING DomainName
);
````

## Parameters

`SrvCall`

A pointer to the SRV_CALL structure.

`DomainName`

A pointer to a buffer containing a zero-terminated Unicode string that names the domain to which this server belongs.


## Return Value

<b>RxSetSrvCallDomainName</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS on success or one of the following error values on failure: 

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
There were insufficient resources to complete this routine. The memory allocation request failed for nonpaged pool memory to store the new domain name.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

The domain name may not be known at the beginning of a network redirector request. The <b>RxSetSrvCallDomainName</b> routine allows the domain name to be associated with <i>SrvCall</i> once it is known. This routine would normally be used as part of the creation and initialization of a SRV_CALL structure.

If a domain name is already associated with the <i>SrvCall</i> parameter, then this domain name will be removed and the memory associated with this entry in <i>SrvCall</i> will be freed.

If the <i>DomainName</i> parameter is not a <b>NULL</b> pointer, and the <i>DomainName</i> parameter has a length greater than zero, then <b>RxSetSrvCallDomainName</b> allocates space for the <b>pDomainName</b> member of <i>SrvCall</i> from nonpaged pool with a pool tag of RX_SRVCALL_PARAMS_POOLTAG. The <b>RxSetSrvCallDomainName</b> routine sets the <b>buffer</b>, <b>length</b>, and <b>MaximumLength</b> members of the <b>pDomainName</b> structure.
