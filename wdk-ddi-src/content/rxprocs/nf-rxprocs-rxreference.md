# RxReference function
<b>RxReference</b> increments the <b>NodeReferenceCount</b> member of a structure by one for several of the reference counted data structures used by RDBSS.

## Syntax

````
VOID RxReference(
  _Inout_ PVOID Instance
);
````

## Parameters

`Instance`

A pointer to the reference-counted data structure to be referenced (incremented).


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

The <b>RxReference</b> routine can be used to reference (increment by one) the <b>NodeReferenceCount</b> member on the following data structures used by RDBSS:

SRV_CALL

NET_ROOT

V_NET_ROOT

SRV_OPEN

FOBX

If <b>RxReference</b> is called with any other type of RDBSS data structure, the routine causes the system to ASSERT on checked builds.
