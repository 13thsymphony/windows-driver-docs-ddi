## -struct-fields

### -field Size


                     Total size of the structure.
                 

### -field ShapeId


                     Unique id for the current cursor image. This is incremented each time a cursor image is set, even if that image has been set before. The id is used to check if the current cursor image the driver has cached has changed and cannot be used in any way to allow caching for animated cursor sequences.
                 

### -field CursorType


                     Indicates the type of cursor data written to the cursor shape buffer.
                 

### -field Width


                     Width in pixels of the cursor shape written to the shape buffer.
                 

### -field Height


                     Height in pixels of the cursor shape written to the shape buffer.
                 

### -field Pitch


                     Pitch in bytes of the cursor shape written to the shape buffer.
                 

### -field XHot


                     X position of the cursor hotspot relative to the top-left of the cursor.
                 

### -field YHot


                     Y position of the cursor hotspot relative to the top-left of the cursor.
