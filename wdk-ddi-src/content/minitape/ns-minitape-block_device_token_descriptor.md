# BLOCK_DEVICE_TOKEN_DESCRIPTOR structure
<b>BLOCK_DEVICE_TOKEN_DESCRIPTOR</b> contains the token returned from a the POPULATE TOKEN command for an offload read data operation. The token information is included as part of the <a href="..\storport\ns-storport-receive_token_information_response_header.md">RECEIVE_TOKEN_INFORMATION_RESPONSE_HEADER</a> structure.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _BLOCK_DEVICE_TOKEN_DESCRIPTOR {
  UCHAR TokenIdentifier[2];
  UCHAR Token[BLOCK_DEVICE_TOKEN_SIZE];
} BLOCK_DEVICE_TOKEN_DESCRIPTOR, *PBLOCK_DEVICE_TOKEN_DESCRIPTOR;
````

## Members


`Token`

A data value defining a token as a point-in-time representation of data (ROD) for an offload read data operation. <b>Token</b> is an opaque value and must be used unmodified in offload write data operations.

`TokenIdentifier`

An identifier value assigned by the copy provider to provide uniqueness to <b>Token</b> while the value of <b>Token</b> is valid. This member is reserved for system use and must not be modified.


## Requirements
