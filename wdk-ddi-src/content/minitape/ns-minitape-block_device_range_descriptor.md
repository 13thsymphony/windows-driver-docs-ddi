# BLOCK_DEVICE_RANGE_DESCRIPTOR structure
The <b>BLOCK_DEVICE_RANGE_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure describes a range of logical blocks associated with various fragments of a file for an offload copy operation.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _BLOCK_DEVICE_RANGE_DESCRIPTOR {
  UCHAR LogicalBlockAddress[8];
  UCHAR TransferLength[4];
  UCHAR Reserved[4];
} BLOCK_DEVICE_RANGE_DESCRIPTOR, *PBLOCK_DEVICE_RANGE_DESCRIPTOR;
````

## Members


`LogicalBlockAddress`

The starting logical block address of a block range.

`Reserved`

Reserved bytes.

`TransferLength`

The length, in logical blocks, of the block range.

## Remarks
If <i>TransferLength</i> is set to 0, the range descriptor is considered valid and does not cause an error when included in a token parameter list. No operation will be performed for this descriptor.

All multibyte values are in big endian format. Prior to setting, these values must be converted from the endian format of the current platform.

## Requirements
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows version** | Available starting with Windows 8. Available starting with Windows 8. |
| **Header** | minitape.h (include Scsi.h, Minitape.h, Storport.h) |
