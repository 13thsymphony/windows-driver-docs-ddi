# TAPE_ERROR_ROUTINE callback



## -description
<i>TAPE_ERROR_ROUTINE</i> provides device-specific error handling when an SRB is completed with an error status. This routine is optional.



## -prototype

````
TAPE_ERROR_ROUTINE (*TAPE_ERROR_ROUTINE);

VOID (*TAPE_ERROR_ROUTINE)(
  _In_    PVOID               MinitapeExtension,
  _In_    PSCSI_REQUEST_BLOCK Srb,
  _Inout_ PTAPE_STATUS        TapeStatus
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param MinitapeExtension [in]

Pointer to the driver-specific minitape extension. This is <b>NULL</b> if the miniclass driver did not request a minitape extension when it initialized.


### -param Srb [in]

Pointer to the SRB for the operation that failed.


### -param TapeStatus [in, out]

Pointer to the <a href="..\minitape\ne-minitape-_tape_status.md">TAPE_STATUS</a> set by the tape class driver. The tape miniclass driver can change the TAPE_STATUS or leave it unchanged.


## -returns
  None.


## -remarks
Most tape miniclass drivers do not provide a <i>TAPE_ERROR_ROUTINE</i> routine because the <a href="..\minitape\ne-minitape-_tape_status.md">TAPE_STATUS</a> codes set by the tape class driver are appropriate.

For some devices, however, a tape miniclass driver can identify a more appropriate error code than the tape class driver. For example, if the tape class driver returns TAPE_STATUS_BUS_RESET, the tape miniclass driver might be able to determine that the real problem is more accurately represented by TAPE_STATUS_NO_MEDIA for some devices.

A tape miniclass driver optionally specifies an entry point for its <i>TAPE_ERROR_ROUTINE</i> routine in the TAPE_INIT_DATA_EX structure it passes to <a href="..\minitape\nf-minitape-tapeclassinitialize.md">TapeClassInitialize</a> from its <b>DriverEntry</b> routine. For such a miniclass driver, when an error occurs during a read, write, or device-control command, the tape class driver sets an appropriate TAPE_STATUS code and calls the miniclass driver's <i>TAPE_ERROR_ROUTINE</i> routine with the minitape extension, the failed SRB, and the TAPE_STATUS code that would be returned.

<i>TAPE_ERROR_ROUTINE</i> determines whether to alter the status provided by the tape class driver based on the input parameters and its knowledge of the device. If the SRB_STATUS_AUTOSENSE_VALID bit is set in <b>Srb-&gt;SrbStatus</b>, then the SRB contains SCSI sense information at <b>SenseInfoBuffer</b>. The length of the buffer is <b>SenseInfoBufferLength</b>. The <i>TAPE_ERROR_ROUTINE</i> routine should examine this information along with the <b>SrbStatus</b> and <b>ScsiStatus</b> in the SRB to determine whether to change the TAPE_STATUS returned.
