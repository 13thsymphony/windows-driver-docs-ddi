# _TAPE_WMI_OPERATIONS structure
The tape miniclass driver passes this structure to its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567957">TapeMiniWMIControl</a> routine to indicate which WMI operation must be performed by the device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _TAPE_WMI_OPERATIONS {
  ULONG Method;
  ULONG DataBufferSize;
  PVOID DataBuffer;
} TAPE_WMI_OPERATIONS, *PTAPE_WMI_OPERATIONS;
````

## Members


`DataBuffer`

Pointer to a buffer in which the tape minidriver returns the results of the operation. The first <b>sizeof</b>(ULONG) bytes of <b>DataBuffer</b> contain a value of type <a href="..\minitape\ne-minitape-_tape_drive_problem_type.md">TAPE_DRIVE_PROBLEM_TYPE</a>, followed by <b>DataBufferSize</b> - <b>sizeof</b>(ULONG) bytes of tape data.

`DataBufferSize`

Indicates the size in bytes of the buffer in which the tape minidriver returns the results of the operation.

`Method`

Indicates the operation to be performed by the tape device. The operations allowed are as follows:





#### TAPE_CHECK_FOR_DRIVE_PROBLEM

If the tape drive supports commands to return specific device errors, such as tape alerts, the minidriver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567957">TapeMiniWMIControl</a> routine should execute the TAPE_QUERY_DEVICE_ERROR_DATA method Otherwise, it should execute the TAPE_QUERY_IO_ERROR_DATA method.





#### TAPE_QUERY_DEVICE_ERROR_DATA

Returns specific device errors, such as tape alerts. Not all tape drives support this method.





#### TAPE_QUERY_IO_ERROR_DATA

Returns general I/O error data, such as read/write errors, based on the I/O error count. All tape drives support this method.
