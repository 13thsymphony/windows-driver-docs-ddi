# TapeClassPhysicalBlockToLogicalBlock function
The <b>TapeClassPhysicalBlockToLogicalBlock</b> routine translates a physical block address to a pseudological block address. This routine is for SCSI-1 devices.

## Syntax

````
ULONG TapeClassPhysicalBlockToLogicalBlock(
  _In_ UCHAR   DensityCode,
  _In_ ULONG   PhysicalBlockAddress,
  _In_ ULONG   BlockLength,
  _In_ BOOLEAN FromBOT
);
````

## Parameters

`DensityCode`

Specifies the tape media density code. This routine supports tapes with the following density codes: QIC_24, QIC_120, QIC_150, QIC_525, QIC_1000, QIC_2GB, QIC_1350, and QIC_2100.

`PhysicalBlockAddress`

Specifies the physical block address obtained by a SCSI READ POSITION command.

`BlockLength`

Specifies the logical block size, in bytes.

`FromBOT`

<b>TRUE</b> indicates that the logical block calculation should start at the beginning of the tape and account for the physical device header. <b>FALSE</b> indicates that the tape has two partitions, that the block address is on the directory partition, and therefore no physical device header needs to be factored into the calculation.


## Return Value

<b>TapeClassPhysicalBlockToLogicalBlock</b> returns the logical block address.

## Remarks

A tape miniclass driver calls <b>TapeClassPhysicalBlockToLogicalBlock</b> to translate a physical block address from a tape device to a logical block address for an application. <b>TapeClassPhysicalBlockToLogicalBlock</b> is not necessary for SCSI-2 or later drivers because devices that comply with SCSI-2 or later standards support logical block addressing.

If a tape miniclass driver calls this routine with an unsupported tape density code, <b>TapeClassPhysicalBlockToLogicalBlock </b>returns the physical block address in the return value, without performing any translation.
