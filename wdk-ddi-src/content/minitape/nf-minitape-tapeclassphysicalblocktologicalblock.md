# TapeClassPhysicalBlockToLogicalBlock function



## -description
The <b>TapeClassPhysicalBlockToLogicalBlock</b> routine translates a physical block address to a pseudological block address. This routine is for SCSI-1 devices.



## -syntax

````
ULONG TapeClassPhysicalBlockToLogicalBlock(
  _In_ UCHAR   DensityCode,
  _In_ ULONG   PhysicalBlockAddress,
  _In_ ULONG   BlockLength,
  _In_ BOOLEAN FromBOT
);
````


## -parameters

### -param DensityCode [in]

Specifies the tape media density code. This routine supports tapes with the following density codes: QIC_24, QIC_120, QIC_150, QIC_525, QIC_1000, QIC_2GB, QIC_1350, and QIC_2100.


### -param PhysicalBlockAddress [in]

Specifies the physical block address obtained by a SCSI READ POSITION command.


### -param BlockLength [in]

Specifies the logical block size, in bytes.


### -param FromBOT [in]

<b>TRUE</b> indicates that the logical block calculation should start at the beginning of the tape and account for the physical device header. <b>FALSE</b> indicates that the tape has two partitions, that the block address is on the directory partition, and therefore no physical device header needs to be factored into the calculation.


## -returns
<b>TapeClassPhysicalBlockToLogicalBlock</b> returns the logical block address.


## -remarks
A tape miniclass driver calls <b>TapeClassPhysicalBlockToLogicalBlock</b> to translate a physical block address from a tape device to a logical block address for an application. <b>TapeClassPhysicalBlockToLogicalBlock</b> is not necessary for SCSI-2 or later drivers because devices that comply with SCSI-2 or later standards support logical block addressing.

If a tape miniclass driver calls this routine with an unsupported tape density code, <b>TapeClassPhysicalBlockToLogicalBlock </b>returns the physical block address in the return value, without performing any translation.
