# IWDFInterrupt::AcquireInterruptLock method



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]</p>
<p>The <b>AcquireInterruptLock</b> method begins a code sequence that executes while holding an interrupt object's lock.</p>


## -syntax

````
void AcquireInterruptLock();
````


## -parameters


## -returns
<p>This method does not return a value.</p>

<p>This method does not return a value.</p>

<p>This method does not return a value.</p>

## -remarks
<p>When a driver calls <b>AcquireInterruptLock</b>, the system acquires the framework's interrupt lock.</p>

<p>When the driver calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451319">ReleaseInterruptLock</a>, the system releases the interrupt lock.</p>

<p>You can use <b>AcquireInterruptLock</b> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451319">ReleaseInterruptLock</a> if your driver must execute a few lines of code without being preempted and with interrupt servicing disabled.</p>

<p>

Your driver cannot call <b>AcquireInterruptLock</b> before the framework has called the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6C091427-59FF-4101-ACD6-353C959794F6">OnInterruptEnable</a> callback function or after the framework has called the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3ADBD4C2-075E-4988-BF13-EB0C3E0C02BF">OnInterruptDisable</a> callback function.

After your driver calls <b>AcquireInterruptLock</b>, it must not call the method again for the same interrupt object before calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451319">ReleaseInterruptLock</a>.

</p>

<p>When running in an arbitrary thread, such as an I/O queue callback method, drivers must call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4A109CDF-C5DE-4BAE-AA4E-294EA5CE86C5">IWDFInterrupt::TryToAcquireInterruptLock</a> instead of <b>IWDFInterrupt::AcquireInterruptLock</b>. For example, the driver calls <b>IWDFInterrupt::TryToAcquireInterruptLock</b> from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556875">IQueueCallbackRead::OnRead</a>.</p>

<p>Doing so avoids the possibility of deadlock, as described in the following scenario.</p>

<p>The driver must not attempt to acquire the lock recursively. If connected to the debugger, the framework introduces a breakpoint in this scenario.</p>
