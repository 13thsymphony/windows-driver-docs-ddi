# _PosBarcodeScannerDataReceivedEventData structure
This structure contains the scanned data that is passed to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn757463">BarcodeScannerDataReceived</a> event.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct _PosBarcodeScannerDataReceivedEventData {
  PosEventDataHeader Header;
  UINT32             DataType;
  UINT32             ScanDataLength;
  UINT32             ScanDataLabelLength;
} PosBarcodeScannerDataReceivedEventData;
```

## Members


`Header`

The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn772232">PosEventDataHeader</a> header information for this event.

`DataType`

Indicates which <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn757474">BarcodeSymbology</a> is associated with the scan data.

`ScanDataLength`

Indicates the number of bytes of raw scanned data.

`ScanDataLabelLength`

Indicates the number of bytes of decoded scan data. A label is the decoded scan data in which the header and footer information has been removed, leaving only the raw scanner data.

## Remarks
<i>ScanDataLength</i> bytes of scan data immediately follows the <i>PosBarcodeScannerDataReceivedEventData</i> structure, followed by <i>ScanDataLabelLength</i> bytes of label data.
