# _PosBarcodeScannerDataReceivedEventData structure



## -description
This structure contains the scanned data that is passed to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn757463">BarcodeScannerDataReceived</a> event.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _PosBarcodeScannerDataReceivedEventData {
  PosEventDataHeader Header;
  UINT32             DataType;
  UINT32             ScanDataLength;
  UINT32             ScanDataLabelLength;
} PosBarcodeScannerDataReceivedEventData;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Header

The <a href="..\pointofservicedriverinterface\ns-pointofservicedriverinterface-_poseventdataheader.md">PosEventDataHeader</a> header information for this event.


### -field DataType

Indicates which <a href="..\pointofservicecommontypes\ne-pointofservicecommontypes-_barcodesymbology.md">BarcodeSymbology</a> is associated with the scan data.


### -field ScanDataLength

Indicates the number of bytes of raw scanned data.


### -field ScanDataLabelLength

Indicates the number of bytes of decoded scan data. A label is the decoded scan data in which the header and footer information has been removed, leaving only the raw scanner data. 


## -remarks
<i>ScanDataLength</i> bytes of scan data immediately follows the <i>PosBarcodeScannerDataReceivedEventData</i> structure, followed by <i>ScanDataLabelLength</i> bytes of label data.</p>
