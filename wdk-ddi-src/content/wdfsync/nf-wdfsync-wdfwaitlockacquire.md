# WdfWaitLockAcquire function
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]

The <b>WdfWaitLockAcquire</b> method acquires a specified wait lock.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS WdfWaitLockAcquire(
  _In_     WDFWAITLOCK Lock,
  _In_opt_ PLONGLONG   Timeout
);
````

## Parameters

`Lock`

A handle to a framework wait-lock object, obtained by a previous call to <a href="..\wdfsync\nf-wdfsync-wdfwaitlockcreate.md">WdfWaitLockCreate</a>.

`Timeout`

An optional pointer to a time-out value. The time-out value is specified in system time units (100-nanosecond intervals).

 If the pointer is non-<b>NULL</b>, the framework cancels the attempt to obtain the lock if it is not completed within the specified time-out period. Time-out values can be negative, positive, or zero, as follows:
<ul>
<li>
If the time-out value is negative, the expiration time is relative to the current system time.

</li>
<li>
If the time-out value is positive, the expiration time is specified as an absolute time (which is actually relative to January 1, 1601). 

</li>
<li>
If the time-out value is zero, <b>WdfWaitLockAcquire</b> attempts to acquire the lock and then returns immediately, whether it has acquired the lock or not. 

</li>
</ul>Relative expiration times are not affected by any changes to the system time that might occur within the specified time-out period. Absolute expiration times do reflect system time changes.

The framework provides <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/E7D5564D-7BAA-412E-959F-3655B963B4C1">time conversion functions</a> that convert time values into system time units.

If the caller supplies a <b>NULL</b> pointer, the method waits indefinitely until it has acquired the lock.


## Return Value

<b>WdfWaitLockAcquire</b> can return the following <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557697">NTSTATUS values</a>:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The caller has acquired the wait lock.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_TIMEOUT</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The specified <i>Timeout</i> interval expired before the lock was acquired.

</td>
</tr>
</table> 

Note that <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fe823930-e3ff-4c95-a640-bb6470c95d1d">NT_SUCCESS</a>(status) equals <b>TRUE</b> for all of these status values.



The caller does not have to check the return value if the <i>Timeout</i> pointer is <b>NULL</b>, because in that case <b>WdfWaitLockAcquire</b> returns only after it acquires the lock.



A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.

## Remarks

The <b>WdfWaitLockAcquire</b> method does not return until it acquires the wait lock or until the time-out period expires. 

<b>WdfWaitLockAcquire</b> calls <a href="..\ntddk\nf-ntddk-keentercriticalregion.md">KeEnterCriticalRegion</a> before acquiring the wait lock.  As a result, when the method returns, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/74ed953c-1b2a-40b9-9df3-16869b198b38">normal kernel APCs</a> are disabled. <b>WdfWaitLockAcquire</b> does not alter the caller's IRQL.

If the <i>Timeout</i> pointer is <b>NULL</b>, or if the time-out value is not zero, <b>WdfWaitLockAcquire</b> must be called at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL.

If the time-out value is zero, <b>WdfWaitLockAcquire</b> must be called at IRQL &lt; DISPATCH_LEVEL. Note that this is in disagreement with the header file (wdfsync.h), which indicates that this method can be called at DISPATCH_LEVEL.
