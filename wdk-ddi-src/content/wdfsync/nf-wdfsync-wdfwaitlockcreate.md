# WdfWaitLockCreate function
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]

The <b>WdfWaitLockCreate</b> method creates a framework wait-lock object.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS WdfWaitLockCreate(
  _In_opt_ PWDF_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES LockAttributes,
  _Out_    WDFWAITLOCK            *Lock
);
````

## Parameters

`LockAttributes`

A pointer to a caller-allocated <a href="..\wdfobject\ns-wdfobject-_wdf_object_attributes.md">WDF_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES</a> structure that specifies attributes for the wait-lock object. This parameter is optional and can be WDF_NO_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES.

`Lock`

A pointer to a location that receives a handle to a new framework wait-lock object.


## Return Value

<b>WdfWaitLockCreate</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. 

For a list of other return values that the <b>WdfWaitLockCreate</b> method might return, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f5345c88-1c3a-4b32-9c93-c252713f7641">Framework Object Creation Errors</a>.

This method also might return other <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557697">NTSTATUS values</a>.

## Remarks

The <b>WdfWaitLockCreate</b> method creates a framework wait-lock object. After creating a wait-lock object, a driver can call <a href="..\wdfsync\nf-wdfsync-wdfwaitlockacquire.md">WdfWaitLockAcquire</a> to acquire the lock and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556116">WdfWaitLockRelease</a> to release the lock.

By default, the new wait-lock object's parent is the framework driver object that the <a href="..\wdfdriver\nf-wdfdriver-wdfdrivercreate.md">WdfDriverCreate</a> method created. You can use the <b>ParentObject</b> member of the <a href="..\wdfobject\ns-wdfobject-_wdf_object_attributes.md">WDF_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES</a> structure to specify a different parent. The framework deletes the wait-lock object when it deletes the parent object. If your driver does not change the default parent, the driver should delete the wait-lock object when it has finished using the object; otherwise, the object will remain until the I/O manager unloads your driver. 

For more information about wait locks, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/synchronization-techniques-for-wdf-drivers">Synchronization Techniques for Framework-Based Drivers</a>.
