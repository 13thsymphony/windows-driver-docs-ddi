# VideoPortReleaseBuffer function
The <b>VideoPortReleaseBuffer</b> function is <b>obsolete</b> in Windows 2000 and later. In its place, video miniport drivers should instead use <a href="..\video\nf-video-videoportfreepool.md">VideoPortFreePool</a>. 

<b>VideoPortReleaseBuffer</b> deallocates a block of paged pool memory.

## Syntax

````
VOID VideoPortReleaseBuffer(
  _In_ PVOID HwDeviceExtension,
  _In_ PVOID Buffer
);
````

## Parameters

`HwDeviceExtension`

Pointer to the miniport driver's device extension.

`Buffer`

Specifies the address of the block of pool memory being deallocated.


## Return Value

## Remarks

This function releases memory allocated by <a href="..\video\nf-video-videoportallocatebuffer.md">VideoPortAllocateBuffer</a>. A miniport driver must not access the memory block to which <i>Buffer</i> points after it has been freed.
