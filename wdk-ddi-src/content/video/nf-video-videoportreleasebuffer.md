# VideoPortReleaseBuffer function
The <b>VideoPortReleaseBuffer</b> function is <b>obsolete</b> in Windows 2000 and later. In its place, video miniport drivers should instead use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff570301">VideoPortFreePool</a>. 

<b>VideoPortReleaseBuffer</b> deallocates a block of paged pool memory.

## Syntax

```
VIDEOPORT_API VOID VideoPortReleaseBuffer(
  IN PVOID HwDeviceExtension,
  IN PVOID Buffer
);
```

## Parameters

`HwDeviceExtension`

Pointer to the miniport driver's device extension.

`Buffer`

Specifies the address of the block of pool memory being deallocated.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

This function releases memory allocated by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff570177">VideoPortAllocateBuffer</a>. A miniport driver must not access the memory block to which <i>Buffer</i> points after it has been freed.
