# VideoPortWaitForSingleObject function



## -description
The <b>VideoPortWaitForSingleObject</b> function puts the current thread into a wait state until the given dispatch object is set to the signaled state, or (optionally) until the wait times out.



## -syntax

````
VP_STATUS VideoPortWaitForSingleObject(
  _In_ PVOID          HwDeviceExtension,
  _In_ PVOID          Object,
  _In_ PLARGE_INTEGER Timeout
);
````


## -parameters

### -param HwDeviceExtension [in]

Pointer to the miniport driver's device extension.


### -param Object [in]

Pointer to the event object.


### -param Timeout [in]

(Optional) Pointer to a time-out value that specifies the absolute or relative time at which the wait is to be completed. A negative value specifies a wait interval relative to the current time. The value should be expressed in units of 100 nanoseconds. Absolute expiration times track any changes in the system time; relative expiration times are not affected by system time changes.


## -returns
<b>VideoPortWaitForSingleObject</b> returns one of the following values:
<dl>
<dt><b>ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER</b></dt>
</dl>One of the parameters is invalid or the call attempted to wait for a mapped user event.
<dl>
<dt><b>NO_ERROR</b></dt>
</dl>The event object specified in the <i>pObject</i> parameter satisfied the wait.
<dl>
<dt><b>WAIT_TIMEOUT</b></dt>
</dl>A time-out occurred before the event object was set to the signaled state. This value can be returned when the specified set of wait conditions cannot be immediately met and <i>Timeout</i> is set to zero.

 


## -remarks
The miniport driver should not attempt to wait for a mapped user event.

Callers of <b>VideoPortWaitForSingleObject</b> must be running at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL. Usually, the caller will be running at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL and in a nonarbitrary thread context. A call to this function while running at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL is valid if and only if the caller specifies a <i>Timeout</i> value of zero. That is, a miniport driver must not wait for a nonzero interval at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL.
