# _DDC_CONTROL structure
The DDC_CONTROL structure holds function pointers and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/0dd010e7-3e10-422a-adcb-8fe7df9e29ab">EDID</a> segment information needed by the <a href="..\video\nf-video-videoportddcmonitorhelper.md">VideoPortDDCMonitorHelper</a> function, which is exported by the video port driver. The <a href="..\video\nc-video-pvideo_hw_get_child_descriptor.md">HwVidGetVideoChildDescriptor</a> function, implemented by the video miniport driver, can call <b>VideoPortDDCMonitorHelper</b> for assistance in reading the EDID blocks from its child monitor devices.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DDC_CONTROL {
  ULONG         Size;
  I2C_CALLBACKS I2CCallbacks;
  UCHAR         EdidSegment;
} DDC_CONTROL, *PDDC_CONTROL;
````

## Members


`EdidSegment`

Specifies the particular EDID segment. Currently, this member is meaningful only for EEDID (EDID Version 1.3); for other EDID versions, this member should always be set to 0. For EEDID (EDID Version 1.3), segment numbers can range from 0 through 127, where each segment is 256 bytes in length. Since the EDID version number is in segment 0, this member must be set to 0 the first time  the video miniport driver calls <a href="..\video\nf-video-videoportddcmonitorhelper.md">VideoPortDDCMonitorHelper</a> regarding a particular monitor.

`I2CCallbacks`

Is an <a href="..\video\ns-video-_i2c_callbacks.md">I2C_CALLBACKS</a> structure that contains pointers to functions, implemented by the video miniport driver, that read and write individual data bits to the I2C serial clock and data lines.

`Size`

Specifies the size, in bytes, of this DDC_CONTROL structure.
