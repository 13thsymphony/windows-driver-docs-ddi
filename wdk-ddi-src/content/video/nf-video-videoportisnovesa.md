# VideoPortIsNoVesa function
The <b>VideoPortIsNoVesa</b> function determines whether a video miniport driver that does not support Plug and Play (PnP) is restricted to legacy VGA resources.

## Syntax

````
BOOLEAN VideoPortIsNoVesa(void);
````

## Parameters

This function has no parameters.

## Return Value

If <b>VideoPortIsNoVesa</b> returns <b>TRUE</b>, then a non-PnP video miniport driver must restrict its hardware access to legacy VGA resources. Otherwise, the video miniport driver is permitted to use non-legacy VGA resources.

## Remarks

This function is useful only to vga.sys, which is a system-supplied video miniport driver that does not support PnP. This function provides no pertinent information to video miniport drivers that support PnP and therefore is no use to IHVs.

If <b>VideoPortIsNoVesa</b> returns <b>TRUE</b>, then the video miniport driver must access the display adapter only through legacy VGA resources (I/O 3B0 through 3DF; memory A0000 through BFFFF). Specifically, if <b>VideoPortIsNoVesa</b> returns <b>TRUE</b>, the video miniport driver must not attempt to call the Int10 functions, which are implemented by the video port driver.

For more information about the Int10 functions, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567732">Int10 Functions Implemented by the Video Port Driver</a>.
