# VideoPortFreeCommonBuffer function
The <b>VideoPortFreeCommonBuffer</b> function is <b>obsolete</b> and is supported only for backward compatibility with existing drivers. In its place, driver writers should use <a href="..\video\nf-video-videoportreleasecommonbuffer.md">VideoPortReleaseCommonBuffer</a>.

<b>VideoPortFreeCommonBuffer</b> deallocates system memory that was allocated by a call to <a href="..\video\nf-video-videoportgetcommonbuffer.md">VideoPortGetCommonBuffer</a>.

## Syntax

````
VOID VideoPortFreeCommonBuffer(
  _In_ PVOID            HwDeviceExtension,
  _In_ ULONG            Length,
  _In_ PVOID            VirtualAddress,
  _In_ PHYSICAL_ADDRESS LogicalAddress,
  _In_ BOOLEAN          CacheEnabled
);
````

## Parameters

`HwDeviceExtension`

Pointer to the miniport driver's device extension.

`Length`

Specifies the number of bytes of memory to be freed.

`VirtualAddress`

Pointer to the corresponding virtual address of the allocated memory range.

`LogicalAddress`

Specifies the logical address of the buffer to be freed.

`CacheEnabled`

Indicates whether the allocated memory is cached.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

Except for <a href="..\video\nf-video-videoportgetcommonbuffer.md">VideoPortGetCommonBuffer's </a><i>Alignment</i> parameter, all of the parameters used in a call to <b>VideoPortFreeCommonBuffer</b> must have the same values as those used in the previous call to <b>VideoPortGetCommonBuffer</b>.
