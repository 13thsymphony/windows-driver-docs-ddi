# PMINIPORT_DPC_ROUTINE callback function
<i>The HwVidDpcRoutine</i> function is a miniport driver-implemented callback that is called when a queued DPC gets scheduled.

## Syntax

```
PMINIPORT_DPC_ROUTINE PminiportDpcRoutine;

void PminiportDpcRoutine(
  IN PVOID HwDeviceExtension,
  IN PVOID Context
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`HwDeviceExtension`

Pointer to the miniport driver's hardware device extension. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543119">Device Extensions</a>.

`Context`

Contains any miniport driver-supplied data this function may need. <i>Context</i> can be <b>NULL</b> if the DPC implementation does not require additional information.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

The miniport driver queues this DPC by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff570339">VideoPortQueueDpc</a>.

Because <i>HwVidDpcRoutine </i>is called at DISPATCH_LEVEL, it must not manipulate any pageable code or data. Further, this function must be in nonpaged memory and should complete its operations as quickly as possible.
