# PMINIPORT_DPC_ROUTINE callback



## -description
<i>The HwVidDpcRoutine</i> function is a miniport driver-implemented callback that is called when a queued DPC gets scheduled.



## -prototype

````
PMINIPORT_DPC_ROUTINE HwVidDpcRoutine;

VOID HwVidDpcRoutine(
  _In_ PVOID HwDeviceExtension,
  _In_ PVOID Context
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param HwDeviceExtension [in]

Pointer to the miniport driver's hardware device extension. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543119">Device Extensions</a>.


### -param Context [in]

Contains any miniport driver-supplied data this function may need. <i>Context</i> can be <b>NULL</b> if the DPC implementation does not require additional information.


## -returns
None


## -remarks
The miniport driver queues this DPC by calling <a href="..\video\nf-video-videoportqueuedpc.md">VideoPortQueueDpc</a>.

Because <i>HwVidDpcRoutine </i>is called at DISPATCH_LEVEL, it must not manipulate any pageable code or data. Further, this function must be in nonpaged memory and should complete its operations as quickly as possible.
