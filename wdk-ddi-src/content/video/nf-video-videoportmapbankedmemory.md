# VideoPortMapBankedMemory function
The <b>VideoPortMapBankedMemory</b> function is <b>obsolete</b>, and is supported only for Windows NT 4.0 and previous drivers. Windows 2000 and later drivers must use <a href="..\video\nf-video-videoportmapmemory.md">VideoPortMapMemory</a>.

<b>VideoPortMapBankedMemory</b> remaps a bus-relative physical range of video memory into the corresponding display driver's virtual address space in response to a VRP with the <b>IoControlCode</b> member set to <a href="..\ntddvdeo\ni-ntddvdeo-ioctl_video_share_video_memory.md">IOCTL_VIDEO_SHARE_VIDEO_MEMORY</a> or <a href="..\ntddvdeo\ni-ntddvdeo-ioctl_video_map_video_memory.md">IOCTL_VIDEO_MAP_VIDEO_MEMORY</a>.

## Syntax

````
VP_STATUS VideoPortMapBankedMemory(
   PVOID                   HwDeviceExtension,
   PHYSICAL_ADDRESS        PhysicalAddress,
   PULONG                  Length,
   PULONG                  InIoSpace,
   PVOID                   *VirtualAddress,
   ULONG                   BankLength,
   UCHAR                   ReadWriteBank,
   PBANKED_SECTION_ROUTINE BankRoutine,
   PVOID                   Context
);
````

## Parameters

`HwDeviceExtension`

Pointer to the miniport driver's device extension.

`PhysicalAddress`

Specifies the bus-relative base address of the range to be mapped.

`Length`

Pointer to a variable specifying the total number of bytes of device memory to be mapped (regardless of bank size). <b>VideoPortMapBankedMemory</b> returns the actual size of the memory mapped, which can be rounded to a system-determined alignment boundary, in this parameter. However, the miniport and display drivers cannot access memory outside the range delimited by the input value at <i>Length</i>.

`InIoSpace`

Indicates the location of the range. This parameter can be one of the following values:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
VIDEO_MEMORY_SPACE_DENSE

</td>
<td>
Obsolete

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
VIDEO_MEMORY_SPACE_IO

</td>
<td>
The range is in system I/O space rather than in memory space.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
VIDEO_MEMORY_SPACE_MEMORY

</td>
<td>
The range is in memory space rather than in system I/O space.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
VIDEO_MEMORY_SPACE_P6CACHE

</td>
<td>
The processor aggregates a sequence of write operations and sends them to a given cache line. The processor then flushes the cache. This flag is meaningful only when VIDEO_MEMORY_SPACE_IO is <i>not</i> set.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
VIDEO_MEMORY_SPACE_USER_MODE

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the address range specified should be mapped into user mode rather than kernel mode. This flag is meaningful only when VIDEO_MEMORY_SPACE_IO is <i>not</i> set.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`VirtualAddress`

Is a handle to the process into which the memory must be mapped, or <b>NULL</b>. <b>NULL</b> specifies that the port driver should map the logical memory range at any location in the address space of the current process. Otherwise, this handle can be a value passed in a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a1de1905-09f3-4689-ace9-06690a1f930a">VRP</a> by the miniport driver's corresponding display driver. On return from a successful call, <b>VideoPortMapBankedMemory</b> resets the variable to the base virtual address to which it has mapped the given <i>PhysicalAddress</i>.

`BankLength`

Specifies the size of a bank, in bytes.

`ReadWriteBank`

If set to <b>TRUE</b> the bank is Read\Write; if set to <b>FALSE</b> there are two independent read and write banks.

`BankRoutine`

Pointer to a driver-supplied <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567322">HwVidBankedMemoryCallback</a> function to be called by the Memory Manager when a new bank is accessed by the display driver.

`Context`

Pointer to a miniport driver-supplied context that is passed back to the driver when the <i>BankRoutine</i> is called.


## Return Value

<b>VideoPortMapBankedMemory</b> returns NO_ERROR if the given logical range was successfully mapped to a user-space virtual range. Otherwise, it can return ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER.

## Remarks

<b>VideoPortMapBankedMemory</b> runs in kernel mode within the same context as the user-mode thread that initiated the call.

<b>VideoPortMapBankedMemory</b> is called by miniport drivers to efficiently manage x86 type devices that are limited to mapping a frame buffer in banks. When this routine returns to the caller, the frame buffer managed by the miniport driver is mapped as a linear frame buffer into the address space of the requesting process (see <i>VirtualAddress</i> parameter). When an access is made to an address in that mapped space, the Memory Manager calls the miniport driver to update the Bank Index Register to point to a new bank that contains the currently referenced address. The Bank Index Register is maintained by the miniport driver in <i>BankRoutine</i>. The correct Bank Index is calculated by the Memory Manager transparently to a display driver and passed to the miniport driver in the callback to <i>BankRoutine</i>.
