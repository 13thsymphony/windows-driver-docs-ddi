# VideoPortAcquireSpinLockAtDpcLevel function



## -description
The <b>VideoPortAcquireSpinLockAtDpcLevel</b> function acquires a spin lock when the caller is already running at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL.


## -syntax

````
VOID VideoPortAcquireSpinLockAtDpcLevel(
  _Inout_ PVOID      HwDeviceExtension,
  _In_    PSPIN_LOCK SpinLock
);
````


## -parameters

### -param HwDeviceExtension [in, out]

Pointer to the miniport driver's device extension.

### -param SpinLock [in]

Pointer to a memory location that contains the spin lock.

## -returns
None

## -remarks
Miniport drivers call <b>VideoPortAcquireSpinLockAtDpcLevel</b> instead of <a href="display.videoportacquirespinlock">VideoPortAcquireSpinLock</a> for better driver performance if and only if they are already running at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL.

If a miniport driver is running at IRQL &lt; DISPATCH_LEVEL, it should call <b>VideoPortAcquireSpinLock</b> to have IRQL raised by that routine. <b>VideoPortAcquireSpinLockAtDpcLevel</b> requires the caller to be running already at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL, so no raise is necessary.

The caller should release the spin lock with <a href="display.videoportreleasespinlockfromdpclevel">VideoPortReleaseSpinLockFromDpcLevel</a> as quickly as possible.
