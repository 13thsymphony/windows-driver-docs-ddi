# VideoPortAcquireSpinLock function
The <b>VideoPortAcquireSpinLock</b> function obtains the specified spin lock.

## Syntax

````
VOID VideoPortAcquireSpinLock(
  _Inout_ PVOID      HwDeviceExtension,
  _In_    PSPIN_LOCK SpinLock,
  _Out_   PUCHAR     OldIrql
);
````

## Parameters

`HwDeviceExtension`

Pointer to the miniport driver's device extension.

`Arg1`



`OldIrql`

Pointer to a memory location that will receive the current IRQL.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

The current IRQL is saved in <i>OldIrql</i>. Then, the current IRQL is reset to DISPATCH_LEVEL, and the specified spin lock is acquired.

The <i>OldIrql</i> value must be specified when the spin lock is released with <a href="..\video\nf-video-videoportreleasespinlock.md">VideoPortReleaseSpinLock</a>.

Spin locks can cause serious problems if not used judiciously. In particular, no deadlock protection is performed and dispatching is disabled while the spin lock is held. Therefore: 
<ul>
<li>
The code within a critical region guarded by a spin lock must neither be pageable nor make any references to pageable data. 

</li>
<li>
The code within a critical region guarded by a spin lock can neither call any external function that might access pageable data or raise an exception, nor can it generate any exceptions. 

</li>
<li>
The caller should release the spin lock with <b>VideoPortReleaseSpinLock</b> as quickly as possible. 

</li>
</ul>
