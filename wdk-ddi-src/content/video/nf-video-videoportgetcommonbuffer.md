# VideoPortGetCommonBuffer function
The <b>VideoPortGetCommonBuffer</b> function is <b>obsolete</b> in Windows XP and later, and is supported only for backward compatibility with existing drivers. In its place, driver writers should use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff570178">VideoPortAllocateCommonBuffer</a>.

<b>VideoPortGetCommonBuffer</b> allocates and maps system memory so that it is simultaneously accessible from both the processor and a device for common-buffer DMA operations.

## Syntax

```
VIDEOPORT_API PVOID VideoPortGetCommonBuffer(
  IN PVOID              HwDeviceExtension,
  IN ULONG              DesiredLength,
  IN ULONG              Alignment,
  OUT PPHYSICAL_ADDRESS LogicalAddress,
  OUT PULONG            pActualLength,
  IN BOOLEAN            CacheEnabled
);
```

## Parameters

`HwDeviceExtension`

Pointer to the miniport driver's device extension.

`DesiredLength`

Specifies the requested number of bytes of memory.

`Alignment`

Specifies the requested alignment of the buffer. The video port driver currently ignores this parameter.

`LogicalAddress`

Pointer to a variable that receives the logical address to be used by the adapter to access the allocated buffer.

`pActualLength`

Pointer to a variable that receives the actual size, in bytes, of the buffer allocated for this request.

`CacheEnabled`

Specifies whether the allocated memory can be cached.


## Return Value

<b>VideoPortGetCommonBuffer</b> returns the base virtual address of the allocated buffer if successful; otherwise, returns <b>NULL</b> if the buffer cannot be allocated.

## Remarks

See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fe6c2e16-d222-4948-b1df-34ed8d57d9d8">Bus-Master DMA in Video Miniport Drivers</a> for information about packet-based and common-buffer DMA transfers.
