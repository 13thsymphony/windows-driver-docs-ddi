# VideoPortReleaseDeviceLock function
The <b>VideoPortReleaseDeviceLock</b> function releases the device lock acquired in a prior call to <a href="..\video\nf-video-videoportacquiredevicelock.md">VideoPortAcquireDeviceLock</a>.

## Syntax

````
VOID VideoPortReleaseDeviceLock(
  _In_ PVOID HwDeviceExtension
);
````

## Parameters

`HwDeviceExtension`

Pointer to the miniport driver's device extension.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

Typically, the video port driver guarantees threaded synchronization into the miniport driver by using of a device lock. However, a miniport driver must perform its own synchronization when being accessed by a child device; that is, a miniport driver must perform synchronization in routines that it exposes through <a href="..\video\nc-video-pvideo_hw_query_interface.md">HwVidQueryInterface</a>. The miniport driver does this by calling <a href="..\video\nf-video-videoportacquiredevicelock.md">VideoPortAcquireDeviceLock</a> to acquire the device lock maintained by the video port driver.

The miniport driver should call <b>VideoPortReleaseDeviceLock</b> to release the device lock as quickly as possible.
