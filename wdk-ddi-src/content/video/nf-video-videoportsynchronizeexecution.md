# VideoPortSynchronizeExecution function
The <b>VideoPortSynchronizeExecution</b> function synchronizes the execution of a miniport driver-supplied <a href="..\video\nc-video-pminiport_synchronize_routine.md">HwVidSynchronizeExecutionCallback</a> function with the miniport driver's <a href="..\video\nc-video-pvideo_hw_interrupt.md">HwVidInterrupt</a> function, if any. Otherwise, it runs <i>HwVidSynchronizeExecutionCallback</i> at a raised priority.

## Syntax

````
BOOLEAN VideoPortSynchronizeExecution(
   PVOID                         HwDeviceExtension,
   VIDEO_SYNCHRONIZE_PRIORITY    Priority,
   PMINIPORT_SYNCHRONIZE_ROUTINE SynchronizeRoutine,
   PVOID                         Context
);
````

## Parameters

`HwDeviceExtension`

Pointer to the miniport driver's device extension.

`Priority`

Specifies the type of priority at which the given <i>SynchronizeRoutine</i> must be run, as one of the following:

<ul>
<li>
If <i>Priority</i> is set to <b>VpLowPriority</b>, the current thread is raised to the highest noninterrupt-masking priority. Accordingly, the current thread can be preempted only by an ISR if a device interrupts.

</li>
<li>
If <i>Priority</i> is set to <b>VpMediumPriority</b> and the miniport driver has an ISR associated with its video adapter, the call to the given <i>SynchronizeRoutine</i> is synchronized with the miniport driver's <a href="..\video\nc-video-pvideo_hw_interrupt.md">HwVidInterrupt</a> function. Otherwise, synchronization is made at the <b>VpLowPriority</b> level.

</li>
<li>
<b>VpHighPriority</b> has the same effect as <b>VpMediumPriority</b>.

</li>
</ul>

`SynchronizeRoutine`

Pointer to the miniport driver's <a href="..\video\nc-video-pminiport_synchronize_routine.md">HwVidSynchronizeExecutionCallback</a> function.

`Context`

Pointer to a caller-supplied context to be passed to the miniport driver's <i>HwVidSynchronizeExecutionCallback</i> function. This pointer can be <b>NULL</b>.


## Return Value

If the operation succeeds, <b>VideoPortSynchronizeExecution</b> returns <b>TRUE</b>.

## Remarks

Miniport drivers seldom call this routine unless either of the following conditions hold:

<ul>
<li>
The miniport driver's <a href="..\video\nc-video-pvideo_hw_interrupt.md">HwVidInterrupt</a> function shares memory with other miniport driver functions. In order to access the shared memory in a multiprocessor-safe way, such miniport driver functions must call <b>VideoPortSynchronizeExecution</b> with <a href="..\video\nc-video-pminiport_synchronize_routine.md">HwVidSynchronizeExecutionCallback</a>. This miniport driver function can safely access the shared memory because the video port driver prevents the <i>HwVidInterrupt</i> function from accessing the same memory concurrently.

</li>
<li>
The adapter must be programmed with a sequence of commands without being subject to a context switch. For example, a miniport driver's <i>SvgaHwIoPortXxx</i> function that has buffered a sequence of I/O instructions and validated the sequence might call <b>VideoPortSynchronizeExecution</b> with <i>HwVidSynchronizeExecutionCallback</i>. This miniport driver function can transfer the buffered and validated I/O stream to the adapter very quickly.

</li>
</ul>
A caller should specify the lowest practical <i>Priority</i> value for the work <a href="..\video\nc-video-pminiport_synchronize_routine.md">HwVidSynchronizeExecutionCallback</a> must do. Any <i>CallbackRoutine</i> that is run at a high hardware priority (<b>VpMediumPriority</b> or <b>VpHighPriority</b>) should return control as quickly as possible. A driver with such a high-priority <i>HwVidSynchronizeExecutionCallback</i> function should be designed to do as much work as possible in every other driver function except one of both of its <i>HwVidSynchronizeExecutionCallback</i> and <i>HwVidInterrupt</i> functions.

Callers of <b>VideoPortSynchronizeExecution</b> must be running at IRQL
