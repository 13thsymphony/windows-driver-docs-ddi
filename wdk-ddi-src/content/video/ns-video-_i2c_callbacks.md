# _I2C_CALLBACKS structure
The I2C_CALLBACKS structure contains pointers to functions, implemented by the video miniport driver, that read from and write to the serial data and serial clock lines of the I2C bus.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _I2C_CALLBACKS {
  PVIDEO_WRITE_CLOCK_LINE WriteClockLine;
  PVIDEO_WRITE_DATA_LINE  WriteDataLine;
  PVIDEO_READ_CLOCK_LINE  ReadClockLine;
  PVIDEO_READ_DATA_LINE   ReadDataLine;
} I2C_CALLBACKS, *PI2C_CALLBACKS;
````

## Members


`ReadClockLine`

A pointer to the <a href="..\video\nc-video-pvideo_read_clock_line.md">ReadClockLine</a> function implemented by the video miniport driver.

`ReadDataLine`
