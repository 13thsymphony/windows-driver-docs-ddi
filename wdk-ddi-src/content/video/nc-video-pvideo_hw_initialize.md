# PVIDEO_HW_INITIALIZE callback function
<i>HwVidInitialize</i> performs the first initialization of the adapter, after the HAL has given up control of the video hardware to the video port driver.

## Syntax

```
PVIDEO_HW_INITIALIZE PvideoHwInitialize;

BOOLEAN PvideoHwInitialize(
  PVOID HwDeviceExtension
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`HwDeviceExtension`

Pointer to the miniport driver's per-adapter storage area. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543119">Device Extensions</a>.


## Return Value

If the initialization succeeds, <i>HwVidInitialize</i> returns <b>TRUE</b>.

## Remarks

Every video miniport driver must have a <i>HwVidInitialize</i> function.

The video port driver calls <i>HwVidInitialize</i> in response to an open request by the corresponding display driver. As soon as <i>HwVidInitialize</i> is called, the miniport driver can change the state of the adapter, unlike the miniport driver's <a href="..\video\nc-video-pvideo_hw_find_adapter.md">HwVidFindAdapter</a> function, which must leave the adapter in VGA mode. On return from <i>HwVidInitialize</i>, the adapter must be initialized to a state equivalent to that set up by the miniport driver's <a href="..\video\nc-video-pvideo_hw_reset_hw.md">HwVidResetHw</a> function. This feature is used by autodetection to get mode information from the miniport driver.

If at all possible, <i>HwVidInitialize</i> should avoid programming the device hardware. The miniport driver will initialize the device later, when it is instructed to switch display modes.

<i>HwVidInitialize</i> should be made pageable.
