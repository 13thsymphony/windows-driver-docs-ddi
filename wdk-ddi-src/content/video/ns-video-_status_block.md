# _STATUS_BLOCK structure
The STATUS_BLOCK structure is a substructure within the VIDEO_REQUEST_PACKET structure. A miniport driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/82951291-cf3e-486b-ad0e-f347fefe0370">HwVidStartIO</a> function must set the status block of each <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a1de1905-09f3-4689-ace9-06690a1f930a">VRP</a> that it gets.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct _STATUS_BLOCK {
  union {
    PVOID     Pointer;
    VP_STATUS Status;
  };
  ULONG_PTR Information;
} *PSTATUS_BLOCK, STATUS_BLOCK;
```

## Members


`Information`

Supplies additional information about the completed operation. The meaning of the value varies according to VRP. Generally, this member is used to return the minimum size required for the input buffer if the VRP passes data in the <b>InputBuffer</b>. Alternatively, it contains the number of bytes of data transferred if the requested operation returns data in the VRP <b>OutputBuffer</b>.
