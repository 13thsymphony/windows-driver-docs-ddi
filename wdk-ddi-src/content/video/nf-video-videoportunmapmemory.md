# VideoPortUnmapMemory function



## -description
The <b>VideoPortUnmapMemory</b> function releases a mapping between a logical address range for the adapter and a virtual address range in the user-mode address space of a particular thread. This function is the complement of <a href="..\video\nf-video-videoportmapmemory.md">VideoPortMapMemory</a>.



## -syntax

````
VP_STATUS VideoPortUnmapMemory(
   PVOID  HwDeviceExtension,
   PVOID  VirtualAddress,
   HANDLE ProcessHandle
);
````


## -parameters

### -param HwDeviceExtension 

Pointer to the miniport driver's device extension.


### -param VirtualAddress 

Pointer to a virtual address within the mapped range to be released.


### -param ProcessHandle 

Should be set to zero, or to the process handle specified when the miniport driver called <b>VideoPortMapMemory</b>.


## -returns
<b>VideoPortUnmapMemory</b> returns NO_ERROR if the mapping was released. Otherwise, it returns ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER.


## -remarks
A miniport driver cannot release a subrange of the mapping between a logical device range and the user-space virtual address range of its corresponding display driver. Whether the <i>VirtualAddress</i> parameter is the base virtual address for the mapped range that was returned by <b>VideoPortMapMemory</b>, or is an offset into that mapped virtual range, <b>VideoPortUnmapMemory</b> releases the mapping for the full range.
