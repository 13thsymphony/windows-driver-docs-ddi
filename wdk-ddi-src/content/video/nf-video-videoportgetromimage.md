# VideoPortGetRomImage function
Reads the device's read-only memory (ROM).

## Syntax

```
VIDEOPORT_API PVOID VideoPortGetRomImage(
  IN PVOID HwDeviceExtension,
  IN PVOID Unused1,
  IN ULONG Unused2,
  IN ULONG Length
);
```

## Parameters

`HwDeviceExtension`

A pointer to the miniport driver's device extension.

`Unused1`

Currently ignored by the video port driver; should be set to <b>NULL</b>.

`Unused2`

Currently ignored by the video port driver; should be set to zero.

`Length`

Either the number of bytes of ROM data that the video port driver should read and return, or zero.


## Return Value

<b>VideoPortGetRomImage</b> returns a pointer to a buffer containing the device's ROM (BIOS) data on success; otherwise, returns <b>NULL</b> to indicate either there was insufficient memory for the operation, or the device's ROM could not be accessed.

## Remarks

<b>VideoPortGetRomImage</b> does not read ROM using the legacy 0xC0000 mapping. It reads ROM that can be discovered using the ACPI_METHOD_DISPLAY_ROM method or the ROM base address register.

The ACPI_METHOD_DISPLAY_ROM alias, defined in Dispmprt.h, represents the method used to obtain the BIOS ROM image. This method is required when the ROM image is stored in a proprietary format such as the system BIOS ROM. This method is not necessary if the ROM image can be read through a standard PCI interface.

The video port driver allocates a buffer of <i>Length</i> bytes and fills it with data read from the device's ROM. The video port driver always reads <i>Length</i> bytes from the beginning of the device's ROM.

If a miniport driver calls <b>VideoPortGetRomImage</b> multiple times, the video port driver will free the buffer from a previous call before allocating and returning a buffer in the current call. Consequently, a miniport driver must only reference the pointer returned by this call to <b>VideoPortGetRomImage</b>.

The miniport driver can free the buffer allocated by the video port driver by calling <b>VideoPortGetRomImage</b> with a <i>Length</i> of zero.
