# VideoPortAllocateCommonBuffer function
The <b>VideoPortAllocateCommonBuffer</b> function allocates and maps system memory so that it is simultaneously accessible from both the processor and a device for common-buffer DMA operations.

## Syntax

````
PVOID VideoPortAllocateCommonBuffer(
  _In_  PVOID             HwDeviceExtension,
  _In_  PVP_DMA_ADAPTER   VpDmaAdapter,
  _In_  ULONG             DesiredLength,
  _Out_ PPHYSICAL_ADDRESS LogicalAddress,
  _In_  BOOLEAN           CacheEnabled,
  _Out_ PVOID             Reserved
);
````

## Parameters

`HwDeviceExtension`

Pointer to the miniport driver's device extension.

`VpDmaAdapter`

Pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff570570">VP_DMA_ADAPTER</a> structure that represents the bus-master adapter. This structure was returned by a previous call to <a href="..\video\nf-video-videoportgetdmaadapter.md">VideoPortGetDmaAdapter</a>.

`DesiredLength`

Specifies the requested number of bytes of memory.

`LogicalAddress`

Pointer to a memory location that receives the logical address to be used by the adapter to access the allocated buffer.

`CacheEnabled`

Specifies whether the allocated memory can be cached.  For more information, see the description of the <i>CacheEnabled</i> parameter for <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pallocate_common_buffer.md">AllocateCommonBuffer</a>.

`Reserved`

Is currently ignored by the video port driver; should be set to <b>NULL</b>.


## Return Value

<b>VideoPortAllocateCommonBuffer</b> returns the base virtual address of the allocated buffer if successful; otherwise, it returns <b>NULL</b> if the buffer cannot be allocated.

## Remarks

When the buffer is no longer needed, the video miniport driver should release it by calling <a href="..\video\nf-video-videoportreleasecommonbuffer.md">VideoPortReleaseCommonBuffer</a>.
