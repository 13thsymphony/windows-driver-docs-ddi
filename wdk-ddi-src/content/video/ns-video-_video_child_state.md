# _VIDEO_CHILD_STATE structure
The VIDEO_CHILD_STATE structure contains information about a child device and the state into which it should be placed.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct _VIDEO_CHILD_STATE {
  ULONG Id;
  ULONG State;
} VIDEO_CHILD_STATE, *PVIDEO_CHILD_STATE;
```

## Members


`Id`

Specifies the ID for a particular child device, as given to it by the miniport driver. This value is the same as that returned in the <i>UId</i> parameter of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/175030c1-95d9-4a3b-976c-16e04852cb91">HwVidGetVideoChildDescriptor</a> function.

`State`

Specifies the new state, on or off, for the child device. A value of one (1) indicates that the child device should be turned on; a value of zero (0) indicates that it should be turned off. One possible use for <b>State</b> is in hotkey switching from one display device to another.

## Remarks
One member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff570501">VIDEO_CHILD_STATE_CONFIGURATION</a> structure is an array of VIDEO_CHILD_STATE structures. Each of these structures maintains state information for one of an adapter's child devices.
