# _VP_DEVICE_DESCRIPTION structure
The VP_DEVICE_DESCRIPTION structure describes the attributes of the physical device for which a driver is requesting a DMA object.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct _VP_DEVICE_DESCRIPTION {
  BOOLEAN ScatterGather;
  BOOLEAN Dma32BitAddresses;
  BOOLEAN Dma64BitAddresses;
  ULONG   MaximumLength;
} VP_DEVICE_DESCRIPTION, *PVP_DEVICE_DESCRIPTION;
```

## Members


`ScatterGather`

If <b>TRUE</b>, indicates that the device supports scatter/gather DMA. If <b>FALSE</b>, the device does not support scatter/gather DMA.

`Dma32BitAddresses`

If <b>TRUE</b>, specifies that 32-bit addresses are being used for DMA operations.

`Dma64BitAddresses`

If <b>TRUE</b>, specifies that 64-bit addresses are being used for DMA operations.

`MaximumLength`

Specifies the maximum number of bytes the device can handle in each DMA operation.

## Remarks
This structure is available in Windows XP and later.
