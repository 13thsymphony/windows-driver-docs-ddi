# _FILTER_VOLUME_STANDARD_INFORMATION structure
The  caller-allocated FILTER_VOLUME_STANDARD_INFORMATION structure contains information for a volume.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _FILTER_VOLUME_STANDARD_INFORMATION {
  ULONG               NextEntryOffset;
  ULONG               Flags;
  ULONG               FrameID;
  FLT_FILESYSTEM_TYPE FileSystemType;
  USHORT              FilterVolumeNameLength;
  WCHAR               FilterVolumeName[1];
} FILTER_VOLUME_STANDARD_INFORMATION, *PFILTER_VOLUME_STANDARD_INFORMATION;
````

## Members


`FileSystemType`

Read-only member used to identify the type of file system being used on the volume.  The possible values for this member are listed in <a href="..\fltuserstructures\ne-fltuserstructures-_flt_filesystem_type.md">FLT_FILESYSTEM_TYPE</a>.

`FilterVolumeName`

Read-only name of the volume of <b>FilterVolumeNameLength</b> length.  This Unicode string is not NULL-terminated.

`FilterVolumeNameLength`

Read-only length, in bytes, of the volume name.

`Flags`

A read-only bitmask of system-defined flags that describe attributes of the volume. The following are valid flag values.
<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
FLTFL_VSI_DETACHED_VOLUME

</td>
<td>
The volume in not currently attached to a storage stack.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`FrameID`

Read-only member used to identify the filter manager frame that the volume is in.

`NextEntryOffset`

Read-only offset, in bytes, of the next FILTER_VOLUME_STANDARD_INFORMATION structure if multiple structures are present in the buffer. This member is zero if no other structures follow this one.

## Remarks
Filter manager enumeration routines, such as <a href="..\fltkernel\nf-fltkernel-fltenumeratevolumeinformation.md">FltEnumerateVolumeInformation</a>, can fill a buffer with structures of type FILTER_VOLUME_STANDARD_INFORMATION where each structure represents a volume known to filter manager.  This list of structures  can contain multiple volumes with the same name.  For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c05982dc-4124-4f9a-93b8-0e56ac296d1b">Understanding Volume Enumerations with Duplicate Volume Names</a>.

The FILTER_VOLUME_STANDARD_INFORMATION structure must be aligned on a LONGLONG (8-byte) boundary. If a buffer contains two or more of these structures, the <b>NextEntryOffset</b> value in each entry falls on an 8-byte boundary.

A FILTER_VOLUME_STANDARD_INFORMATION structure can be allocated from paged or nonpaged pool.

## Requirements
