# _FILTER_VOLUME_BASIC_INFORMATION structure
The caller-allocated FILTER_VOLUME_BASIC_INFORMATION  structure contains basic information for a volume.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _FILTER_VOLUME_BASIC_INFORMATION {
  USHORT FilterVolumeNameLength;
  WCHAR  FilterVolumeName[1];
} FILTER_VOLUME_BASIC_INFORMATION, *PFILTER_VOLUME_BASIC_INFORMATION;
````

## Members


`FilterVolumeName`

Read-only name of the volume of <b>FilterVolumeNameLength</b> length.  This Unicode string is not NULL-terminated.

`FilterVolumeNameLength`

Read-only length, in bytes, of the volume name.

## Remarks
Filter manager enumeration routines, such as <a href="..\fltkernel\nf-fltkernel-fltenumeratevolumeinformation.md">FltEnumerateVolumeInformation</a>, can fill a buffer with structures of type FILTER_VOLUME_BASIC_INFORMATION where each structure represents a volume known to filter manager.  This list of structures can contain multiple volumes with the same name.  For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c05982dc-4124-4f9a-93b8-0e56ac296d1b">Understanding Volume Enumerations with Duplicate Volume Names</a>.

The FILTER_VOLUME_BASIC_INFORMATION structure must be aligned on a LONGLONG (8-byte) boundary. If a buffer contains two or more of these structures, the <b>NextEntryOffset</b> value in each structure falls on an 8-byte boundary.

A FILTER_VOLUME_BASIC_INFORMATION structure can be allocated from paged or nonpaged pool.
