# _FILTER_MESSAGE_HEADER structure
The FILTER_MESSAGE_HEADER structure contains message header information.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _FILTER_MESSAGE_HEADER {
  ULONG     ReplyLength;
  ULONGLONG MessageId;
} FILTER_MESSAGE_HEADER, *PFILTER_MESSAGE_HEADER;
````

## Members


`MessageId`

On output from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540506">FilterGetMessage</a>, this field receives the unique identifier (ID) for the message sent by the kernel-mode driver. If the application replies to the message, it must set this ID in the <b>MessageId</b> field of the FILTER_REPLY_HEADER header in the reply.

`ReplyLength`

On output from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540506">FilterGetMessage</a>, this field receives the length, in bytes, of the expected reply, including the FILTER_REPLY_HEADER header. Set to zero if no reply is expected.

## Remarks
To receive messages from a kernel-mode minifilter, a user-mode application typically defines a custom message structure. This structure typically consists of this header structure, followed by an application-defined structure to hold the actual message data.

## Requirements
