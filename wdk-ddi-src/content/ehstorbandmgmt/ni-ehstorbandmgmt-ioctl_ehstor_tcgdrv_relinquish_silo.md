# IOCTL_EHSTOR_TCGDRV_RELINQUISH_SILO IOCTL
The <b>IOCTL_EHSTOR_TCGDRV_RELINQUISH_SILO</b> request relinquishes control of band management by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) Storage Silo driver.  Applications issue this request to manage a storage silo directly. The band management functionality and API provided by the TCG Storage Silo driver are disabled.

### Major Code
[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](xref:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control")

### Input Buffer
None.

### Input Buffer Length
None.

### Output Buffer
None.

### Output Buffer Length
None.

### Input / Output Buffer

### Status Block
On return, the <b>Status</b> field will contain STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation was successful. Otherwise, another appropriate status code is returned.

## Remarks
When the TCG Storage Silo driver relinquishes control, all band management IOCTLs registered by an <a href="..\ehstorioctl\ni-ehstorioctl-ioctl_ehstor_driver_report_capabilities.md"> IOCTL_EHSTOR_DRIVER_REPORT_CAPABILITIES</a> request are unregistered. Any band management IOCTL requests received are returned with STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_REQUEST. 

After relinquishing control, the TCG Storage Silo driver can regain control of a storage device when the device is stopped and restarted.

To prevent the TCG Storage Silo driver from reconfiguring the TCG subsystem in a mode compatible with Windows after restart, the SID credential should be changed to a nondefault value or SID authority should be disabled. This will also allow direct management of a storage silo.

## Requirements
