# IOCTL_EHSTOR_BANDMGMT_ACTIVATE IOCTL
This <b>IOCTL_EHSTOR_BANDMGMT_ACTIVATE</b> request is sent to activate the security features and band management on a storage device. The request includes activation options and the authentication key.

### Major Code
[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](xref:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control")

### Input Buffer
The input buffer at <b>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> contains an  <b>ACTIVATE_REVERT_PARAMETERS</b>  structure. <b>ACTIVATE_REVERT_PARAMETERS</b> is declared in <i>ehstorbandmgmt.h</i> as the following.



The size of the structure. This is set to <b>sizeof</b>(ACTIVATE_REVERT_PARAMETERS).

A bitmask of activation flags. This is a bitwise OR value of the following.

 

The offset from the beginning of the system buffer to the location of an <b>AUTH_KEY</b> structure.

Following <b>ACTIVATE_REVERT_PARAMETERS</b> in the system buffer is an <b>AUTH_KEY</b> structure. This holds the key data bytes for the authentication key. <b>AUTH_KEY</b> is declared in <i>ehstorbandmgmt.h</i> as the following.



The size of the key, in bytes, of the key data at <b>Key</b>. If <b>KeySize</b> is set to 0, a default key is used.

A variable length byte array that contains the key data.

### Input Buffer Length
The length of an  <b>ACTIVATE_REVERT_PARAMETERS</b>  structure.

### Output Buffer
None.

### Output Buffer Length
None.

### Input / Output Buffer
<text></text>

### Input / Output Buffer Length
<text></text>

### Status Block
I/O Status block
One of the following values can be returned in the <b>Status</b> field.

    ## Remarks
        If STATUS_SUCCESS is returned from this request, a driver or application can then send an <a href="..\ehstorbandmgmt\ni-ehstorbandmgmt-ioctl_ehstor_bandmgmt_query_capabilities.md">IOCTL_EHSTOR_BANDMGMT_QUERY_CAPABILITIES</a> request to retrieve the enabled band management capabilities of the device.

Before a successful return from <b>IOCTL_EHSTOR_BANDMGMT_ACTIVATE</b>, the device is not activated. Until the device is activated, the only band management IOCTL that will   return successfully is <a href="..\ehstorbandmgmt\ni-ehstorbandmgmt-ioctl_ehstor_bandmgmt_query_capabilities.md">IOCTL_EHSTOR_BANDMGMT_QUERY_CAPABILITIES</a>. After activation, the remaining band management IOCTLs are available.

Activation of Enhanced Storage devices is controlled by the Group Policy settings of the system.  The registry value at <i>HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\EnhancedStorageDevices\TCGSecurityActivationDisabled</i> determines whether security activation is 
enabled. A REG_DWORD value of 0 allows security activation on the storage device. Otherwise, a value of 1 disables security activation and the <b>IOCTL_EHSTOR_BANDMGMT_ACTIVATE</b> request will return with <b>STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED.</b>
