# IOCTL_EHSTOR_BANDMGMT_SET_BAND_LOCATION IOCTL



## -description
The location properties of bands in a band-managed storage device are modified with the <b>IOCTL_EHSTOR_BANDMGMT_SET_BAND_LOCATION</b> request.



## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
The buffer at <i>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</i> must contain a   <a href="storage.set_band_location_parameters">SET_BAND_LOCATION_PARAMETERS</a> structure followed by the <b>AUTH_KEY</b> and <a href="storage.band_location_info">BAND_LOCATION_INFO</a> structures. 

If the <b>AuthKeyOffset</b> member of <a href="storage.set_band_location_parameters">SET_BAND_LOCATION_PARAMETERS</a> is set to <b>EHSTOR_BANDMGR_NO_KEY</b>, the input data in the system buffer need not include an <b>AUTH_KEY</b> structure.


### -input-buffer-length
<i>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</i> indicates the size, in bytes, of the buffer, which must be at least <b>sizeof</b> (SET_BAND_LOCATION_PARAMETERS)   + <b>sizeof</b>(AUTH_KEY) + <b>sizeof</b>(BAND_LOCATION_INFO).


### -output-buffer
None.


### -output-buffer-length
None.


### -in-out-buffer

<text></text>

### -inout-buffer-length

<text></text>

### -status-block
I/O Status block
One of the following values can be returned in the <b>Status</b> field.

 


## -remarks
Data in LBAs that remains after resizing is not modified by the operation. Also,  it is unnecessary to unmount a volume during a resize operation if the LBA range that spans the volume remains within the band after  resizing.

The changes made to the band table by this request are committed to the device atomically before the IOCTL request completes. Therefore, it is guaranteed that the band is modified with all of its properties set or no properties set at all should a system or power failure occur.

The <b>BandSize</b> member of <a href="storage.band_location_info">BAND_LOCATION_INFO</a> must be greater than  0. This IOCTL cannot resize a band to 0 to cause a band deletion. To delete a band, the <a href="..\ehstorbandmgmt\ni-ehstorbandmgmt-ioctl_ehstor_bandmgmt_create_band.md">IOCTL_EHSTOR_BANDMGMT_DELETE_BAND</a> request is used.

If <a href="storage.band_location_info">BAND_LOCATION_INFO</a> specifies properties for the global band, <b>BandStart</b> must be set to 0 and <b>BandSize</b> must be set to –1.
