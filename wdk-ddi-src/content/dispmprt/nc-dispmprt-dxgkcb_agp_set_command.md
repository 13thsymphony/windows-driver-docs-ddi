# DXGKCB_AGP_SET_COMMAND callback function
The <b>AgpSetCommand</b> function sets the AGP rate and specifies whether side band addressing and fast write transactions are enabled.

## Syntax

```
DXGKCB_AGP_SET_COMMAND DxgkcbAgpSetCommand;

NTSTATUS DxgkcbAgpSetCommand(
  HANDLE Context,
  ULONG Command
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Context`

A handle to a context block that is associated with an AGP interface. The display miniport driver previously received this handle in the <b>Context</b> member of the DXGK_AGP_INTERFACE structure that was filled in by <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkcb_query_services.md">DxgkCbQueryServices</a>.

`Command`

A set of flags that specify the AGP rate and the types of AGP transactions that will be used.

The caller must set one, and only one, of the following flags.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DXGK_AGPCOMMAND_AGP1X

</td>
<td>
The AGP transfer rate is 1X.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DXGK_AGPCOMMAND_AGP2X

</td>
<td>
The AGP transfer rate is 2X.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DXGK_AGPCOMMAND_AGP4X

</td>
<td>
The AGP transfer rate is 4X.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DXGK_AGPCOMMAND_AGP8X

</td>
<td>
The AGP transfer rate is 8X.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

The caller might also choose to set or clear the following flags.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DXGK_AGPCOMMAND_DISABLE_SBA

</td>
<td>
If this flag is set, side band addressing is disabled. If this flag is cleared, side band addressing is enabled.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DXGK_AGPCOMMAND_DISABLE_FW

</td>
<td>
If this flag is set, fast write transactions are disabled. If this flag is cleared, fast write transactions are enabled. Note that fast write transactions cannot be used with AGP1X.

</td>
</tr>
</table>


## Return Value

<b>AgpSetCommand</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if it succeeds. Otherwise, it returns one of the error codes defined in <i>Ntstatus.h</i>.
