# DXGK_BRIGHTNESS_INTERFACE structure
The <b>DXGK_BRIGHTNESS_INTERFACE</b> structure contains pointers to functions in the Panel Brightness Control Interface, which is implemented by the display miniport driver.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct {
  USHORT                       Size;
  USHORT                       Version;
  PVOID                        Context;
  PINTERFACE_REFERENCE         InterfaceReference;
  PINTERFACE_DEREFERENCE       InterfaceDereference;
  DXGK_BRIGHTNESS_GET_POSSIBLE GetPossibleBrightness;
  DXGK_BRIGHTNESS_SET          SetBrightness;
  DXGK_BRIGHTNESS_GET          GetBrightness;
} DXGK_BRIGHTNESS_INTERFACE, *PDXGK_BRIGHTNESS_INTERFACE;
````

## Members


`Context`

A pointer to a private context block.

`GetBrightness`

A pointer to the display miniport driver's <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgk_brightness_get.md">DxgkDdiGetBrightness</a> function.

`GetPossibleBrightness`

A pointer to the display miniport driver's <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgk_brightness_get_possible.md">DxgkDdiGetPossibleBrightness</a> function.

`InterfaceDereference`

A pointer to an interface dereference function that is implemented by the display miniport driver.

`InterfaceReference`

A pointer to an interface reference function that is implemented by the display miniport driver.

`SetBrightness`

A pointer to the display miniport driver's <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgk_brightness_set.md">DxgkDdiSetBrightness</a> function.

`Size`

The size, in bytes, of this structure.

`Version`

The version number of the brightness interface. Version number constants are defined in Dispmprt.h (for example, <b>DXGK_BRIGHTNESS_INTERFACE_VERSION_1</b>).

## Remarks
A kernel-mode component that must use the brightness interface initiates a call to the display miniport driver's <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_query_interface.md">DxgkDdiQueryInterface</a> function to retrieve the interface and passes GUID_DEVINTERFACE_BRIGHTNESS in the <b>InterfaceType</b> member of the <a href="..\video\ns-video-_query_interface.md">QUERY_INTERFACE</a> structure that the <i>QueryInterface</i> parameter points to.

## Requirements
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows Driver kit version** |  |
| **Minimum KMDF version** |  |
| **Minimum UMDF version** |  |
| **Header** | dispmprt.h (include Dispmprt.h) |
