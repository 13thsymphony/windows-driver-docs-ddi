# _DXGK_GENERIC_DESCRIPTOR structure
The DXGK_GENERIC_DESCRIPTOR structure contains descriptive information about a child device of the display adapter.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DXGK_GENERIC_DESCRIPTOR {
  WCHAR HardwareId[DXGK_MAX_REG_SZ_LEN];
  WCHAR InstanceId[DXGK_MAX_REG_SZ_LEN];
  WCHAR CompatibleId[DXGK_MAX_REG_SZ_LEN];
  WCHAR DeviceText[DXGK_MAX_REG_SZ_LEN];
} DXGK_GENERIC_DESCRIPTOR, *PDXGK_GENERIC_DESCRIPTOR;
````

## Members


`HardwareId`

A single wide-character string, terminated by two wide NULL characters, that holds the hardware ID of the child device.

`InstanceId`

A single wide-character string, terminated by two wide NULL characters, that holds the instance ID of the child device.

`CompatibleId`

A sequence of wide-character strings, each of which is terminated by a single wide NULL character. The last string in the sequence is terminated by two wide NULL characters.

`DeviceText`

A single wide-character string, terminated by two wide NULL characters, that holds the device text of the child device.

## Remarks
The display adapter has two types of child devices: <b>TypeVideoOutput</b> and <b>TypeOther</b>. For child devices of type <b>TypeOther</b>, the display port driver passes a DXGK_GENERIC_DESCRIPTOR structure to the display miniport driver's <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_query_device_descriptor.md">DxgkDdiQueryDeviceDescriptor</a> function. <i>DxgkDdiQueryDeviceDescriptor</i> must fill in the members of the structure.

## Requirements
