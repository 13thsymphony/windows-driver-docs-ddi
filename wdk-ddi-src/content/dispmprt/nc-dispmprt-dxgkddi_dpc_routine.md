# DXGKDDI_DPC_ROUTINE callback function
The <i>DxgkDdiDpcRoutine</i> function is called back at IRQL DISPATCH_LEVEL after the display miniport driver calls <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkcb_queue_dpc.md">DxgkCbQueueDpc</a>.

## Syntax

```
DXGKDDI_DPC_ROUTINE DxgkddiDpcRoutine;

void DxgkddiDpcRoutine(
  IN_CONST_PVOID MiniportDeviceContext
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`MiniportDeviceContext`

A handle to a context block that is associated with a display adapter. The display miniport driver's <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_add_device.md">DxgkDdiAddDevice</a> function previously provided this handle to the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

Only one deferred procedure call (DPC) can be scheduled (at a given time) for a given display adapter.

If the display miniport driver is supporting several display adapters, the <i>DxgkDdiDpcRoutine</i> might be called in a reentrant fashion. That is, while <i>DxgkDdiDpcRoutine</i> is executing on one processor on behalf of a particular display adapter, it could be called again on another processor on behalf of a different display adapter.
