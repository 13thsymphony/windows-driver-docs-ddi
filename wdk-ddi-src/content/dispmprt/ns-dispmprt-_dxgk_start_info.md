# _DXGK_START_INFO structure
The DXGK_START_INFO structure holds information that is needed by the display miniport driver's <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_start_device.md">DxgkDdiStartDevice</a> function.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DXGK_START_INFO {
  ULONG RequiredDmaQueueEntry;
  GUID  AdapterGuid;
#if (DXGKDDI_INTERFACE_VERSION >= DXGKDDI_INTERFACE_VERSION_WIN8)
  LUID  AdapterLuid;
#endif 
} DXGK_START_INFO, *PDXGK_START_INFO;
````

## Members


`AdapterGuid`

A GUID that will serve as an identifier for the adapter being started.

`AdapterLuid`

Available starting with Windows 8.

A locally unique identifier (LUID) that will serve as an identifier for the adapter being started.

`RequiredDmaQueueEntry`

The number of DMA buffers that the display miniport driver (or the display adapter) must be able to hold in a queue. The display miniport driver must preallocate all resources required to accommodate this number of DMA buffers.

## Remarks
The DirectX graphics kernel subsystem submits DMA buffers to the display miniport driver by calling <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_submitcommand.md">DxgkDdiSubmitCommand</a>.

The <i>DxgkStartInfo</i> parameter of the <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_start_device.md">DxgkDdiStartDevice</a> function is a pointer to a DXGK_START_INFO structure.
