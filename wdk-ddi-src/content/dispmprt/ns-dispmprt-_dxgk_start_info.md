# _DXGK_START_INFO structure
The DXGK_START_INFO structure holds information that is needed by the display miniport driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ffacbb39-2581-4207-841d-28ce57fbc64d">DxgkDdiStartDevice</a> function.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct _DXGK_START_INFO {
  ULONG RequiredDmaQueueEntry;
  GUID  AdapterGuid;
  LUID  AdapterLuid;
} *PDXGK_START_INFO, DXGK_START_INFO;
```

## Members


`RequiredDmaQueueEntry`

The number of DMA buffers that the display miniport driver (or the display adapter) must be able to hold in a queue. The display miniport driver must preallocate all resources required to accommodate this number of DMA buffers.

`AdapterGuid`

A GUID that will serve as an identifier for the adapter being started.

`AdapterLuid`

Available starting with WindowsÂ 8.

A locally unique identifier (LUID) that will serve as an identifier for the adapter being started.

## Remarks
The DirectX graphics kernel subsystem submits DMA buffers to the display miniport driver by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/de1925ab-e444-4cf6-acd9-8fdab26afcec">DxgkDdiSubmitCommand</a>.

The <i>DxgkStartInfo</i> parameter of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ffacbb39-2581-4207-841d-28ce57fbc64d">DxgkDdiStartDevice</a> function is a pointer to a DXGK_START_INFO structure.
