# DXGKDDI_SYSTEM_DISPLAY_ENABLE callback



## -description
Called by the operating system to request the display miniport driver to reset the current  display device to a specified state.

Starting with Windows 8, the operating system calls this function during a bugcheck operation following a system stop error.



## -prototype

````
DXGKDDI_SYSTEM_DISPLAY_ENABLE DxgkDdiSystemDisplayEnable;

_Check_return_ NTSTATUS* DxgkDdiSystemDisplayEnable(
  _In_  PVOID                                MiniportDeviceContext,
  _In_  D3DDDI_VIDEO_PRESENT_TARGET_ID       TargetId,
  _In_  PDXGKARG_SYSTEM_DISPLAY_ENABLE_FLAGS Flags,
  _Out_ UINT                                 *Width,
  _Out_ UINT                                 *Height,
  _Out_ D3DDDIFORMAT                         *ColorFormat
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param MiniportDeviceContext [in]

A handle to a context block that is associated with a display adapter. The display miniport driver's <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_add_device.md">DxgkDdiAddDevice</a> function previously provided this handle to the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem.




### -param TargetId [in]

A D3DDDI_VIDEO_PRESENT_TARGET_ID value that specifies the identifier of the video present target on the display adapter that the display device is connected to. This identifier could be for the target that was left in the current video present network (VidPn) state during the previous call to <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_commitvidpn.md">DxgkDdiCommitVidPn</a>.

For more details about the use of the <i>TargetId</i> parameter, see the following "Video present target initialization" section.


### -param Flags [in]

A pointer to a value that contains a bitwise OR of flags. This member is reserved by the operating system.


### -param Width [out]

A UINT value that specifies the width of the display mode of the specified device in units of pixels.


### -param Height [out]

A UINT value that specifies the height of the display mode  of the specified device in units of pixels.


### -param ColorFormat [out]

A pointer to a <a href="display.d3dddiformat">D3DDDIFORMAT</a> value that specifies the color format of the display device.


## -returns
<i>DxgkDdiSystemDisplayEnable</i> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if it succeeds. If the target specified by the TargetId parameter is not connected to a display device, the function returns STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED. Otherwise, it returns one of the error codes defined in Ntstatus.h.


## -remarks
The display miniport driver must follow these steps when its <i>DxgkDdiSystemDisplayEnable</i> function is called:

If the driver cannot maintain the current display mode, or if the target is not part of the active topology, the driver should attempt to set a frame buffer on another target that is capable of a display resolution of at least 640 x 480 pixels in a format of 24 bits per pixel. If that is not possible, the driver can fail this function call, which will result in a system bugcheck and the display of a black screen.

It is not required that the driver use a linear frame buffer mode. However, the driver should support write operations to this frame buffer from sources that have the  <b>D3DDDIFMT_A8R8G8B8</b> format of the <a href="display.d3dddiformat">D3DDDIFORMAT</a> enumeration.

After the driver gives the operating system control over display  functionality, the operating system can call the <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_system_display_write.md">DxgkDdiSystemDisplayWrite</a> function to update the screen image and to write a block of images from specified sources to the screen that was reset by the <i>DxgkDdiSystemDisplayEnable</i> function.


<a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_system_display_write.md">DxgkDdiSystemDisplayWrite</a> provides the driver with the starting address of the source image as well as the stride, width, and height. The color format of the source image is always <b>D3DDDIFMT_X8R8G8B8</b>. The operating system guarantees that the source image is in non-paged memory.

The  driver must write this source image to the current screen starting at the positions specified by the <i>PositionX</i> and <i>PositionY</i> parameters of the <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_system_display_write.md">DxgkDdiSystemDisplayWrite</a> function.

It is recommended that the driver use the CPU to write the image from the source to the frame buffer because a system bugcheck might be caused by repeated <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f410eec7-026f-41e0-8c60-72f651659ead">Timeout Detection and Recovery (TDR)</a> instances that result in the GPU being in an unknown condition.

Windows kernel-mode functions might not be available while this function is being called.

<i>DxgkDdiSystemDisplayEnable</i> can be called at any IRQL, so it must be in nonpageable memory. <i>DxgkDdiSystemDisplayEnable</i> must not call any code that is in pageable memory and must not manipulate any data that is in pageable memory.
