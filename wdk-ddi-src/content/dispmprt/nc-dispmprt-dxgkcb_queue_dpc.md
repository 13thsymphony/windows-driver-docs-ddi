# DXGKCB_QUEUE_DPC callback



## -description
The <b>DxgkCbQueueDpc</b> function queues a deferred procedure call (DPC) for execution at IRQL  DISPATCH_LEVEL.


## -prototype

````
DXGKCB_QUEUE_DPC DxgkCbQueueDpc;

BOOLEAN DxgkCbQueueDpc(
  _In_ HANDLE DeviceHandle
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param DeviceHandle [in]

A handle that represents a display adapter. The display miniport driver previously obtained this handle in the <b>DeviceHandle</b> member of the <a href="display.dxgkrnl_interface">DXGKRNL_INTERFACE</a> structure that was passed to <a href="display.dxgkddistartdevice">DxgkDdiStartDevice</a>.

## -returns
<b>DxgkCbQueueDpc</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the DPC is successfully queued; otherwise it returns <b>FALSE</b>.

## -remarks
This function queues a DPC object for the display miniport and calls the <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_dpc_routine.md">DxgkDdiDpcRoutine</a> function when the interrupt service routine (ISR) requests it. 

There can only be one callback to this function scheduled per device at any one time. If a callback is already scheduled for a device, a second call to <b>DxgkCbQueueDpc</b> will not have any effect and will return <b>FALSE</b>.
