# DXGKCB_QUEUE_DPC callback function
The <b>DxgkCbQueueDpc</b> function queues a deferred procedure call (DPC) for execution at IRQL  DISPATCH_LEVEL.

## Syntax

```
DXGKCB_QUEUE_DPC DxgkcbQueueDpc;

BOOLEAN DxgkcbQueueDpc(
  HANDLE DeviceHandle
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`DeviceHandle`

A handle that represents a display adapter. The display miniport driver previously obtained this handle in the <b>DeviceHandle</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560942">DXGKRNL_INTERFACE</a> structure that was passed to <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_start_device.md">DxgkDdiStartDevice</a>.


## Return Value

<b>DxgkCbQueueDpc</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the DPC is successfully queued; otherwise it returns <b>FALSE</b>.

## Remarks

This function queues a DPC object for the display miniport and calls the <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_dpc_routine.md">DxgkDdiDpcRoutine</a> function when the interrupt service routine (ISR) requests it. 

There can only be one callback to this function scheduled per device at any one time. If a callback is already scheduled for a device, a second call to <b>DxgkCbQueueDpc</b> will not have any effect and will return <b>FALSE</b>.
