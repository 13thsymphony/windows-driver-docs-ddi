# DXGKDDI_PROTECTED_CALLBACK callback function
The <i>DxgkProtectedCallback</i> callback routine is implemented by the display miniport driver and is called by <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkcb_exclude_adapter_access.md">DxgkCbExcludeAdapterAccess</a> during a protected state when all access to the display adapter is prevented.

## Syntax

```
DXGKDDI_PROTECTED_CALLBACK DxgkddiProtectedCallback;

void DxgkddiProtectedCallback(
  CONST PVOID,
  PVOID ProtectedCallbackContext,
  NTSTATUS ProtectionStatus
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`PVOID`



`ProtectedCallbackContext`

A pointer to driver-defined information that was specified in a previous call to <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkcb_exclude_adapter_access.md">DxgkCbExcludeAdapterAccess</a>.

`ProtectionStatus`

Status of the display adapter's protected state. If STATUS_SUCCESS, the adapter was successfully protected from access. A failure status code indicates that the adapter is not protected.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

<i>DxgkProtectedCallback</i> must be called only when all access to the display adapter has been halted, as indicated by the status parameter <i>ProtectionStatus.</i>

The driver must ensure that following conditions are met during the callback routine:
<ul>
<li>
All interrupts on the device are disabled, and any remaining pending interrupts are handled, including any DPCs that may have been queued on any CPU but not yet serviced.

</li>
<li>
All write-combined memory and any other cache-related states have been flushed.

</li>
<li>
Any ACPI or BIOS/SMI events that occur do not access the hardware.

</li>
<li>
Coherency is achieved between all adapters in a linked-adapter state configuration.

</li>
<li>
The adapter, including its registers and display mode, is maintained in the proper state to handle the DMA buffer that occurs on the return from the <i>DxgkProtectedCallback</i> routine. The driver should not change the visible state or capabilities of any application.

</li>
</ul>
