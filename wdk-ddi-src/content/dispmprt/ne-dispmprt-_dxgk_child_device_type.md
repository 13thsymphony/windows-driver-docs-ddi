# _DXGK_CHILD_DEVICE_TYPE Enumeration
The DXGK_CHILD_DEVICE_TYPE enumeration is used to indicate the type of a child device of the display adapter.

## Syntax
````
typedef enum _DXGK_CHILD_DEVICE_TYPE { 
  TypeUninitialized,
  TypeVideoOutput,
  TypeOther,
  TypeIntegratedDisplay
} DXGK_CHILD_DEVICE_TYPE, *PDXGK_CHILD_DEVICE_TYPE;
````

## Constants

<table>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>TypeIntegratedDisplay</td>
                    <td>Type indicating that this target is permanently connected to an integrated display.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>TypeOther</td>
                    <td>Indicates that the child device is not a video output. TV tuners, crossbar switches, and MPEG2 codecs are examples of child devices that are not video outputs.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>TypeUninitialized</td>
                    <td>Indicates that a variable of type DXGK_CHILD_DEVICE_TYPE has not yet been assigned a meaningful value.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>TypeVideoOutput</td>
                    <td>Indicates that the child device is a video output. A video output is the circuitry on the display adapter that supplies a video signal to an external or integrated monitor (or other display device). Note that monitors, integrated LCD panels, and other devices that actually display an image are not considered child devices of the display adapter.</td>
                </tr>
</table>

    ## Remarks

        The <b>ChildDeviceType</b> member of a <a href="..\dispmprt\ns-dispmprt-_dxgk_child_descriptor.md">DXGK_CHILD_DESCRIPTOR</a> structure is a DXGK_CHILD_DEVICE_TYPE value.
