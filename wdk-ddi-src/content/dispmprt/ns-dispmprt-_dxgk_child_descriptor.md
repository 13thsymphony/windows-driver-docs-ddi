# _DXGK_CHILD_DESCRIPTOR structure
The DXGK_CHILD_DESCRIPTOR structure holds identification and capability information for an individual child device of the display adapter.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DXGK_CHILD_DESCRIPTOR {
  DXGK_CHILD_DEVICE_TYPE  ChildDeviceType;
  DXGK_CHILD_CAPABILITIES ChildCapabilities;
  ULONG                   AcpiUid;
  ULONG                   ChildUid;
} DXGK_CHILD_DESCRIPTOR, *PDXGK_CHILD_DESCRIPTOR;
````

## Members


`AcpiUid`

If the child device is an ACPI device, this member contains the unique ACPI identifier of the child device.

`ChildCapabilities`

A <a href="..\dispmprt\ns-dispmprt-_dxgk_child_capabilities.md">DXGK_CHILD_CAPABILITIES</a> structure that describes the capabilities of the child device.

`ChildDeviceType`

A member of the <a href="..\dispmprt\ne-dispmprt-_dxgk_child_device_type.md">DXGK_CHILD_DEVICE_TYPE</a> enumeration that indicates the type of the child device.

`ChildUid`

A unique identifier, created by the display miniport driver, that identifies the child device.

## Remarks
The <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_query_child_relations.md">DxgkDdiQueryChildRelations</a> function, implemented by the display miniport driver, fills in an array of DXGK_CHILD_DESCRIPTOR structures, one for each child device of the display adapter.

Each child device of type <b>TypeVideoOutput</b> is associated with a video present target, and the <b>ChildUid</b> member of this structure is used as the identifier for that video present target. Several functions implemented by the video present network (VidPN) manager receive a video present target identifier. For an example, see the <i>VidPnTargetId</i> parameter of the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_vidpn_acquiretargetmodeset.md">pfnAcquireTargetModeSet</a> function.

## Requirements

| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows version** | Available in Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating systems. Available in Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating systems. |
