# DXGK_BRIGHTNESS_GET_POSSIBLE callback function
The <i>DxgkDdiGetPossibleBrightness</i> function retrieves the brightness levels that an integrated display panel supports.

## Syntax

```
DXGK_BRIGHTNESS_GET_POSSIBLE DxgkBrightnessGetPossible;

NTSTATUS DxgkBrightnessGetPossible(
  PVOID Context,
  ULONG BufferSize,
  PUCHAR LevelCount,
  PUCHAR BrightnessLevels
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Context`

[in] A handle to a context block that is associated with a display adapter. The display miniport driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5fd4046f-54c3-4dfc-8d51-0d9ebcde0bea">DxgkDdiAddDevice</a> function previously provided this handle to the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem.

`BufferSize`

[in] The size, in bytes, of the buffer that is passed in the <i>BrightnessLevels</i> parameter.

`LevelCount`

[out] A pointer to a variable that receives the number of brightness levels that the driver returns in the buffer that the <i>BrightnessLevels</i> parameter points to.

`BrightnessLevels`

[in/out] A pointer to a buffer that receives the brightness levels that an integrated display panel supports.


## Return Value

<i>DxgkDdiGetPossibleBrightness</i> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if it succeeds. Otherwise, it returns one of the error codes that are defined in <i>Ntstatus.h</i>.

## Remarks

The display miniport driver should return brightness levels in the buffer that the <i>BrightnessLevels</i> parameter points to in the following order:

<ul>
<li>
The first brightness level value is the brightness level that the BIOS uses when the computer runs on AC power. 

</li>
<li>
The second brightness level value is the brightness level that the BIOS uses when the computer runs on DC power. 

</li>
<li>
The remaining brightness level values are hardware-supported brightness levels. 

</li>
</ul>
To simplify your job of implementing a display miniport driver, the operating system provides the driver with the buffer that the <i>BrightnessLevels</i> parameter points to.

<i>DxgkDdiGetPossibleBrightness</i> should be made pageable.
