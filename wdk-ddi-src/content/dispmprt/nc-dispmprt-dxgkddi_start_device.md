# DXGKDDI_START_DEVICE function
The <i>DxgkDdiStartDevice</i> function prepares a display adapter to receive I/O requests.

## Syntax

```
DXGKDDI_START_DEVICE DxgkddiStartDevice;

NTSTATUS DxgkddiStartDevice(
  IN_CONST_PVOID MiniportDeviceContext,
  IN_PDXGK_START_INFO DxgkStartInfo,
  IN_PDXGKRNL_INTERFACE DxgkInterface,
  OUT_PULONG NumberOfVideoPresentSources,
  OUT_PULONG NumberOfChildren
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`MiniportDeviceContext`

A handle to a context block associated with a display adapter. The display miniport driver's <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_add_device.md">DxgkDdiAddDevice</a> function previously provided this handle to the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem.

`DxgkStartInfo`

A pointer to a <a href="..\dispmprt\ns-dispmprt-_dxgk_start_info.md">DXGK_START_INFO</a> structure that contains information that the display miniport driver needs for initialization.

`DxgkInterface`

A pointer to a <a href="..\dispmprt\ns-dispmprt-_dxgkrnl_interface.md">DXGKRNL_INTERFACE</a> structure that contains pointers to functions, implemented by the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem, that the display miniport driver can call.

`NumberOfVideoPresentSources`

A pointer to a <b>ULONG</b> variable that receives the number of video present sources supported by the display adapter. For more information about video present sources, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/27687fa4-1266-4341-b68a-83374c24ef73">Multiple Monitors and Video Present Networks</a>.

`NumberOfChildren`

A pointer to a <b>ULONG</b> variable that receives the total number of devices that are children of the display adapter represented by <i>MiniportDeviceContext</i>. This count must include potential child devices as well as child devices that are currently present. For example, if docking a portable computer will make additional video outputs available, those video outputs must be counted regardless of whether the portable computer is currently docked. For more information about child devices, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9fd20e1a-db98-4571-8fc4-6d33fd0e2f16">Child Devices of the Display Adapter</a>.


## Return Value

<i>DxgkDdiStartDevice</i> returns <b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b> if it succeeds; otherwise, it returns one of the error codes defined in <i>Ntstatus.h</i>.

## Remarks

The <i>DxgkDdiStartDevice</i> function must perform the following actions:
<ul>
<li>
Save the function pointers supplied by the <a href="..\dispmprt\ns-dispmprt-_dxgkrnl_interface.md">DXGKRNL_INTERFACE</a> structure passed to the <i>DxgkInterface</i> parameter. Also save the <b>DeviceHandle</b> member of the <b>DXGKRNL_INTERFACE</b> structure; you will need that handle to call back into the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem.

</li>
<li>
Allocate a <a href="..\dispmprt\ns-dispmprt-_dxgk_device_info.md">DXGK_DEVICE_INFO</a> structure, and call <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkcb_get_device_information.md">DxgkCbGetDeviceInformation</a> to fill in the members of that structure, which include the registry path, the PDO, and a list of translated resources for the display adapter represented by <i>MiniportDeviceContext</i>. Save selected members (ones that the display miniport driver will need later) of the <b>DXGK_DEVICE_INFO</b> structure in the context block represented by <i>MiniportDeviceContext.</i>

</li>
<li>
Map memory resources into system space by calling the <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkcb_map_memory.md">DxgkCbMapMemory</a> function.

</li>
<li>
Initialize the context block represented by <i>MiniportDeviceContext</i> with any state that is required to prepare the hardware to receive I/O requests.

</li>
<li>
Set <i>NumberOfVideoPresentSources </i> to the number of video present sources supported by the display adapter that is represented by <i>MiniportDeviceContext</i>.

</li>
<li>
Set <i>NumberOfChildren </i> to the number of devices that are (or could become) children of the display adapter represented by <i>MiniportDeviceContext</i>.

</li>
<li>
Enable interrupts for the display adapter represented by <i>MiniportDeviceContext</i>.

</li>
</ul>Starting with Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) 1.2, the display miniport driver calls   the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6454adb3-c958-467b-acbc-b8937b98cd57">DxgkCbAcquirePostDisplayOwnership</a> function to obtain the information about the display mode that had been previously set by the firmware and system loader. If <b>DxgkCbAcquirePostDisplayOwnership</b> returns with <b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b>, the driver determines whether it has to reinitialize the display based on the display mode information that was returned through the <i>DisplayInfo</i> parameter. Otherwise,  the driver should not assume that any specific display mode is currently enabled on the device, and it should initialize the display.

The <i>DxgkDdiStartDevice</i> function should be made pageable.
