# DXGKCB_MIRACAST_SEND_MESSAGE_CALLBACK callback



## -description
Called in kernel mode when the message that was sent to the user-mode  driver with a call to the <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkcb_miracast_send_message.md">DxgkCbMiracastSendMessage</a> function has completed or has been canceled.



## -prototype

````
DXGKCB_MIRACAST_SEND_MESSAGE_CALLBACK DxgkCbMiracastSendMessageCallback;

VOID* DxgkCbMiracastSendMessageCallback(
  _In_ PVOID            CallbackContext,
  _In_ PIO_STATUS_BLOCK pIoStatusBlock
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param CallbackContext [in]

A pointer to the driver-supplied callback context. The operating system passes this context to the driver-supplied callback routine after the operation has completed.


### -param pIoStatusBlock [in]

A pointer to a driver-supplied buffer to hold the returned <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_io_status_block.md">IO_STATUS_BLOCK</a> structure for the completed or canceled user-mode message. This structure holds the status of the I/O call and the number of bytes that the user-mode driver wrote to the output buffer.


## -returns
This callback function does not return a value.


## -remarks
This function can be called simultaneously from multiple execution threads.

The operating system guarantees that this function follows the zero level synchronization mode as defined in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2baf91e8-fafb-40e2-a24c-cbf04fe45274">Threading and Synchronization Zero Level</a>.
