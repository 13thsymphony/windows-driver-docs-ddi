# DXGK_BRIGHTNESS_INTERFACE_2 structure
Contains pointers to functions in the Panel Brightness Control Interface Version 2. Used by Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) 1.2 and later display miniport drivers that support adaptive and smooth brightness control.

````

## Members


`Context`

[in] A pointer to a private context block.

`GetBacklightReduction`

[out] A pointer to the display miniport driver's  <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgk_brightness_get_backlight_reduction.md">DxgkDdiGetBacklightReduction</a> function. This function is available starting with Windows 8.

`GetBrightness`

[out] A pointer to the display miniport driver's <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgk_brightness_get.md">DxgkDdiGetBrightness</a> function.

`GetBrightnessCaps`

[out] A pointer to the display miniport driver's <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgk_brightness_get_caps.md">DxgkDdiGetBrightnessCaps</a> function. This function is available starting with Windows 8.

`GetPossibleBrightness`

[out] A pointer to the display miniport driver's <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgk_brightness_get_possible.md">DxgkDdiGetPossibleBrightness</a> function.

`InterfaceDereference`

[out] A pointer to an interface dereference function that is implemented by the display miniport driver.

`InterfaceReference`

[out] A pointer to an interface reference function that is implemented by the display miniport driver.

`SetBacklightOptimization`

[out] A pointer to the display miniport driver's  <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgk_brightness_set_backlight_optimization.md">DxgkDdiSetBacklightOptimization</a> function. This function is available starting with Windows 8.

`SetBrightness`

[out] A pointer to the display miniport driver's <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgk_brightness_set.md">DxgkDdiSetBrightness</a> function.

`SetBrightnessState`

[out] A pointer to the display miniport driver's  <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgk_brightness_set_state.md">DxgkDdiSetBrightnessState</a> function. This function is available starting with Windows 8.

`Size`

[in] The size, in bytes, of this structure.

`Version`

[in] The version number of the brightness interface. Version number constants are defined in Dispmprt.h (for example, <b>DXGK_BRIGHTNESS_INTERFACE_VERSION_2</b>).

## Remarks
This structure provides additional members, beyond those in the <a href="..\dispmprt\ns-dispmprt-dxgk_brightness_interface.md">DXGK_BRIGHTNESS_INTERFACE</a> interface, that point to driver-implemented functions that control, measure, and optimize display panel brightness and allow smooth brightness control.

For more information on this interface, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj647485">Brightness Control Interface V. 2 (Adaptive and Smooth Brightness Control)</a>.
