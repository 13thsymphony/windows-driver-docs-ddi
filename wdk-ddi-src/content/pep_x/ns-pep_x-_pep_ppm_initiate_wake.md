# _PEP_PPM_INITIATE_WAKE structure
The <b>PEP_PPM_INITIATE_WAKE</b> structure indicates whether a processor requires an interrupt to wake up from an idle state.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PEP_PPM_INITIATE_WAKE {
  BOOLEAN NeedInterruptForCompletion;
} PEP_PPM_INITIATE_WAKE, *PPEP_PPM_INITIATE_WAKE;
````

## Members


`NeedInterruptForCompletion`

[out] Whether the processor requires an interrupt finish waking up from an idle state. Set to <b>TRUE</b> if the processor requires an interrupt, or to <b>FALSE</b> if it does not.

## Remarks
This structure is used by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186809">PEP_NOTIFY_PPM_INITIATE_WAKE</a> notification. The <b>NeedInterruptForCompletion</b> member contains an output value that the platform extension plug-in (PEP) writes to the structure in response to this notification.

If the PEP sets the <b>NeedInterruptForCompletion</b> member to T<b></b>RUE, the PEP must ensure that the processor is enabled to be interrupted before the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt186627">AcceptProcessorNotification</a> callback routine returns.

The PEP should set the <b>NeedInterruptForCompletion</b> member to <b>FALSE</b> if the processor is already running and/or will eventually exit the idle state (and is in the process of doing so) without requiring a software-generated interrupt.

## Requirements

| **Windows version** | Supported starting with Windows 10. Supported starting with Windows 10. |
