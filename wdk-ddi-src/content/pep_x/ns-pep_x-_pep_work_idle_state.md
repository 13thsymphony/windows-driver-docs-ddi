# _PEP_WORK_IDLE_STATE structure
The <b>PEP_WORK_IDLE_STATE</b> structure contains a request to transition a component to an F<i>x</i> power state.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PEP_WORK_IDLE_STATE {
  POHANDLE DeviceHandle;
  ULONG    Component;
  ULONG    State;
} PEP_WORK_IDLE_STATE, *PPEP_WORK_IDLE_STATE;
````

## Members


`Component`

[in] The index that identifies the component. This member is an index into the <b>Components</b> array in the <a href="..\pepfx\ns-pepfx-_pep_device_register_v2.md">PEP_DEVICE_REGISTER_V2</a> structure that the PEP previously supplied in response to the <b>PEP_DPM_REGISTER_DEVICE</b> notification for this device. If the <b>Components</b> array contains N elements, component indexes range from 0 to N–1.

`DeviceHandle`

A handle that represents the registration of the device with the Windows <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9F2D8ACD-44D5-46E0-9FC7-1B38B99450FF">power management framework</a> (PoFx). A POHANDLE value that represents the registration of the device with PoFx. The platform extension plug-in (PEP) previously received this handle from PoFx during the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186849">PEP_DPM_REGISTER_DEVICE</a> notification that informed the PEP that the device's driver stack registered the device with PoFx.

`State`

The target F<i>x</i> power state to transition the component to. If this parameter is 0, the target state is F0; if this parameter is 1, the target state is F1; and so on. For more information about F<i>x</i> power states, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh450935">Component-Level Power Management</a>.

## Remarks
The <b>IdleState</b> member of the <a href="..\pepfx\ns-pepfx-_pep_work_information.md">PEP_WORK_INFORMATION</a> structure is a <b>PEP_WORK_IDLE_STATE</b> structure.
