# _PEP_PPM_QUERY_PLATFORM_STATE structure
The <b>PEP_PPM_QUERY_PLATFORM_STATE</b> structure contains information about a platform idle state.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PEP_PPM_QUERY_PLATFORM_STATE {
  ULONG                   StateIndex;
  PEP_PLATFORM_IDLE_STATE State;
} PEP_PPM_QUERY_PLATFORM_STATE, *PPEP_PPM_QUERY_PLATFORM_STATE;
````

## Members


`State`

[out] A <a href="..\pepfx\ns-pepfx-_pep_platform_idle_state.md">PEP_PLATFORM_IDLE_STATE</a> structure that describes the platform idle state.

`StateIndex`

[in] The index of this platform idle state. If the hardware platform supports N platform idle states, the states are numbered 0 to N-1. The Windows <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/B08F8ABF-FD43-434C-A345-337FBB799D9B">power management framework</a> (PoFx) previously sent a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186827">PEP_NOTIFY_PPM_QUERY_PLATFORM_STATES</a> notification to the platform extension plug-in (PEP) to determine the number of supported platform idle states.

## Remarks
This structure is used by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186826">PEP_NOTIFY_PPM_QUERY_PLATFORM_STATE</a> notification. The <b>StateIndex</b> member of the <b>PEP_PPM_QUERY_PLATFORM_STATE</b> structure contains an input value that is supplied by the Windows <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/B08F8ABF-FD43-434C-A345-337FBB799D9B">power management framework</a> (PoFx) when this notification is sent to the PEP. The <b>State</b> member contains an output value that the PEP writes to the structure in response to the notification.

The buffer that PoFx allocates to hold the <b>PEP_PPM_QUERY_PLATFORM_STATE</b> structure is guaranteed to be large enough to contain this structure plus any elements of the <b>State.DependencyArray</b> array that follow this structure.

## Requirements

| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows version** | Supported starting with Windows 10. Supported starting with Windows 10. |
| **Header** | pep_x.h (include Pep_x.h) |
