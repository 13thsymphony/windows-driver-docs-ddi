# _PEP_WORK structure
The <b>PEP_WORK</b> structure indicates whether the PEP has a work request to submit to the Windows <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9F2D8ACD-44D5-46E0-9FC7-1B38B99450FF">power management framework</a> (PoFx).

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PEP_WORK {
  PPEP_WORK_INFORMATION WorkInformation;
  BOOLEAN               NeedWork;
} PEP_WORK, *PPEP_WORK;
````

## Members


`NeedWork`

[out] Whether the PEP has a work request to submit. Set this member to TRUE if the PEP has a work request, or to FALSE if the PEP has no work to request.

`WorkInformation`

[out] A pointer to a PEP-allocated <a href="..\pepfx\ns-pepfx-_pep_work_information.md">PEP_WORK_INFORMATION</a> structure that describes the work that the PEP is requesting. If <b>NeedWork</b> is TRUE, <b>WorkInformation</b> must point to a valid <b>PEP_WORK_INFORMATION</b> structure. If <b>NeedWork</b> is FALSE, <b>WorkInformation</b> must be NULL.

## Remarks
This structure is used by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/using-peps-for-acpi-services">PEP_DPM_WORK</a> notification. Both members of the structure contain values that the PEP writes to the structure in response to this notification.
