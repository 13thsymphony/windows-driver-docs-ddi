# _PEP_COMPONENT_ACTIVE structure
The <b>PEP_COMPONENT_ACTIVE</b> structure identifies a component that is making a transition between the idle condition and the active condition.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PEP_COMPONENT_ACTIVE {
  PEPHANDLE             DeviceHandle;
  ULONG                 Component;
  BOOLEAN               Active;
  PPEP_WORK_INFORMATION WorkInformation;
  BOOLEAN               NeedWork;
} PEP_COMPONENT_ACTIVE, *PPEP_COMPONENT_ACTIVE;
````

## Members


`Active`

[in] Whether the component is making a transition to the active condition. If TRUE, the component is making a transition from the idle condition to the active condition. If FALSE, the component is making a transition from the active condition to the idle condition.

`Component`

[in] The index that identifies the component. This member is an index into the <b>Components</b> array in the <a href="..\pepfx\ns-pepfx-_pep_device_register_v2.md">PEP_DEVICE_REGISTER_V2</a> structure that the PEP previously supplied in response to the <b>PEP_DPM_REGISTER_DEVICE</b> notification for this device. If the <b>Components</b> array contains N elements, component indexes range from 0 to N–1.

`DeviceHandle`

[in] A PEPHANDLE value that identifies the device. The PEP supplied this handle in response to a previous <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186849">PEP_DPM_REGISTER_DEVICE</a> notification.

`NeedWork`

[out] Whether the PEP has a work request to submit in response to this notification. Set to TRUE if the PEP has work to request, or to FALSE if the PEP has no work to request.

`WorkInformation`

[out] A pointer to a <a href="..\pepfx\ns-pepfx-_pep_work_information.md">PEP_WORK_INFORMATION</a> structure that describes the work that the PEP requests in response to this notification. If <b>NeedWork</b> is TRUE, <b>WorkInformation</b> must point to a valid <b>PEP_WORK_INFORMATION</b> structure. If <b>NeedWork</b> is FALSE, <b>WorkInformation</b> must be NULL.

## Remarks
This structure is used by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt629112">PEP_DPM_COMPONENT_ACTIVE</a> notification. The first three members of the structure contain input values that are supplied by the Windows <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/B08F8ABF-FD43-434C-A345-337FBB799D9B">power management framework</a> (PoFx). The last two members contain output values that the PEP writes to the structure in response to this notification.

## Requirements
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows version** | Supported starting with Windows 10. Supported starting with Windows 10. |
| **Header** | pep_x.h (include Pepfx.h) |
