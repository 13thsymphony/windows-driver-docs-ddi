# POFXCALLBACKREQUESTWORKER callback function
The <b>RequestWorker</b> routine is called by a platform extension plug-in (PEP) to inform the Windows <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/B08F8ABF-FD43-434C-A345-337FBB799D9B">power management framework</a> (PoFx) that the platform extension plug-in (PEP) has a work request to submit on behalf of the specified device.

## Syntax

```
POFXCALLBACKREQUESTWORKER Pofxcallbackrequestworker;

void Pofxcallbackrequestworker(
  POHANDLE PluginHandle
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`PluginHandle`

A POHANDLE value that represents the registration of the device with PoFx. The PEP previously received this handle from PoFx during the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186849">PEP_DPM_REGISTER_DEVICE</a> notification that informed the PEP that the device's driver stack registered the device with PoFx.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

This routine is implemented by PoFx and is called by the PEP. The <b>RequestWorker</b> member of the <a href="..\pepfx\ns-pepfx-_pep_kernel_information_struct_v3.md">PEP_KERNEL_INFORMATION_STRUCT_V3</a> structure is a pointer to a <b>RequestWorker</b> routine.

Each time the PEP calls this routine, PoFx responds by sending a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/using-peps-for-acpi-services">PEP_DPM_WORK</a> notification to the PEP. This notification might be delayed if a worker thread is not immediately available to process the work request.

A PEP can call this routine at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL.
