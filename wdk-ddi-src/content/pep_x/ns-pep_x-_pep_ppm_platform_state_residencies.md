# _PEP_PPM_PLATFORM_STATE_RESIDENCIES structure
The <b>PEP_PPM_PLATFORM_STATE_RESIDENCIES</b> structure contains the accumulated residency times and transition counts for the idle states that are supported by the hardware platform.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PEP_PPM_PLATFORM_STATE_RESIDENCIES {
  ULONG                             Count;
  PPEP_PPM_PLATFORM_STATE_RESIDENCY States;
} PEP_PPM_PLATFORM_STATE_RESIDENCIES, *PPEP_PPM_PLATFORM_STATE_RESIDENCIES;
````

## Members


`Count`

[in] The number of elements in the array pointed to by the <b>States</b> member. The number of array elements equals the number of platform idle states that the PEP previously provided in response to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186827">PEP_NOTIFY_PPM_QUERY_PLATFORM_STATES</a> notification.

`States`

[in] A pointer to an output buffer to which the PEP writes an array of <a href="..\pepfx\ns-pepfx-_pep_ppm_platform_state_residency.md">PEP_PPM_PLATFORM_STATE_RESIDENCY</a> structures. Each structure contains the accumulated residency and transition count information for a particular platform idle state. This buffer is guaranteed to be large enough to contain the number of array elements specified by the <b>Count</b> member. Each idle state is identified by its array index. If the array contains N elements, idle state indexes range from 0 to N-1.

## Remarks
This structure is used by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186817">PEP_NOTIFY_PPM_QUERY_PLATFORM_STATE_RESIDENCIES</a> notification. Both members of the structure contain input values that the Windows <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/B08F8ABF-FD43-434C-A345-337FBB799D9B">power management framework</a> (PoFx) supplies when this notification is sent to the PEP. PoFx allocates the output buffer pointed to by the <b>States</b> member, and the PEP writes to this buffer.
