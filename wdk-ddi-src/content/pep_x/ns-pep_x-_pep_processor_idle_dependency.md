# _PEP_PROCESSOR_IDLE_DEPENDENCY structure
The <b>PEP_PROCESSOR_IDLE_DEPENDENCY</b> structure specifies the dependencies of a platform idle state on the specified processor.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PEP_PROCESSOR_IDLE_DEPENDENCY {
  POHANDLE TargetProcessor;
  UCHAR    ExpectedState;
  BOOLEAN  AllowDeeperStates;
  BOOLEAN  LooseDependency;
} PEP_PROCESSOR_IDLE_DEPENDENCY, *PPEP_PROCESSOR_IDLE_DEPENDENCY;
````

## Members


`AllowDeeperStates`

Whether a secondary (subordinate) processor can be in a deeper processor idle state than <b>ExpectedState</b> and still satisfy the constraints of the transition to the platform idle state. Set this member to <b>TRUE</b> if a secondary processor in a deeper idle state can still satisfy the constraints, and to <b>FALSE</b> if it cannot. A primary processor (identified by the <b>TargetProcessor</b> member) can enter the selected idle state only after its secondary processors have entered their corresponding idle states.

`ExpectedState`

The index of the processor idle state that this processor must enter to initiate the platform's transition to this platform idle state. If the <b>IdleStates</b> array in the <a href="..\pepfx\ns-pepfx-_pep_ppm_query_idle_states_v2.md">PEP_PPM_QUERY_IDLE_STATES_V2</a> structure contains N elements, the idle states are numbered 0 to N-1 in the order in which they appear in the array.

`LooseDependency`

Whether the platform idle state has a loose dependency on the idle state of this processor. Set this member to <b>TRUE</b> to indicate a loose dependency in which a best effort to synchronize the idle state transitions of the platform and processor is sufficient. Set to <b>FALSE</b> to indicate a dependency in which the operating system is required to strictly synchronize these transitions. If <b>LooseDependency</b> is <b>FALSE</b>, the <b>WakesSpuriously</b> bit in the <a href="..\pepfx\ns-pepfx-_pep_processor_idle_state_v2.md">PEP_PROCESSOR_IDLE_STATE_V2</a> structure for this processor must be <b>FALSE</b>.

`TargetProcessor`

A <b>POHANDLE</b> value that identifies the processor. The platform extension plug-in (PEP) received this handle in a previous <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186849">PEP_DPM_REGISTER_DEVICE</a> notification.

## Remarks
The <b>DependencyArray</b> member of the <a href="..\pep_x\ns-pep_x-_pep_ppm_idle_select.md">PEP_PPM_IDLE_SELECT</a> structure is a pointer to an array of <b>PEP_PROCESSOR_IDLE_DEPENDENCY</b> structures. The <b>DependencyArray</b> member of the <a href="..\pepfx\ns-pepfx-_pep_platform_idle_state.md">PEP_PLATFORM_IDLE_STATE</a> structure is the first element in an array of <b>PEP_PROCESSOR_IDLE_DEPENDENCY</b> structures.
