# PFND3DDDI_PRESENT callback



## -description
<p>The <i>Present</i> function notifies the user-mode display driver that an application finished rendering and requests that the driver display the source surface by either copying or flipping or that the driver perform a color-fill operation. </p>


## -prototype

````
PFND3DDDI_PRESENT Present;

__checkReturn HRESULT APIENTRY Present(
  _In_       HANDLE            hDevice,
  _In_ const D3DDDIARG_PRESENT *pData
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters
<dl>

### -param <i>hDevice</i> [in]

<dd>
<p> A handle to the display device (graphics context).</p>
</dd>

### -param <i>pData</i> [in]

<dd>
<p> A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543240">D3DDDIARG_PRESENT</a> structure that describes the resource to display.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

## -returns
<p><i>Present</i> returns one of the following values:</p><dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl><p>The resource is successfully displayed.</p><dl>
<dt><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b></dt>
</dl><p><i>Present</i> could not allocate the required memory for it to complete.</p>

<p> </p>

## -remarks
<p>The Microsoft Direct3D runtime calls the user-mode display driver's <i>Present</i> function to notify the user-mode display driver that an application finished rendering and to request that the driver display out the source surface or that the driver perform a color-fill operation. If the <b>hSrcResource</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543240">D3DDDIARG_PRESENT</a> structure that the <i>pData</i> parameter points to is non-<b>NULL</b>, <i>Present</i> requests that the user-mode display driver display new content to the screen; if <b>hSrcResource</b> is <b>NULL</b>, <i>Present</i> requests that the user-mode display driver perform a color-fill operation to the screen. </p>

<p>If the <b>hDstResource</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543240">D3DDDIARG_PRESENT</a> structure is <b>NULL</b>, the destination surface is unknown. In addition, the destination surface and a list of clipping rectangles are determined in kernel mode before sending the hardware command stream through DMA to the graphics processor. </p>

<p>As a result, the user-mode display driver cannot generate hardware instructions to perform the present operation. These hardware instructions must be generated by the display miniport driver. However, when the <b>hSrcResource</b> member of D3DDDIARG_PRESENT is non-<b>NULL</b>, the user-mode display driver must derive the allocation handle to the source surface and insert this handle in the <b>hSrcAllocation</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544218">D3DDDICB_PRESENT</a> structure in a call to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/460b9be5-5817-4225-9089-f86ad64f4554">pfnPresentCb</a> function. The display miniport driver can then successfully generate the hardware instructions. The user-mode display driver typically derives the allocation handle from the resource information in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543240">D3DDDIARG_PRESENT</a> structure.</p>

<p>If the <b>hDstResource</b> member of D3DDDIARG_PRESENT is non-<b>NULL</b>, the destination surface for the present is known and the user-mode display driver must fill in the <b>hDstAllocation</b> member of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544218">D3DDDICB_PRESENT</a> with the corresponding allocation handle.</p>

<p>If a user-mode display driver exposes a DDI version of less than 0x0000000C (the driver returns this value in the <b>DriverVersion</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541724">D3D10DDIARG_OPENADAPTER</a> structure in a call to the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/41dc9ee4-e9bc-4ebd-9b90-6446ded6ea16">OpenAdapter</a> function), the Direct3D runtime first calls the user-mode display driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh463886">Flush</a> function to submit any outstanding hardware commands in the command buffer before the runtime calls the user-mode display driver's <i>Present</i> function. In this way, the user-mode display driver's <i>Present</i> function is serialized with render operations (that is, calls to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f242162e-6237-469c-b178-5a51dcf69e32">pfnRenderCb</a> function). If a user-mode display driver exposes a DDI version of 0x0000000C or greater and the calling application runs in windowed mode, the runtime also calls <i>Flush</i> before it calls <i>Present</i>. If a user-mode display driver exposes a DDI version of 0x0000000C or greater and the calling application runs in full-screen mode, the runtime will not call <i>Flush</i> before it calls <i>Present</i>. This behavior allows drivers that implement their own threading to queue present calls. A driver that exposes a DDI version of 0x0000000C or greater must call <b>pfnRenderCb</b> to internally flush any outstanding command buffers before the driver calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/460b9be5-5817-4225-9089-f86ad64f4554">pfnPresentCb</a> function.</p>
