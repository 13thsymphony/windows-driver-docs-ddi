# PFND3DDDI_CHECKDIRECTFLIPSUPPORT callback



## -description
<p>Called by the Desktop Window Manager (DWM) to verify that the user-mode driver supports Direct Flip operations, in which video memory is seamlessly flipped between an application's managed primary allocations and the DWM's managed primary allocations.</p>


## -prototype

````
PFND3DDDI_CHECKDIRECTFLIPSUPPORT CheckDirectFlipSupport;

__checkReturn HRESULT APIENTRY* CheckDirectFlipSupport(
  _In_          HANDLE                           hDevice,
  _Inout_ const D3DDDIARG_CHECKDIRECTFLIPSUPPORT *pData
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters
<dl>

### -param <i>hDevice</i> [in]

<dd>
<p> A handle to the display device (graphics context).</p>
</dd>

### -param <i>pData</i> [in, out]

<dd>
<p> A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451072">D3DDDIARG_CHECKDIRECTFLIPSUPPORT</a> structure that defines the parameters for the operation.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

## -returns
<p>
      Returns S_OK or an appropriate error result if the operation is not successfully performed.</p>

## -remarks
<p>This function is called at least once before the DWM attempts to present to a Direct Flip swapchain. It is also called after each mode change occurs, or after the DWM re-creates its own swapchain for any reason.</p>

<p>The user-mode driver should ensure that the managed primary allocations of the application and the DWM have the following compatible resources:</p>

<p>The user-mode driver might need to call the kernel-mode driver to perform these validations. To do this, call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/66c0347f-2cf3-42fc-8641-47c731e958c9">pfnEscapeCb</a> callback function and then call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/144429e5-34e6-4416-980e-2838e8f9e415">DxgkCbGetHandleData</a> function to access the kernel-mode driver's resource allocation data.</p>

<p>Because the DWM typically creates its own device using the highest possible Microsoft Direct3D feature level, the DWM will not call this function if the hardware supports a Direct3D device driver interface (DDI) that is greater than version 9.3. However, any Microsoft Direct3D 9 driver should implement this function to enable the Direct Flip user experience.</p>
