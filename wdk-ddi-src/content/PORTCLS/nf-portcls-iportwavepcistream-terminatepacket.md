# IPortWavePciStream::TerminatePacket method



## -description
<p>The <code>TerminatePacket</code> method terminates the packet currently being mapped.</p>


## -syntax

````
NTSTATUS TerminatePacket(
  Â  None
);
````


## -parameters
<dl>

### -param <i>None</i> 

<dd></dd>
</dl>

## -returns
<p><code>TerminatePacket</code> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call was successful. Otherwise, the method returns an appropriate error code.</p>

## -remarks
<p>This method is used primarily for capture situations in which I/O packets need to end at specific points in the stream (for example, to synchronize with video frames). The data buffer for a capture pin on an audio device consists of one or more I/O packets. Each I/O packet is the portion of the data buffer that is attached to a particular mapping IRP. By default, while a capture stream is in the KSSTATE_RUN state, the contents of an I/O packet become available to the client only when the last mapping in the packet has been filled. The <code>TerminatePacket</code> method makes a partially filled packet immediately available to the client without waiting for additional capture data.</p>

<p>Changing the state of a capture stream from KSSTATE_RUN to KSSTATE_STOP automatically terminates the current I/O packet.</p>
