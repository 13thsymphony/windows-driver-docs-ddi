# PAGP_COMMIT_PHYSICAL callback function
The <b>AgpCommitPhysical</b> function maps system (physical) memory to the specified range of AGP-decodable physical addresses.

## Syntax

```
PAGP_COMMIT_PHYSICAL PagpCommitPhysical;

BOOLEAN PagpCommitPhysical(
  IN PVOID HwDeviceExtension,
  IN PVOID PhysicalReserveContext,
  IN ULONG Pages,
  IN ULONG Offset
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`HwDeviceExtension`

Pointer to the device extension of the miniport driver.

`PhysicalReserveContext`

Identifies a reserved physical address range. The context handle is obtained from <a href="..\videoagp\nc-videoagp-pagp_reserve_physical.md">AgpReservePhysical</a>.

`Pages`

Specifies the number of pages of system memory to commit.

`Offset`

Specifies the page offset at which to commit the pages. The offset is applied to the reserved physical address range associated with <b>PhysicalReserveContext</b>.


## Return Value

<b>AgpCommitPhysical</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the mapping was successful, and <b>FALSE</b> otherwise.

## Remarks

A video miniport driver must first reserve physical addresses by calling <a href="..\videoagp\nc-videoagp-pagp_reserve_physical.md">AgpReservePhysical</a> before it calls this function.

Do not call <b>AgpCommitPhysical</b> to commit addresses that have already been committed. If the range of pages that is specified by <b>PhysicalReserveContext</b>, <b>Pages</b>, and <b>Offset</b> includes any pages that were previously committed, <b>AgpCommitPhysical</b> might fail.

Video miniport drivers that run on Microsoft Windows 2000 should always reserve and commit a physical range whose size is a multiple of 64 kilobytes. Reserving or committing a physical range that is not a multiple of 64 kilobytes can result in <a href="..\videoagp\nc-videoagp-pagp_reserve_virtual.md">AgpReserveVirtual</a> or <a href="..\videoagp\nc-videoagp-pagp_commit_virtual.md">AgpCommitVirtual</a> returning an invalid virtual address.

On Windows XP and later, <b>AgpCommitPhysical</b> automatically expands the committed range so that it is a multiple of 64 kilobytes.

When a video miniport driver calls <b>AgpCommitPhysical</b>, a portion of the physical address range identified by <b>PhysicalReserveContext</b> is mapped to locked pages of physical memory. The mapped portion begins <b>Offset</b> pages into the range identified by <b>PhysicalReserveContext</b>. The video miniport driver can access committed physical memory as if it were contiguous.
