# PAGP_RESERVE_VIRTUAL callback function
The <b>AgpReserveVirtual</b> function reserves a range of virtual addresses for AGP.

## Syntax

```
PAGP_RESERVE_VIRTUAL PagpReserveVirtual;

PVOID PagpReserveVirtual(
  IN PVOID HwDeviceExtension,
  IN HANDLE ProcessHandle,
  IN PVOID PhysicalReserveContext,
  OUT PVOID *VirtualReserveContext
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`HwDeviceExtension`

Pointer to the miniport driver's device extension.

`ProcessHandle`

Handle of the process in which to reserve the virtual address range. If <b>ProcessHandle</b> is 0, then the virtual address range is allocated in system space.

`PhysicalReserveContext`

Is the context handle that identifies the reserved physical address range with which to associate the virtual memory reservation. This context was obtained from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b3e21c94-acd5-4767-8ba5-70b2dcfb2aaa">AgpReservePhysical</a>.

`*VirtualReserveContext`

Is the location in which the video port driver writes a context handle that identifies the reserved virtual memory.


## Return Value

<b>AgpReserveVirtual</b> returns the base address of the reserved virtual address range if successful; otherwise, returns <b>NULL</b>.

## Remarks

If <b>ProcessHandle</b> is not 0, then <b>AgpReserveVirtual</b> reserves, but does not commit, a range of virtual addresses in the address space of a user-mode process. In that case, you must call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/8a3e7fcd-d838-47ad-a42b-7eb070f81418">AgpCommitVirtual</a> to map the reserved (user-mode) virtual addresses to physical addresses.

If <b>ProcessHandle</b> is 0, then <b>AgpReserveVirtual</b> allocates a range of virtual addresses in system space and automatically maps (commits) the entire range of virtual addresses to physical addresses. Even though <b>AgpReserveVirtual</b> commits the entire virtual range, you still must call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/8a3e7fcd-d838-47ad-a42b-7eb070f81418">AgpCommitVirtual</a> before any code accesses the virtual range.

When you call <b>AgpReserveVirtual</b> to allocate a range of virtual addresses in system space (that is, if you set <b>ProcessHandle</b> to 0), the entire range of physical addresses identified by <b>PhysicalReserveContext</b> must be committed to locked pages of physical memory by a previous call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3c3a6936-7435-4a42-99e6-2c048613af23">AgpCommitPhysical</a>.

The miniport driver can call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4e880b39-e0ee-4801-86b7-ffc06ed415ab">AgpReleaseVirtual</a> several times to reserve many smaller address ranges rather than one big range.

The miniport driver should call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4e880b39-e0ee-4801-86b7-ffc06ed415ab">AgpReleaseVirtual</a> to release the reserved virtual address range when it is no longer needed.
