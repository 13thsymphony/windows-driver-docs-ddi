# PAGP_RESERVE_PHYSICAL callback function
The <b>AgpReservePhysical</b> function reserves a range of physical addresses on the system bus to which the AGP controller can respond.

## Syntax

```
PAGP_RESERVE_PHYSICAL PagpReservePhysical;

PHYSICAL_ADDRESS PagpReservePhysical(
  IN PVOID HwDeviceExtension,
  IN ULONG Pages,
  IN VIDEO_PORT_CACHE_TYPE Caching,
  OUT PVOID *PhysicalReserveContext
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`HwDeviceExtension`

Pointer to the miniport driver's device extension.

`Pages`

Specifies the number of pages that the video port driver should reserve.

`Caching`

Specifies the type of caching that the system should use. This parameter can be set to one of the following values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<b>VpNonCached</b>

</td>
<td>
The system should not cache the range of addresses.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<b>VpWriteCombined</b>

</td>
<td>
The system should use write-combined (WC) caching. For information about WC caching, see the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn642116">Write-Combining Memory in Video Miniport Drivers</a> website article.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<b>VpCached</b>

</td>
<td>
The system should use ordinary caching.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`*PhysicalReserveContext`

Specifies the location in which the video port driver writes a context handle that identifies the reserved physical address space.


## Return Value

<b>AgpReservePhysical</b> returns the base address of the reserved physical address range if successful; otherwise, it returns <b>NULL</b>.

## Remarks

Video miniport drivers that run on Microsoft Windows 2000 should always reserve a range whose size is a multiple of 64 kilobytes. Reserving a range that is not a multiple of 64 kilobytes can result in <a href="..\videoagp\nc-videoagp-pagp_reserve_virtual.md">AgpReserveVirtual</a> or <a href="..\videoagp\nc-videoagp-pagp_commit_virtual.md">AgpCommitVirtual</a> returning an invalid virtual address.

On Microsoft Windows XP and later, <b>AgpReservePhysical</b> automatically expands the requested range to a multiple of 64 kilobytes.

Upon successful return, the AGP controller can respond to the reserved physical address range on the bus. However, the video miniport driver must first call <a href="..\videoagp\nc-videoagp-pagp_commit_physical.md">AgpCommitPhysical</a> to cause this memory to be committed before accessing it in order for the accessed results to be defined.

The miniport driver can call <b>AgpReservePhysical</b> several times to reserve many smaller address ranges rather than one big range.

The miniport driver should call <a href="..\videoagp\nc-videoagp-pagp_release_physical.md">AgpReleasePhysical</a> to release the physical address range when it is no longer needed.
