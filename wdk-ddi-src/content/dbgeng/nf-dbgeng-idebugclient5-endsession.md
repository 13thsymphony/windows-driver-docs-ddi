# IDebugClient5::EndSession method



## -description
The <b>EndSession</b> method ends the current debugger session.



## -syntax

````
HRESULT EndSession(
  [in] ULONG Flags
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Flags [in]

Specifies how to end the session.  <i>Flags</i> can be one of the following values:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DEBUG_END_PASSIVE

</td>
<td>
Perform cleanup for the session.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DEBUG_END_ACTIVE_TERMINATE

</td>
<td>
Attempt to terminate all user-mode targets before performing cleanup for the session.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DEBUG_END_ACTIVE_DETACH

</td>
<td>
Attempt to disconnect from all targets before performing cleanup for the session.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DEBUG_END_REENTRANT

</td>
<td>
Perform only the cleanup that doesn't require acquiring locks.  See Remarks section for details.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DEBUG_END_DISCONNECT

</td>
<td>
Do not end the session.  Disconnect the client from the session and disable the client.

This flag is intended for when remote clients disconnect.  It generates a server message about the disconnection.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


## -returns
This method may also return error values.  See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/713f3ee2-2f5b-415e-9908-90f5ae428b43">Return Values</a> for more details.
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The method was successful.

 


## -remarks
This method may be called at any time with <i>Flags</i> set to DEBUG_END_REENTRANT.  If, for example, the application needs to exit but another thread is using the engine, this method can be used to perform as much cleanup as possible.

Using DEBUG_END_REENTRANT may leave the engine in an indeterminate state. If this flag is used, no subsequent calls should be made to the engine.
