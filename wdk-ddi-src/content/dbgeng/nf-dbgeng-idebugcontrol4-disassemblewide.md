# DisassembleWide method
The <b>DisassembleWide</b>  method disassembles a processor instruction in the target's memory.

## Syntax

````
HRESULT DisassembleWide(
  [in]            ULONG64  Offset,
  [in]            ULONG    Flags,
  [out, optional] PWSTR    Buffer,
  [in]            ULONG    BufferSize,
  [out, optional] PULONG   DisassemblySize,
  [out]           PULONG64 EndOffset
);
````

## Parameters

`Offset`

Specifies the location in the target's memory of the instruction to disassemble.

`Flags`

Specifies the bit-flags that affect the behavior of this method.  Currently the only flag that can be set is DEBUG_DISASM_EFFECTIVE_ADDRESS; when set, the engine will compute the effective address from the current register information and display it.

`Buffer`

Receives the disassembled instruction.  If <i>Buffer</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.

`BufferSize`

Specifies the size, in characters, of the <i>Buffer</i> buffer.

`DisassemblySize`

Receives the size, in characters, of the disassembled instruction.  If <i>DisassemblySize</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.

`EndOffset`

Receives the location in the target's memory of the instruction following the disassembled instruction.


## Return Value

This method can also return error values.  See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/713f3ee2-2f5b-415e-9908-90f5ae428b43">Return Values</a> for more details.

</td>
<td width="60%">
The method was successful.  However, <i>Buffer</i> was too small to hold the disassembled instruction and the instruction was truncated to fit.

## Remarks

The assembly language depends on the effective processor type of the target system.  For information about the assembly language, see the processor documentation.

The disassembly options--returned by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545605">GetAssemblyOptions</a>--affect the operation of this method.
