# GetSourceFileInformationWide method
The <b>GetSourceFileInformationWide</b> method returns specified information about a source file.

## Syntax

````
HRESULT GetSourceFileInformationWide(
  [in]            ULONG   Which,
  [in]            PWSTR   SourceFile,
  [in]            ULONG64 Arg64,
  [in]            ULONG   Arg32,
  [out, optional] PVOID   Buffer,
  [in]            ULONG   BufferSize,
  [out, optional] PULONG  InfoSize
);
````

## Parameters

`Which`

Specifies the piece of information to return.  The <i>Which</i> parameter can take one of the values in the following table.




#### DEBUG_SRCFILE_SYMBOL_TOKEN

Returns a token representing the specified source file on a source server.  This token can be passed to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545430">FindSourceFileAndToken</a> to retrieve information about the file. The token is returned to the <i>Buffer</i> buffer as an array of bytes.  The size of this token is a reflection of the size of the SrcSrv token. 


#### DEBUG_SRCFILE_SYMBOL_TOKEN_SOURCE_COMMAND_WIDE

Queries a source server for the command to extract the source file from source control.  This includes the name of the executable file and its command-line parameters. The command is returned to the <i>Buffer</i> buffer as a Unicode string.

`SourceFile`

Specifies the source file whose information is being requested.  The source file is looked up on all the source servers in the source path.

`Arg64`

Specifies a 64-bit argument.  The value of <i>Which</i> specifies the module whose symbol token is requested.  Regardless of the value of <i>Which</i>, <i>Arg64</i> is a location within the memory allocation of the module.

`Arg32`

Specifies a 32-bit argument.  This parameter is currently unused.

`Buffer`

Receives the requested symbol information.  The type of the data returned depends on the value of <i>Which</i>.  If <i>Buffer</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.

`BufferSize`

Specifies the size in bytes of the <i>Buffer</i> buffer. If <i>Buffer</i> is <b>NULL</b>, <i>BufferSize</i> must also be <b>NULL</b>.

`InfoSize`

Specifies the size in bytes of the information returned to the <i>Buffer</i> buffer. This parameter can be NULL if the data is not required.


## Return Value

This method may also return error values.  See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/713f3ee2-2f5b-415e-9908-90f5ae428b43">Return Values</a> for more details.
