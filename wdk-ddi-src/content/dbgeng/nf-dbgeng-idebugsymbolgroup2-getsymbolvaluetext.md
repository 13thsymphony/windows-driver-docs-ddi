# IDebugSymbolGroup2::GetSymbolValueText method



## -description
The <b>GetSymbolValueText</b>  method returns a string that represents the value of a symbol.



## -syntax

````
HRESULT GetSymbolValueText(
  [in]            ULONG  Index,
  [out, optional] PSTR   Buffer,
  [in]            ULONG  BufferSize,
  [out, optional] PULONG NameSize
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Index [in]

The index of the symbol whose value you want.  The index of a symbol is an identification number. The index ranges from zero through the number of symbols in the symbol group minus one.


### -param Buffer [out, optional]

The value of the symbol as a string.  If <i>Buffer</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.


### -param BufferSize [in]

The size, in characters, of the <i>Buffer </i>buffer.


### -param NameSize [out, optional]

The size, in characters, of the value of the symbol.  If <i>NameSize</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.


## -returns
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The method was successful.
<dl>
<dt><b>S_FALSE</b></dt>
</dl>The method was successful.  However, the value of the symbol would not fit in the buffer referred to by the <i>Buffer</i> parameter, so a truncated value was returned.

 

This method can also return error values.  For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/713f3ee2-2f5b-415e-9908-90f5ae428b43">Return Values</a>.


## -remarks
If you added the symbol to the symbol group by using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537925">AddSymbol</a> method, the string that is returned to <i>Buffer</i> is the name of the symbol that is passed to <b>AddSymbol</b>.

For more information about symbol groups, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554702">Scopes and Symbol Groups</a>.
