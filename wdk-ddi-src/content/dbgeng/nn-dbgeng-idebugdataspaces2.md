## -inheritance
The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IDebugDataSpaces2</b> interface inherits from <a href="..\dbgeng\nn-dbgeng-idebugdataspaces.md">IDebugDataSpaces</a>. <b>IDebugDataSpaces2</b> also has these types of members:

The <b>IDebugDataSpaces2</b> interface has these methods.

Writes a pattern of bytes to the target's physical memory. The pattern is written repeatedly until the specified memory range is filled.

Writes a pattern of bytes to the target's virtual memory. The pattern is written repeatedly until the specified memory range is filled.

 Returns the physical addresses of the system paging structures at different levels of the paging hierarchy.

Provides information about the specified pages in the target's virtual address space.

Retrieves information about a system object specified by a system handle.


Translates a location in the target's virtual address space into a physical memory address.
