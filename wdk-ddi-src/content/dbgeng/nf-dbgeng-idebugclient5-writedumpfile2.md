# WriteDumpFile2 method
The <b>WriteDumpFile2</b> method creates a user-mode or kernel-modecrash dump file.

## Syntax

````
HRESULT WriteDumpFile2(
  [in]           PCSTR DumpFile,
  [in]           ULONG Qualifier,
  [in]           ULONG FormatFlags,
  [in, optional] PCSTR Comment
);
````

## Parameters

`DumpFile`

Specifies the name of the dump file to create.  <i>DumpFile</i> must include the file name extension.  <i>DumpFile</i> can include a relative or absolute path; relative paths are relative to the directory in which the debugger was started.

`Qualifier`

Specifies the type of dump file to create.  For possible values, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541472">DEBUG_DUMP_XXX</a>.

`FormatFlags`

Specifies flags that determine the format of the dump file and--for user-mode minidumps--what information to include in the file.  For details, see Remarks.

`Comment`

Specifies a comment string to be included in the crash dump file.  This string is displayed in the debugger console when the dump file is loaded.  Some dump file formats do not support the storing of comment strings.


## Return Value

This method may also return error values.  See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/713f3ee2-2f5b-415e-9908-90f5ae428b43">Return Values</a> for more details.
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The method was successful.

## Remarks

The DEBUG_FORMAT_<i>XXX</i> bit-flags are used by <b>WriteDumpFile2</b> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561389">WriteDumpFileWide</a> to determine the format of a crash dump file and, for user-mode Minidumps, what information to include in the file.

The following bit-flags apply to all crash dump files.

DEBUG_FORMAT_WRITE_CAB

Package the crash dump file in a CAB file.  The supplied file name or file handle is used for the CAB file; the crash dump is first created in a temporary file before being moved into the CAB file.

DEBUG_FORMAT_CAB_SECONDARY_FILES


<dl>
<dt>Include the current symbols and mapped images in the CAB file.</dt>
<dt>If DEBUG_FORMAT_WRITE_CAB is not set, this flag is ignored.</dt>
</dl>


DEBUG_FORMAT_NO_OVERWRITE

Do not overwrite existing files.

The following bit-flags can also be included for user-mode Minidumps.

DEBUG_FORMAT_USER_SMALL_FULL_MEMORY

Add full memory data.  All accessible committed pages owned by the target application will be included.

DEBUG_FORMAT_USER_SMALL_HANDLE_DATA

Add data about the handles that are associated with the target application.

DEBUG_FORMAT_USER_SMALL_UNLOADED_MODULES

Add unloaded module information.  This information is available only in Windows Server 2003 and later versions of Windows.

DEBUG_FORMAT_USER_SMALL_INDIRECT_MEMORY

Add indirect memory.  A small region of memory that surrounds any address that is referenced by a pointer on the stack or backing store is included.

DEBUG_FORMAT_USER_SMALL_DATA_SEGMENTS

Add all data segments within the executable images.

DEBUG_FORMAT_USER_SMALL_FILTER_MEMORY

Set to zero all of the memory on the stack and in the backing store that is not useful for recreating the stack trace.  This can make compression of the Minidump more efficient and increase privacy by removing unnecessary information.

DEBUG_FORMAT_USER_SMALL_FILTER_PATHS

Remove the module paths, leaving only the module names.  This is useful for protecting privacy by hiding the directory structure (which may contain the user's name).

DEBUG_FORMAT_USER_SMALL_PROCESS_THREAD_DATA

Add the process environment block (PEB) and thread environment block (TEB).  This flag can be used to provide Windows system information for threads and processes.

DEBUG_FORMAT_USER_SMALL_PRIVATE_READ_WRITE_MEMORY

Add all committed private read-write memory pages.

DEBUG_FORMAT_USER_SMALL_NO_OPTIONAL_DATA


<dl>
<dt>Prevent privacy-sensitive data from being included in the Minidump.  Currently, this flag excludes from the Minidump data that would have been added due to the following flags being set:</dt>
<dt>DEBUG_FORMAT_USER_SMALL_PROCESS_THREAD_DATA,</dt>
<dt>DEBUG_FORMAT_USER_SMALL_FULL_MEMORY,</dt>
<dt>DEBUG_FORMAT_USER_SMALL_INDIRECT_MEMORY,</dt>
<dt>DEBUG_FORMAT_USER_SMALL_PRIVATE_READ_WRITE_MEMORY.</dt>
</dl>


DEBUG_FORMAT_USER_SMALL_FULL_MEMORY_INFO

Add all basic memory information.  This is the information returned by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553502">QueryVirtual</a> method.  The information for all memory is included, not just valid memory, which allows the debugger to reconstruct the complete virtual memory layout from the Minidump.

DEBUG_FORMAT_USER_SMALL_THREAD_INFO

Add additional thread information, which includes execution time, start time, exit time, start address, and exit status.

DEBUG_FORMAT_USER_SMALL_CODE_SEGMENTS

Add all code segments with the executable images.
