# IDebugRegisters2::GetInstructionOffset2 method



## -description
The <b>GetInstructionOffset2</b> method returns the location of the current thread's current instruction.



## -syntax

````
HRESULT GetInstructionOffset2(
  [in]  ULONG    Source,
  [out] PULONG64 Offset
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Source [in]

Specifies the register source to query.

The possible values are listed in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Register source</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DEBUG_REGSRC_DEBUGGEE

</td>
<td>
Fetch register information from the target.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DEBUG_REGSRC_EXPLICIT

</td>
<td>
Fetch register information from the current explicit <a href="debugger.changing_contexts#register_context#register_context">register context</a>.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DEBUG_REGSRC_FRAME

</td>
<td>
Fetch register information from the current scope's register context.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    Stack unwinding does not guarantee accurate updating of the register context, so the scope frame's register context might not be accurate in all cases.</div>
<div> </div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -param Offset [out]

Receives the location in the process's virtual address space of the current instruction of the current thread.


## -returns
This list does not contain all the errors that might occur.  For a list of possible errors, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549771">HRESULT Values</a>.
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The method was successful.

 


## -remarks
The meaning of the value that is returned by this method is architecture-dependent.  In particular, for an Itanium-based processor, the virtual address that is returned can indicate an address within a bundle.

The method <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546916">GetInstructionOffset</a> performs the same task as this method but always uses the target as the register source.
