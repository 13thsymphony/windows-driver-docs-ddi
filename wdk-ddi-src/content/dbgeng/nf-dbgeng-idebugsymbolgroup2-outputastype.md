# IDebugSymbolGroup2::OutputAsType method



## -description
The <b>OutputAsType</b>  method changes the type of a symbol in a symbol group.  The symbol's entry is updated to represent the new type. 



## -syntax

````
HRESULT OutputAsType(
  [in] ULONG Index,
  [in] PCSTR Type
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Index [in]

The index of the entry in this symbol group.  The <i>index</i> of a symbol is an identification number. The index ranges from zero through the number of symbols in the symbol group minus one.


### -param Type [in]

The name of the type of the symbol that you want.  If the name begins with an exclamation mark (<b>!</b>), the name is treated as an extension.  For more information about how to use an extension as a type, see the Remarks section.


## -returns
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The method was successful.

 

This method can also return error values.  For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/713f3ee2-2f5b-415e-9908-90f5ae428b43">Return Values</a>.


## -remarks
Because the children of the new entry type might differ from the children of the old entry type, the <b>OutputAsType</b> method removes all of the children of the entry from the symbol group.  You can add the children back by using the <a href="debugger.expandsymbol">ExpandSymbol</a> method.

If <i>Type</i> is an extension, the address of the symbol is passed to the extension.  Every line of output from the extension becomes a child symbol of the specified symbol.  These child symbols are text and you cannot manipulate them in any way.  For example, if the name of a variable is <b>@$teb</b>, you can change its type to <b>!teb</b>.

For more information about symbol groups, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554702">Scopes and Symbol Groups</a>.
