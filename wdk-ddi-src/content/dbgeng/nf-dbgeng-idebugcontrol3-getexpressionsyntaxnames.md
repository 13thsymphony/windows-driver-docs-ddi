# GetExpressionSyntaxNames method
The <b>GetExpressionSyntaxNames</b>  method returns the full and abbreviated names of an expression syntax.

## Syntax

````
HRESULT GetExpressionSyntaxNames(
  [in]            ULONG  Index,
  [out, optional] PSTR   FullNameBuffer,
  [in]            ULONG  FullNameBufferSize,
  [out, optional] PULONG FullNameSize,
  [out, optional] PSTR   AbbrevNameBuffer,
  [in]            ULONG  AbbrevNameBufferSize,
  [out, optional] PULONG AbbrevNameSize
);
````

## Parameters

`Index`

Specifies the index of the expression syntax.  <i>Index</i> should be between zero and the number of expression syntaxes returned by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547913">GetNumberExpressionSyntaxes</a> minus one.

`FullNameBuffer`

Receives the full name of the expression syntax.  If <i>FullNameBuffer</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.

`FullNameBufferSize`

Specifies the size, in characters, of the buffer <i>FullNameBuffer</i>.

`FullNameSize`

Receives the size, in characters, of the full name of the expression syntax.  If <i>FullNameSize</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.

`AbbrevNameBuffer`

Receives the abbreviated name of the expression syntax.  If <i>AbbrevNameBuffer</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.

`AbbrevNameBufferSize`

Specifies the size, in characters, of the buffer <i>AbbrevNameBufferSize</i>.

`AbbrevNameSize`

Receives the size, in characters, of the abbreviated name of the expression syntax.  If <i>AbbrevNameSize</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.


## Return Value

This method can also return error values.  See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/713f3ee2-2f5b-415e-9908-90f5ae428b43">Return Values</a> for more details.
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The method was successful.
<dl>
<dt><b>S_FALSE</b></dt>
</dl>The method was successful.  However, either <i>FullNameBufferSize</i> or <i>AbbrevNameBufferSize</i> was smaller than the size of the respective expression syntax name, and the name was truncated to fit inside the buffer.

## Remarks

Currently, there are two expression syntaxes, their full names are "Microsoft Assembler expressions" and "C++ source expressions."  The corresponding abbreviated expression syntaxes are "MASM" and "C++."
