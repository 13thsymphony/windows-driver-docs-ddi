# PDEBUG_EXTENSION_INITIALIZE callback



## -description
The <b>DebugExtensionInitialize</b> callback function is called by the engine after loading a DbgEng extension DLL.



## -prototype

````
 CALLBACK* PDEBUG_EXTENSION_INITIALIZE DebugExtensionInitialize;
````


## -parameters

### -param Version [out]

Receives the version of the extension.  The high 16 bits contain the major version number, and the low 16 bits contain the minor version number.


### -param Flags [out]

Set this to zero. (Reserved for future use.)


## -returns
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The extension was successfully initialized.

 

Any other value indicates that the extension DLL was unable to initialize and the engine will unload it.


## -remarks
The engine looks for this function by name in each extension DLL.  This function must be exported by a DbgEng extension DLL.

The version number can be set by using the macro DEBUG_EXTENSION_VERSION found in dbgeng.h, for example:

Implementations of this function should initialize any global variables required by the extension DLL.

There may or may not be a session active when this function is called, so the extension should not assume that it is able to query session information.

 The function type is defined as PDEBUG_EXTENSION_INITIALIZE in dbgeng.h.
