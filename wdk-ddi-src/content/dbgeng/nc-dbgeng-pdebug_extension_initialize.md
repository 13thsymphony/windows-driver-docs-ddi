# PDEBUG_EXTENSION_INITIALIZE callback function
The <b>DebugExtensionInitialize</b> callback function is called by the engine after loading a DbgEng extension DLL.
<div class="code"><span codelanguage="ManagedCPlusPlus"><table>
<tr>
<th>C++</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre> CALLBACK* PDEBUG_EXTENSION_INITIALIZE DebugExtensionInitialize;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>

## Syntax

```
PDEBUG_EXTENSION_INITIALIZE PdebugExtensionInitialize;

HRESULT PdebugExtensionInitialize(
  PULONG Version,
  PULONG Flags
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Version`

Receives the version of the extension.  The high 16 bits contain the major version number, and the low 16 bits contain the minor version number.

`Flags`

Set this to zero. (Reserved for future use.)


## Return Value

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The extension was successfully initialized.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

Any other value indicates that the extension DLL was unable to initialize and the engine will unload it.

## Remarks

The engine looks for this function by name in each extension DLL.  This function must be exported by a DbgEng extension DLL.

The version number can be set by using the macro DEBUG_EXTENSION_VERSION found in dbgeng.h, for example:

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>*Version = DEBUG_EXTENSION_VERSION(Major, Minor)</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
Implementations of this function should initialize any global variables required by the extension DLL.

There may or may not be a session active when this function is called, so the extension should not assume that it is able to query session information.

 The function type is defined as PDEBUG_EXTENSION_INITIALIZE in dbgeng.h.
