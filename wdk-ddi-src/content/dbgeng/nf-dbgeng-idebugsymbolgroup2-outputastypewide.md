# OutputAsTypeWide method
The <b>OutputAsTypeWide</b> method changes the type of a symbol in a symbol group.  The symbol's entry is updated to represent the new type.

## Syntax

````
HRESULT OutputAsTypeWide(
  [in] ULONG  Index,
  [in] PCWSTR Type
);
````

## Parameters

`Index`

The index of the entry in this symbol group.  The <i>index</i> of a symbol is an identification number. The index ranges from zero through the number of symbols in the symbol group minus one.

`Type`

The name of the type of the symbol that you want.  If the name begins with an exclamation mark (<b>!</b>), the name is treated as an extension.  For more information about how to use an extension as a type, see the Remarks section.


## Return Value

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method was successful.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

This method can also return error values.  For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/713f3ee2-2f5b-415e-9908-90f5ae428b43">Return Values</a>.

## Remarks

Because the children of the new entry type might differ from the children of the old entry type, the <b>OutputAsTypeWide</b> method removes all of the children of the entry from the symbol group.  You can add the children back by using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543271">ExpandSymbol</a> method.

If <i>Type</i> is an extension, the address of the symbol is passed to the extension.  Every line of output from the extension becomes a child symbol of the specified symbol.  These child symbols are text and you cannot manipulate them in any way.  For example, if the name of a variable is <b>@$teb</b>, you can change its type to <b>!teb</b>.

For more information about symbol groups, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554702">Scopes and Symbol Groups</a>.
