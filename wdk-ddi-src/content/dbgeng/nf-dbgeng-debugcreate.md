The <b>DebugCreate</b> function creates a new client object and returns an interface pointer to it.

## Syntax

````
HRESULT DebugCreate(
  _In_  REFIID InterfaceId,
  _Out_ PVOID  *Interface
);
````

## Parameters

`InterfaceId`

Specifies the interface identifier (IID) of the desired debugger engine client interface.  This is the type of the interface that will be returned in <i>Interface</i>. For information about the interface identifier, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560088">Using Client Objects</a>.

`Interface`

Receives an interface pointer for the new client.  The type of this interface is specified by <i>InterfaceId</i>.


## Return Value

## Remarks
