# IDebugEventCallbacks interface



## -description

## -inheritance
The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IDebugEventCallbacks</b> interface inherits from the <a href="com.iunknown" xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n"><b>IUnknown</b></a> interface. <b>IDebugEventCallbacks</b> also has these types of members:

The <b>IDebugEventCallbacks</b> interface has these methods.

 This method is called by the engine when the target issues a breakpoint exception.

This method is called by the engine when it makes or detects changes to the target.

This method is called by the engine when its state has changed.

This method is called by the engine when the symbol state changes.

This method is called by the engine when a create-process debugging event occurs in the target.

This method is called by the engine when a create-thread debugging event occurs in the target.

This method is called by the engine when an exception debugging event occurs in the target.

This method is called by the engine when an exit-process debugging event occurs in the target.

This method is called by the engine when an exit-thread debugging event occurs in the target.

This method is called to determine which events the <b>IDebugEventCallbacks</b> object is interested in.

This method is called by the engine when a module-load debugging event occurs in the target.

This method is called by the engine when a change occurs in the debugger session.

This method is called by the engine when a system error occurs in the target.

This method is called by the engine when a module-unload debugging event occurs in the target.
