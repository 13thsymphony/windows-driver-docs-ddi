# IDebugDataSpaces4::ReadVirtualUncached method



## -description
The <b>ReadVirtualUncached</b> method reads memory from the target's virtual address space.



## -syntax

````
HRESULT ReadVirtualUncached(
  [in]            ULONG64 Offset,
  [out]           PVOID   Buffer,
  [in]            ULONG   BufferSize,
  [out, optional] PULONG  BytesRead
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Offset [in]

Specifies the location in the target's virtual address space to be read.


### -param Buffer [out]

Specifies the buffer to read the memory into.


### -param BufferSize [in]

Specifies the size in bytes of the buffer.  This is also the number of bytes being requested.


### -param BytesRead [out, optional]

Receives the number of bytes that were read.  If it is set to <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.


## -returns
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The method was successful.  It is possible that <i>BytesRead</i> is less than <i>BufferSize</i>, but at least one byte of data is being returned.

 

This method can also return error values.  See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/713f3ee2-2f5b-415e-9908-90f5ae428b43">Return Values</a> for more details.


## -remarks
This method fills the buffer with the contents of the memory in the target's virtual address space.

This method behaves identically to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554359">ReadVirtual</a>, except that it avoids using the virtual memory cache.  It is therefore useful for reading inherently volatile virtual memory, such as memory-mapped device areas, without contaminating or invalidating the cache.
