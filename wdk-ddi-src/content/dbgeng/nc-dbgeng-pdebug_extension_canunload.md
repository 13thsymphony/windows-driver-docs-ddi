# PDEBUG_EXTENSION_CANUNLOAD callback



## -description
The <i>DebugExtensionCanUnload</i> callback function checks whether a debug extension can unload after the uninitialization call. 



## -prototype

````
 CALLBACK* PDEBUG_EXTENSION_CANUNLOAD DebugExtensionCanUnload;
````


## -parameters


## -returns
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The extension was successfully initialized.

 

Any other value indicates that the extension DLL was unable to initialize and the engine will unload it.
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The extension was successfully initialized.

 

Any other value indicates that the extension DLL was unable to initialize and the engine will unload it.
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The extension was successfully initialized.

 

Any other value indicates that the extension DLL was unable to initialize and the engine will unload it.


## -remarks
If present, this callback function is called between the <a href="..\dbgeng\nc-dbgeng-pdebug_extension_uninitialize.md">DebugExtensionUninitialize</a> callback function and actual unload of the DLL. The extension should return either <b>S_OK</b>, if no objects are present which would prevent unload of the extension, or <b>S_FALSE</b>, if there are still outstanding references to model objects in the debugger extension.

This callback function is the debugger's equivalent of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a47df9eb-97cb-4875-a121-1dabe7bc9db6">DllCanUnloadNow</a> for extensions which manipulate the object model of the debugger.

<i>DebugExtensionCanUnload</i> is called <b>PDEBUG_EXTENSION_CANUNLOAD</b> in the Dbgeng.h header file.
