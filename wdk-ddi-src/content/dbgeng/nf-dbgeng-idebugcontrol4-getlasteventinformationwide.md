# GetLastEventInformationWide method
The <b>GetLastEventInformationWide</b>  method returns information about the last event that occurred in a target.

## Syntax

````
HRESULT GetLastEventInformationWide(
  [out]           PULONG Type,
  [out]           PULONG ProcessId,
  [out]           PULONG ThreadId,
  [out, optional] PVOID  ExtraInformation,
  [in]            ULONG  ExtraInformationSize,
  [out, optional] PULONG ExtraInformationUsed,
  [out, optional] PWSTR  Description,
  [in]            ULONG  DescriptionSize,
  [out, optional] PULONG DescriptionUsed
);
````

## Parameters

`Type`

Receives the type of the last event generated by the target.  For a list of possible types, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541478">DEBUG_EVENT_XXX</a>.

`ProcessId`

Receives the process ID of the process in which the event occurred.  If this information is not available, DEBUG_ANY_ID will be returned instead.

`ThreadId`

Receives the thread ID of the thread in which the last event occurred.  If this information is not available, DEBUG_ANY_ID will be returned instead.

`ExtraInformation`

Receives extra information about the event.  The contents of this extra information depends on the type of the event as indicated by the returned <i>Type</i> parameter. For example, if <i>Type</i> is breakpoint, <i>ExtraInformation</i> contains a DEBUG_LAST_EVENT_INFO_BREAKPOINT; if Type is Exception, ExtraInformation contains a DEBUG_LAST_EVENT_INFO_EXCEPTION. Refer to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541478">DEBUG_EVENT_XXX</a> for the complete list of event types and the dbgeng.h header file for the structure definitions for each event type. 

  If <i>ExtraInformation</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.

`ExtraInformationSize`

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the buffer that <i>ExtraInformation</i> specifies.

`ExtraInformationUsed`

Receives the size, in bytes, of extra information.  If <i>ExtraInformationUsed</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.

`Description`

Receives the description of the event.  If <i>Description</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.

`DescriptionSize`

Specifies the size, in characters, of the buffer that <i>Description</i> specifies.

`DescriptionUsed`

Receives the size in characters of the description of the event.  If <i>DescriptionUsed </i>is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.


## Return Value
