## -parameters

### -param Type [out]

Receives the type of the last event generated by the target.  For a list of possible types, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541478">DEBUG_EVENT_XXX</a>.


### -param ProcessId [out]

Receives the process ID of the process in which the event occurred.  If this information is not available, DEBUG_ANY_ID will be returned instead.

### -param ExtraInformation [out, optional]

Receives extra information about the event.  The contents of this extra information depends on the type of the event as indicated by the returned <i>Type</i> parameter. For example, if <i>Type</i> is breakpoint, <i>ExtraInformation</i> contains a DEBUG_LAST_EVENT_INFO_BREAKPOINT; if Type is Exception, ExtraInformation contains a DEBUG_LAST_EVENT_INFO_EXCEPTION. Refer to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541478">DEBUG_EVENT_XXX</a> for the complete list of event types and the dbgeng.h header file for the structure definitions for each event type. 

  If <i>ExtraInformation</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.


### -param ExtraInformationSize [in]

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the buffer that <i>ExtraInformation</i> specifies.


### -param ExtraInformationUsed [out, optional]

Receives the size, in bytes, of extra information.  If <i>ExtraInformationUsed</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.


### -param Description [out, optional]

Receives the description of the event.  If <i>Description</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.


### -param DescriptionSize [in]

Specifies the size, in characters, of the buffer that <i>Description</i> specifies.


### -param DescriptionUsed [out, optional]

Receives the size in characters of the description of the event.  If <i>DescriptionUsed </i>is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.
