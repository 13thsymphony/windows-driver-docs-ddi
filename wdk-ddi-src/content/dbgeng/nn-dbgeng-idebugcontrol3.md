## -description

## -inheritance
The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IDebugControl3</b> interface inherits from <a href="..\dbgeng\nn-dbgeng-idebugcontrol2.md">IDebugControl2</a>. <b>IDebugControl3</b> also has these types of members:

The <b>IDebugControl3</b> interface has these methods.

Turns on some of the assembly and disassembly options.


Returns the assembly and disassembly options that affect how the debugger engine assembles and disassembles processor instructions for the target.

Returns the index of the current event within the current list of events for the current target, if such a list exists.


Describes the specified event in a static list of events for the current target.


Returns the current syntax that the engine is using for evaluating expressions.


Returns the full and abbreviated names of an expression syntax.


Returns the number of events for the current target, if the number of events is fixed.


Returns the number of expression syntaxes that are supported by the engine.


 Turns off some of the assembly and disassembly options.

Sets the assembly and disassembly options that affect how the debugger engine assembles and disassembles processor instructions for the target.


Sets the syntax that the engine will use to evaluate expressions.


Sets the syntax that the engine will use to evaluate expressions.


Sets the next event for the current target by selecting the event from the static list of events for the target, if such a list exists.
