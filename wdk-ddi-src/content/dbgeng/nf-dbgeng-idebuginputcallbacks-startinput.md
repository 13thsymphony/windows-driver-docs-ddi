# IDebugInputCallbacks::StartInput method



## -description
The <b>StartInput</b> callback method is called by the engine to indicate that it is waiting for a line of input.



## -syntax

````
HRESULT StartInput(
  [in]Â ULONG BufferSize
);
````


## -parameters

### -param BufferSize [in]

Specifies the number of characters requested.  Any input longer than this size will be truncated.


## -returns
The return value is ignored by the engine unless it indicates a remote procedure call error; in this case the client, with which this <b>IDebugEventCallbacks</b> object is registered, is disabled.


## -remarks
This method indicates that the engine is waiting for a line of input from any client.  This can occur if, for example, the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550962">Input</a> method was called on a client.

After calling this method, the engine waits until it receives some input.  When it does receive input, it calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550791">IDebugInputCallbacks::EndInput</a> to inform all the <b>IDebugInputCallbacks</b> objects that are registered with clients that it is no longer waiting for input.

The <b>IDebugInputCallbacks</b> object can provide the engine with a line of input by calling either the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554600">ReturnInput</a> or <b>ReturnInputWide</b> methods.

For more information about debugger engine input, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550971">Input and Output</a>.</p>
