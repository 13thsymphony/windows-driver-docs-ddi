# IDebugInputCallbacks::StartInput method



## -description
<p>The <b>StartInput</b> callback method is called by the engine to indicate that it is waiting for a line of input.</p>


## -syntax

````
HRESULT StartInput(
  [in]Â ULONG BufferSize
);
````


## -parameters
<dl>

### -param <i>BufferSize</i> [in]

<dd>
<p>Specifies the number of characters requested.  Any input longer than this size will be truncated.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

## -returns
<p>The return value is ignored by the engine unless it indicates a remote procedure call error; in this case the client, with which this <b>IDebugEventCallbacks</b> object is registered, is disabled.</p>

## -remarks
<p>This method indicates that the engine is waiting for a line of input from any client.  This can occur if, for example, the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550962">Input</a> method was called on a client.</p>

<p>After calling this method, the engine waits until it receives some input.  When it does receive input, it calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550791">IDebugInputCallbacks::EndInput</a> to inform all the <b>IDebugInputCallbacks</b> objects that are registered with clients that it is no longer waiting for input.</p>

<p>The <b>IDebugInputCallbacks</b> object can provide the engine with a line of input by calling either the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554600">ReturnInput</a> or <b>ReturnInputWide</b> methods.</p>
