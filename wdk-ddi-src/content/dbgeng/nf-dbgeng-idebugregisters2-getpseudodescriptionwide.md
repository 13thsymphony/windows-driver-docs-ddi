# GetPseudoDescriptionWide method
The <b>GetPseudoDescriptionWide</b> method returns a description of a pseudo-register, including its name and type.

## Syntax

````
HRESULT GetPseudoDescriptionWide(
  [in]            ULONG    Register,
  [out, optional] PWSTR    NameBuffer,
  [in]            ULONG    NameBufferSize,
  [out, optional] PULONG   NameSize,
  [out, optional] PULONG64 TypeModule,
  [out, optional] PULONG   TypeId
);
````

## Parameters

`Register`

Specifies the index of the pseudo-register whose description is requested.  The index is always between zero and the number of pseudo-registers (returned by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547957">GetNumberPseudoRegisters</a>) minus one.

`NameBuffer`

Receives the name of the pseudo-register.  If <i>NameBuffer</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.

`NameBufferSize`

Specifies the size, in characters, of the buffer that <i>NameBuffer </i>specifies.

`NameSize`

Receives the size in characters of the name of the pseudo-register.  If <i>NameSize</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.

`TypeModule`

Receives the base address of the module to which the register's type belongs.  If the type of the register is not known, zero is returned.  If <i>TypeModule</i> is <b>NULL</b>, no information is returned.

`TypeId`

Receives the type ID of the type within the module returned in <i>TypeModule</i>.  If the type ID is not known, zero is returned.  If <i>TypeId</i> is <b>NULL</b>, no information is returned.


## Return Value

This list does not contain all the errors that might occur.  For a list of possible errors, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549771">HRESULT Values</a>.

## Remarks

Descriptions are not always available for all registers.  If a pseudo-register does not have a value - for example, <b>$eventip</b> will not have a value before an event has occurred - or a type cannot be determined for a pseudo-register, this method will return E_FAIL.
