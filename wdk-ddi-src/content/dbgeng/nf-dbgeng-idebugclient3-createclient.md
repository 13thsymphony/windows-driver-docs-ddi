## Remarks

This method creates a client that may be used in the current thread.

Clients are specific to the thread that created them.  Calls from other threads fail immediately.  The <b>CreateClient</b> method is a notable exception; it allows creation of a new client for a new thread. 

All callbacks for a client are made in the thread with which the client was created.

For more information about client objects and how they are used in the debugger engine, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff539140">Client Objects</a>.
