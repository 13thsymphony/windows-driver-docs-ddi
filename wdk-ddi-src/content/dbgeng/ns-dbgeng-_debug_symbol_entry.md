# _DEBUG_SYMBOL_ENTRY structure
The DEBUG_SYMBOL_ENTRY structure describes a symbol in a symbol group.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DEBUG_SYMBOL_ENTRY {
  ULONG64 ModuleBase;
  ULONG64 Offset;
  ULONG64 Id;
  ULONG64 Arg64;
  ULONG   Size;
  ULONG   Flags;
  ULONG   TypeId;
  ULONG   NameSize;
  ULONG   Token;
  ULONG   Tag;
  ULONG   Arg32;
  ULONG   Reserved;
}  DEBUG_SYMBOL_ENTRY, *PDEBUG_SYMBOL_ENTRY;
````

## Members


`Arg32`

The interpretation of <b>Arg32</b> depends on the type of the symbol.  Currently, the value of <b>Arg32</b> is the register that holds the value or a pointer to the value of the symbol. If the symbol is not held in a register, or the register is not known, <b>Arg32</b> is zero.

`Arg64`

The interpretation of <b>Arg64</b> depends on the type of the symbol.  If the value is not known, <b>Arg64</b> is zero.

`Flags`

Symbol entry flags.  Currently, no flags are defined.

`Id`

The symbol ID of the symbol.  If the symbol ID is not known, <b>Id</b> is DEBUG_INVALID_OFFSET.

`ModuleBase`

The base address of the module in the target's virtual address space.

`NameSize`

The size, in characters, of the symbol's name.  If the size is not known, <b>NameSize</b> is zero.

`Offset`

The location of the symbol in the target's virtual address space.

`Reserved`

Set to zero.

`Size`

The size, in bytes, of the symbol's value.  This might not be known or might not completely represent all of the data for a symbol.  For example, a function's code might be split among multiple regions and the size only describes one region.

`Tag`

The symbol tag for the type of the symbol.  This is a value from the <b>SymTagEnum</b> enumeration.

`Token`

The managed token of the symbol.  If the token value is not known or the symbol does not have a token, <b>Token</b> is zero.

`TypeId`

The type ID of the symbol.
