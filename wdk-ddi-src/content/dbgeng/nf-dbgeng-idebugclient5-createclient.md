# CreateClient method
The <b>CreateClient</b> method creates a new client object for the current thread.

## Syntax

````
HRESULT CreateClient(
  [out] IDebugClient **Client
);
````

## Parameters

`Client`

Receives an interface pointer for the new client.


## Return Value

This method may also return error values.  See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/713f3ee2-2f5b-415e-9908-90f5ae428b43">Return Values</a> for more details. 
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The method was successful.

## Remarks

This method creates a client that may be used in the current thread.

Clients are specific to the thread that created them.  Calls from other threads fail immediately.  The <b>CreateClient</b> method is a notable exception; it allows creation of a new client for a new thread. 

All callbacks for a client are made in the thread with which the client was created.

For more information about client objects and how they are used in the debugger engine, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff539140">Client Objects</a>.
