# DebugConnectWide function
The <a href="..\dbgeng\nf-dbgeng-debugconnect.md">DebugConnect</a> and <b>DebugConnectWide</b> functions create a new <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/173a67f1-093e-4462-8e2c-41d0f10106d0">client object</a> and return an interface pointer to it.  The client object will be connected to a remote host.

## Syntax

````
HRESULT DebugConnectWide(
  _In_  PCSTR  RemoteOptions,
  _In_  REFIID InterfaceId,
  _Out_ PVOID  *Interface
);
````

## Parameters

`RemoteOptions`

Specifies how the debugger engine will connect to the remote host.  These are the same options that get passed to the <b>-remote</b> option on the command line.  For details on the syntax of this string, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537819">Activating a Debugging Client</a>.

`InterfaceId`

Specifies the interface identifier (IID) of the desired debugger engine client interface.  This is the type of the interface that will be returned in <i>Interface</i>. For information about the interface identifier, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560088">Using Client Objects</a>.

`Interface`

Receives an interface pointer for the new client.  The type of this interface is specified by <i>InterfaceId</i>.
