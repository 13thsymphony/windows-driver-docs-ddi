# _USB_NODE_CONNECTION_INFORMATION_EX_V2_FLAGS structure
The <b>USB_NODE_CONNECTION_INFORMATION_EX_V2_FLAGS</b> union is used to indicate the speed at which a USB 3.0  device is currently operating and whether it can operate at higher speed, when attached to a particular port. 

Device speed information is obtained in the <a href="..\usbioctl\ns-usbioctl-_usb_node_connection_information_ex_v2.md">USB_NODE_CONNECTION_INFORMATION_EX_V2</a> structure by the <a href="..\usbioctl\ni-usbioctl-ioctl_usb_get_node_connection_information_ex_v2.md">IOCTL_USB_GET_NODE_CONNECTION_INFORMATION_EX_V2</a> I/O control request.

Or: the speed in which a device attached to a port is currently operating and at what speeds it is capable of operating.

## Syntax
````
typedef union _USB_NODE_CONNECTION_INFORMATION_EX_V2_FLAGS {
  ULONG  ul;
  struct {
    ULONG DeviceIsOperatingAtSuperSpeedOrHigher  :1;
