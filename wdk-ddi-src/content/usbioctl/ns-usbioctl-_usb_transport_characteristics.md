# _USB_TRANSPORT_CHARACTERISTICS structure
Stores the transport characteristics at relevant points in time. This structure is used in the  <a href="..\usbioctl\ni-usbioctl-ioctl_usb_get_transport_characteristics.md">IOCTL_USB_GET_TRANSPORT_CHARACTERISTICS</a> request.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _USB_TRANSPORT_CHARACTERISTICS {
  ULONG                       Version;
  ULONG                       TransportCharacteristicsFlags;
  ULONG64                     CurrentRoundtripLatencyInMilliSeconds;
  ULONG64                     MaxPotentialBandwidth;
} USB_TRANSPORT_CHARACTERISTICS, *PUSB_TRANSPORT_CHARACTERISTICS;
````

## Members


`CurrentRoundtripLatencyInMilliSeconds`

Contains the current round-trip delay in milliseconds from the time a non-isochronous transfer is received by the USB driver stack to the time that the transfer is completed.  

For MA-USB, the underlying network could be WiFi, WiGig, Ethernet etc. The delay can vary depending on the underlying network conditions. A client driver should query the latency periodically or whenever it is notified of a change.

`MaxPotentialBandwidth`

Contains the total bandwidth of the host controller’s shared transport. 

For MA-USB, the underlying network transport could be WiFi, WiGig, Ethernet etc. The total available bandwidth can vary depending on several factors such as the negotiation WiFi channel. A client driver should query the total bandwidth periodically or whenever it is notified of a change.

`TransportCharacteristicsFlags`

A bitmask that indicates to the client driver the transport characteristics that are available and are returned in this structure. 




If USB_TRANSPORT_CHARACTERISTICS_LATENCY_AVAILABLE 

is set, <b>CurrentRoundtripLatencyInMilliSeconds</b> contains valid information. Otherwise , it must not be used by the client driver. 




If USB_TRANSPORT_CHARACTERISTICS_BANDWIDTH_AVAILABLE 

is set, <b>MaxPotentialBandwidth</b> contains valid information. Otherwise, it must not be used by the client driver.

`Version`

The version is set to  USB_TRANSPORT_CHARACTERISTICS_VERSION_1.
