# _USB_TRANSPORT_CHARACTERISTICS structure



## -description
Stores the transport characteristics at relevant points in time. This structure is used in the  <a href="..\usbioctl\ni-usbioctl-ioctl_usb_get_transport_characteristics.md">IOCTL_USB_GET_TRANSPORT_CHARACTERISTICS</a> request.


## -syntax

````
typedef struct _USB_TRANSPORT_CHARACTERISTICS {
  ULONG                       Version;
  ULONG                       TransportCharacteristicsFlags;
  ULONG64                     CurrentRoundtripLatencyInMilliSeconds;
  ULONG64                     MaxPotentialBandwidth;
} USB_TRANSPORT_CHARACTERISTICS, *PUSB_TRANSPORT_CHARACTERISTICS;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field                     Version

The version is set to  USB_TRANSPORT_CHARACTERISTICS_VERSION_1. 


### -field                     TransportCharacteristicsFlags

A bitmask that indicates to the client driver the transport characteristics that are available and are returned in this structure. 



If USB_TRANSPORT_CHARACTERISTICS_LATENCY_AVAILABLE 

is set, <b>CurrentRoundtripLatencyInMilliSeconds</b> contains valid information. Otherwise , it must not be used by the client driver. 



If USB_TRANSPORT_CHARACTERISTICS_BANDWIDTH_AVAILABLE 

is set, <b>MaxPotentialBandwidth</b> contains valid information. Otherwise, it must not be used by the client driver.  

### -field                     CurrentRoundtripLatencyInMilliSeconds

Contains the current round-trip delay in milliseconds from the time a non-isochronous transfer is received by the USB driver stack to the time that the transfer is completed.  

For MA-USB, the underlying network could be WiFi, WiGig, Ethernet etc. The delay can vary depending on the underlying network conditions. A client driver should query the latency periodically or whenever it is notified of a change. 


### -field                     MaxPotentialBandwidth

Contains the total bandwidth of the host controller’s shared transport. 

For MA-USB, the underlying network transport could be WiFi, WiGig, Ethernet etc. The total available bandwidth can vary depending on several factors such as the negotiation WiFi channel. A client driver should query the total bandwidth periodically or whenever it is notified of a change.
