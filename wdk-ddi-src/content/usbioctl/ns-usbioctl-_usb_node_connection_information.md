# _USB_NODE_CONNECTION_INFORMATION structure
The <b>USB_NODE_CONNECTION_INFORMATION</b> structure is used with the <a href="..\usbioctl\ni-usbioctl-ioctl_usb_get_node_connection_information.md">IOCTL_USB_GET_NODE_CONNECTION_INFORMATION</a>  request to retrieve information about a USB port and connected device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _USB_NODE_CONNECTION_INFORMATION {
  ULONG                 ConnectionIndex;
  USB_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR DeviceDescriptor;
  UCHAR                 CurrentConfigurationValue;
  BOOLEAN               LowSpeed;
  BOOLEAN               DeviceIsHub;
  USHORT                DeviceAddress;
  ULONG                 NumberOfOpenPipes;
  USB_CONNECTION_STATUS ConnectionStatus;
  USB_PIPE_INFO         PipeList[];
} USB_NODE_CONNECTION_INFORMATION, *PUSB_NODE_CONNECTION_INFORMATION;
````

## Members


`ConnectionIndex`

A value that is greater than or equal to 1 that specifies the number of the port.

`ConnectionStatus`

A <a href="..\usbioctl\ne-usbioctl-_usb_connection_status.md">USB_CONNECTION_STATUS</a>-typed enumerator that indicates the connection status.

`CurrentConfigurationValue`

The value that is used with the SetConfiguration request to specify that current configuration of the device that is connected to the indicated port. For more information about this member, see Universal Serial Bus Specification.

`DeviceAddress`

The USB-assigned, bus-relative address of the device that is attached to the port.

`DeviceDescriptor`

A <a href="..\usbspec\ns-usbspec-_usb_device_descriptor.md">USB_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR</a> structure that reports the USB device descriptor that is returned by the attached device during enumeration.

`DeviceIsHub`

A Boolean value that indicates if the device that is attached to the port is a hub. If <b>TRUE</b>, the device that is attached to the port is a hub. If <b>FALSE</b>, the device is not a hub.

`LowSpeed`

A Boolean value that indicates whether the port and its connected device are operating at low speed. <b>TRUE</b> indicates that the port and its connected device are currently operating at a low speed. <b>FALSE</b> indicates otherwise.

`NumberOfOpenPipes`

The number of open USB pipes that are associated with the port.

`PipeList`

An array of <a href="..\usbioctl\ns-usbioctl-_usb_pipe_info.md">USB_PIPE_INFO</a> structures  that describes the open pipes that are associated with the port. Pipe descriptions include the schedule offset of the pipe and the associated endpoint descriptor. This information can be used to calculate bandwidth usage.

## Remarks
If there is no device connected to the USB port, <a href="..\usbioctl\ni-usbioctl-ioctl_usb_get_node_connection_information.md">IOCTL_USB_GET_NODE_CONNECTION_INFORMATION</a> returns only information about the port. If a device is connected to the port, <b>IOCTL_USB_GET_NODE_CONNECTION_INFORMATION</b> returns information about both the port and the connected device.

The <a href="..\usbioctl\ns-usbioctl-_usb_node_connection_information_ex.md">USB_NODE_CONNECTION_INFORMATION_EX</a> structure is an extended version of <b>USB_NODE_CONNECTION_INFORMATION</b>. The two structures are identical, except for one member. In <b>USB_NODE_CONNECTION_INFORMATION_EX</b>, the <b>LowSpeed</b> member is replaced by the <b>Speed</b> member. <b>LowSpeed</b> is a Boolean value, so when it is <b>TRUE</b>, the device is low speed. When it is <b>FALSE</b>, the device is high speed or full speed. Thus the <b>USB_NODE_CONNECTION_INFORMATION</b> structure cannot differentiate between high and full speeds. 

The <b>Speed</b> member of the <a href="..\usbioctl\ns-usbioctl-_usb_node_connection_information_ex.md">USB_NODE_CONNECTION_INFORMATION_EX</a> structure is a UCHAR and it can specify any of the values of the <a href="..\usbspec\ne-usbspec-_usb_device_speed.md">USB_DEVICE_SPEED</a> enumerator.
