# _USB_DEVICE_CHARACTERISTICS structure



## -description
Contains information about the USB device’s characteristics, such as the maximum send and receive delays for any request.  This structure is used in the <a href="..\usbioctl\ni-usbioctl-ioctl_usb_get_device_characteristics.md">IOCTL_USB_GET_DEVICE_CHARACTERISTICS</a> request.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _USB_DEVICE_CHARACTERISTICS {
  ULONG                     Version;
  ULONG                     Reserved[2];
  ULONG                     UsbDeviceCharacteristicsFlags;
  ULONG                     MaximumSendPathDelayInMilliSeconds;
  ULONG                     MaximumCompletionPathDelayInMilliSeconds;
} USB_DEVICE_CHARACTERISTICS, *PUSB_DEVICE_CHARACTERISTICS;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field                     Version

The version should be set to USB_DEVICE_CHARACTERISTICS_VERSION_1. 



### -field                     Reserved

Reserved.


### -field                     UsbDeviceCharacteristicsFlags

A bitmask of flags that indicates to  the client driver the transport characteristics that are available and are returned by this structure. 


If the USB_DEVICE_CHARACTERISTICS_MAXIMUM_PATH_DELAYS_AVAILABLE  

flag is set, <b>MaximumSendPathDelayInMilliSeconds</b> and <b>MaximumCompletionPathDelayInMilliSeconds</b> contain valid information. Otherwise they are not available and must not be used by the client driver. 



### -field                     MaximumSendPathDelayInMilliSeconds

Contains the maximum delay in milliseconds for any request that is submitted by the client driver and is received by the USB driver stack to the time it is programmed in the host controller, including the maximum delay associated with the network medium if it is a MA-USB host controller. 
 



### -field                     MaximumCompletionPathDelayInMilliSeconds

Contains the maximum delay in milliseconds the host controller completes any request for the device to the time the request is completed and sent back to the client driver.  For a MA-USB controller this includes any delay associated with the network medium.
