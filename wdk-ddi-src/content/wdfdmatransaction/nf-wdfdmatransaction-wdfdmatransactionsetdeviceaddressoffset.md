# WdfDmaTransactionSetDeviceAddressOffset function
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF only]


   The 
  <b>WdfDmaTransactionSetDeviceAddressOffset</b> method specifies the offset of the register that the system DMA controller will access when performing the DMA operation.

## Syntax

````
void WdfDmaTransactionSetDeviceAddressOffset(
  _In_ WDFDMATRANSACTION DmaTransaction,
  _In_ ULONG             Offset
);
````

## Parameters

`DmaTransaction`

A handle to a DMA transaction object that specifies the transaction to modify.

`Offset`

The offset of the register, from the <b>DeviceAddress</b> specified in <a href="..\wdfdmaenabler\ns-wdfdmaenabler-_wdf_dma_system_profile_config.md">WDF_DMA_SYSTEM_PROFILE_CONFIG</a>, to or from which DMA should be performed.


## Return Value

This method does not return a value.

## Remarks

<b>WdfDmaTransactionSetDeviceAddressOffset</b> must be used with a DMA enabler that specifies a system-mode DMA profile.

Framework-based drivers call <b>WdfDmaTransactionSetDeviceAddressOffset</b> after initializing a DMA transaction and before executing it.

A driver can use this method to access multiple registers within a device's register file.

For example, a driver might use DMA to access separate read and write registers in a device's register file.

To do so, the driver specifies the base address of the device's register file when configuring the enabler, and then sets the offset of the read or write register as necessary before executing the transaction.

If your driver calls this method on an operating system earlier than Windows 8, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/using-kmdf-verifier">the framework's verifier</a> reports an error.
