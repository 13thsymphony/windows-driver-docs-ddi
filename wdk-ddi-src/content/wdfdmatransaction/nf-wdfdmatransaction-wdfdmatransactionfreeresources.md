# WdfDmaTransactionFreeResources function
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF only]

The <b>WdfDmaTransactionFreeResources</b> method releases DMA resources that the driver previously allocated by calling <a href="..\wdfdmatransaction\nf-wdfdmatransaction-wdfdmatransactionallocateresources.md">WdfDmaTransactionAllocateResources</a>.

## Syntax

````
void WdfDmaTransactionFreeResources(
  _In_ WDFDMATRANSACTION DmaTransaction
);
````

## Parameters

`DmaTransaction`

A handle to the DMA transaction object that the driver provided in a previous call to <a href="..\wdfdmatransaction\nf-wdfdmatransaction-wdfdmatransactionallocateresources.md">WdfDmaTransactionAllocateResources</a>.


## Return Value

This method does not return a value.

## Remarks

<b>WdfDmaTransactionFreeResources</b> must be used with a DMA enabler that specifies a packet or system profile.

On operating systems earlier than Windows 8, <b>WdfDmaTransactionFreeResources</b> must be used with an enabler that specifies a single-packet DMA enabler.  Starting with  Windows 8, <b>WdfDmaTransactionFreeResources</b> can also be used with an enabler that specifies a system-mode DMA enabler.

  When called with a scatter/gather DMA enabler, <b>WdfDmaTransactionFreeResources</b> causes a verifier bug check.



The driver's call to <b>WdfDmaTransactionFreeResources</b> may cause the framework to call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c01b94b2-aabf-47dd-952a-06e481579614">EvtProgramDma</a> or <a href="..\wdfdmatransaction\nc-wdfdmatransaction-evt_wdf_reserve_dma.md">EvtReserveDma</a> immediately.

For more information about system-mode DMA, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/CCC77C15-69CA-44CB-8DEB-29F3EAEA44F6">Supporting System-Mode DMA</a>.
