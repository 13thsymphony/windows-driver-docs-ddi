# WdfPreDeviceRemove function
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF only]

The co-installer's <b>WdfPreDeviceRemove</b> function performs any operations that the co-installer might require before a non-Plug and Play (PnP) driver's installer deletes the driver's kernel-mode service.

## Syntax

````
ULONG WdfPreDeviceRemove(
  _In_     LPCWSTR InfPath,
  _In_opt_ LPCWSTR InfSectionName
);
````

## Parameters

`InfPath`

A pointer to a null-terminated wide-character string that contains the directory path to the driver's INF file. The driver's installer can obtain this string by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/1fbe6289-2ca8-4ca8-b004-ecf513f9b0bd">GetCurrentDirectory</a>, which is described in the Microsoft Windows SDK.

`InfSectionName`

A pointer to a null-terminated wide-character string that contains the <i>Wdf-install-section</i> name in the driver's INF file. For more information about this name, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/installing-the-framework-s-co-installer">Using the KMDF Co-installer</a>. If this pointer is <b>NULL</b>, the co-installer uses <b>WdfSection</b> for the name.


## Return Value

<b>WdfPreDeviceRemove</b> returns <b>ERROR_SUCCESS</b> if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, the function returns one of the additional <b>ERROR_XXX</b> values that are defined in Winerror.h.

## Remarks

The installer for the framework-based drivers of a non-PnP device must call <b>WdfPreDeviceRemove</b> before the installer calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5b0fc714-60e0-4ae3-8fa8-ace36dab2fb0">DeleteService</a>.

To obtain the address of the co-installer's <b>WdfPreDeviceRemove</b> function, the installer must call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a0d7fc09-f888-4f46-a571-d3719a627597">GetProcAddress</a> after the installer has called <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d936b4dd-058c-48e1-834b-b47ef6d8ef65">LoadLibrary</a> to load the co-installer.

For more information about the <b>WdfPreDeviceRemove</b> function and installers for framework-based drivers of non-PnP devices, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/99676d85-feb2-482c-a91b-cfc48be5904c">Installing a Non-PnP Driver</a>. For more information about <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5b0fc714-60e0-4ae3-8fa8-ace36dab2fb0">DeleteService</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a0d7fc09-f888-4f46-a571-d3719a627597">GetProcAddress</a>, and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d936b4dd-058c-48e1-834b-b47ef6d8ef65">LoadLibrary</a>, see the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.
