# _D3DHAL_DP2CREATELIGHT structure
The D3DHAL_DP2CREATELIGHT structure is used to create a light for <a href="..\d3dhal\nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a>.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DHAL_DP2CREATELIGHT {
  DWORD dwIndex;
} D3DHAL_DP2CREATELIGHT, *LPD3DHAL_DP2CREATELIGHT;
````

## Members


`dwIndex`

Specifies the index of the light being created.

## Remarks
The D3DHAL_DP2CREATELIGHT structure is used to hold the index into the light array. The driver should enlarge its light array as necessary to accommodate at least as many lights as specified by the index.
