# _D3DHAL_DP2ISSUEQUERY structure
DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.
   

One or more D3DHAL_DP2ISSUEQUERY structures are parsed from the command buffer by the <a href="..\d3dhal\nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> callback when the <a href="..\d3dhal\ns-d3dhal-_d3dhal_dp2command.md">D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND</a> structure's <b>bCommand</b> member is set to D3DDP2OP_ISSUEQUERY, and are used to query for various types of information.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DHAL_DP2ISSUEQUERY {
  DWORD dwQueryID;
  DWORD dwFlags;
} D3DHAL_DP2ISSUEQUERY, *LPD3DHAL_DP2ISSUEQUERY;
````

## Members


`dwFlags`

Specifies the state of the query. This member can contain one or more of the following flags: 

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

<dl>
<dt>D3DISSUE_BEGIN</dt>
<dt>(1 &lt;&lt; 1)</dt>
</dl>


</td>
<td>
Starts building the query. The runtime does not request query data while in this state.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

<dl>
<dt>D3DISSUE_END</dt>
<dt>(1 &lt;&lt; 0)</dt>
</dl>


</td>
<td>
Transitions the state to subsignaled. Results of the query are not available until the state transitions to signaled.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

The driver can ignore query requests with <b>dwFlags</b> set to 0.

`dwQueryID`

Identifies the query for which the driver asynchronously provides information.

## Remarks
The runtime uses D3DHAL_DP2ISSUEQUERY to identify each query that the driver must process. The driver's <a href="..\d3dhal\nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> callback must process <b>wPrimitiveCount</b> D3DHAL_DP2ISSUEQUERY structures from the command buffer. The value of <b>wPrimitiveCount</b> is specified in the D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND structure. The driver parses these structures and retrieves information associated with the queries that they represent.
