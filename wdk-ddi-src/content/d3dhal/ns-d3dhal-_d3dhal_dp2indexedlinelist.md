# _D3DHAL_DP2INDEXEDLINELIST structure
D3DHAL_DP2INDEXEDLINELIST is parsed from the command buffer by the <a href="..\d3dhal\nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> callback when the <a href="..\d3dhal\ns-d3dhal-_d3dhal_dp2command.md">D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND</a> structure's <b>bCommand</b> member is set to D3DDP2OP_INDEXEDLINELIST, and is used to render the lines using vertex indices.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DHAL_DP2INDEXEDLINELIST {
  WORD wV1;
  WORD wV2;
} D3DHAL_DP2INDEXEDLINELIST, *LPD3DHAL_DP2INDEXEDLINELIST;
````

## Members


`wV1`

Specifies the index into the vertex buffer, identifying the first endpoint of the line.

`wV2`

Specifies the index into the vertex buffer, identifying the second endpoint of the line.

## Remarks
<a href="..\d3dhal\nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> should process (<b>wPrimitiveCount</b> * 2) indexes from the command buffer, in effect processing <b>wPrimitiveCount</b> D3DHAL_DP2INDEXEDLINELIST structures. The value of <b>wPrimitiveCount</b> is specified in the D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND structure.

The driver should process a total of (<b>wPrimitiveCount</b> * 2) vertices from the vertex buffer, two vertices per line. The sequence of lines rendered is (<b>wV1</b>₀, <b>wV2</b>₀), (<b>wV1</b>₁, <b>wV2</b>₁), ..., (<b>wV1</b>ₙ,<b>wV2</b>ₙ), where n equals (<b>wPrimitiveCount</b>- 1). The driver should interpret the vertex buffer indexes based on the current command as follows:
<ul>
<li>
When the command is D3DDP2OP_INDEXEDLINELIST, the vertex buffer indexes are relative to the vertex buffer offset specified by the <b>dwVertexOffset</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dhal\ns-d3dhal-_d3dhal_drawprimitives2data.md">D3DHAL_DRAWPRIMITIVES2DATA</a> structure.

</li>
<li>
When the command is D3DDP2OP_INDEXEDLINELIST2, a <a href="..\d3dhal\ns-d3dhal-_d3dhal_dp2startvertex.md">D3DHAL_DP2STARTVERTEX</a> structure immediately follows it and precedes the D3DHAL_DP2INDEXEDLINELIST structure(s) in the command buffer. The vertex buffer indexes are relative to the vertex buffer offset specified by <b>dwVertexOffset</b> plus the base offset obtained from the <b>wVStart</b> member of the D3DHAL_DP2STARTVERTEX structure.

</li>
</ul>The following figure shows a portion of a sample command buffer containing a D3DDP2OP_INDEXEDLINELIST command and two D3DHAL_DP2INDEXEDLINELIST structures. The driver should draw two lines using the following four vertices from the vertex buffer: (v[0], v[4]), (v[5], v[6]).

The driver should process four vertices from the vertex buffer, rendering two lines defined by (v[3], v[7]), (v[8], v[9]).
