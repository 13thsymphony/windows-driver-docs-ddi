### -field D3DDP2OP_SETSCISSORRECT


### -field 
      DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.

### -field Specifies to mark a portion of a 2D resource such as a 2D texture or cube texture. This 2D texture is specified by a D3DHAL_DP2SETSCISSORRECT structure, which is defined as a RECT structure. For more information about RECT, see the DirectX SDK documentation.


### -field D3DDP2OP_SETSTREAMSOURCE2


### -field 
      DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.

### -field Binds a portion of a vertex stream source to a vertex buffer. See D3DHAL_DP2SETSTREAMSOURCE2.


### -field D3DDP2OP_BLT


### -field 
      DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.

### -field Specifies a blt operation from a source surface to a destination surface. It is specified by one or more D3DHAL_DP2BLT structures.


### -field D3DDP2OP_COLORFILL


### -field 
      DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.

### -field Specifies a color-fill operation. See D3DHAL_DP2COLORFILL.


### -field D3DDP2OP_SETVERTEXSHADERCONSTB


### -field 
      DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.

### -field This token is passed to the driver to set one or more vertex shader constant registers with Boolean values. The constant registers are specified by a D3DHAL_DP2SETVERTEXSHADERCONST structure. An array of one or more Boolean values immediately follow the D3DHAL_DP2SETVERTEXSHADERCONST data structure in the DP2 stream. 


### -field D3DDP2OP_CREATEQUERY


### -field 
      DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.

### -field This token is sent to the driver to create driver-side resources for queries that the runtime subsequently issues for processing. The queries are specified by one or more D3DHAL_DP2CREATEQUERY structures. Before the runtime can request to create queries, the runtime must first send D3DGDI2_TYPE_GETD3DQUERYCOUNT and D3DGDI2_TYPE_GETD3DQUERYGetDriverInfo2 requests to determine if the driver supports any query types. For more information about GetDriverInfo2, see Supporting GetDriverInfo2.


### -field D3DDP2OP_SETRENDERTARGET2


### -field 
      DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.

### -field Sets a portion of the render target. See D3DHAL_DP2SETRENDERTARGET2.


### -field D3DDP2OP_SETDEPTHSTENCIL


### -field 
      DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.

### -field Sets a new depth buffer in the driver's current context. See the D3DHAL_DP2SETDEPTHSTENCIL structure.


### -field D3DDP2OP_RESPONSECONTINUE


### -field 
      DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.

### -field This token is returned by the driver in a response buffer and indicates that the driver was unable to write all the responses in the command buffer that the runtime supplied because the size of the buffer was too small. The driver writes as many responses as possible and uses the D3DDP2OP_RESPONSEQUERY token to indicate the presence of these responses. As a result of the D3DDP2OP_RESPONSECONTINUE token, the runtime subsequently resubmits an empty command buffer so that the driver can continue to write more responses.


### -field D3DDP2OP_RESPONSEQUERY


### -field 
      DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.

### -field This token is returned by the driver in a response buffer and indicates the presence of query data in the response buffer. The driver specifies one or more D3DHAL_DP2RESPONSEQUERY structures that identify previously issued queries and specify the size of the data related to the queries. Each D3DHAL_DP2RESPONSEQUERY is followed by its query data. 


### -field D3DDP2OP_GENERATEMIPSUBLEVELS


### -field 
      DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.

### -field Notifies the driver to automatically regenerate the sublevels of a mipmap texture using a specific filter type. This notification is specified with a D3DHAL_DP2GENERATEMIPSUBLEVELS structure. The driver receives this notification after performing some other operation that only accesses the top level of the mipmap texture. For example, a blit operation.


### -field D3DDP2OP_DELETEQUERY


### -field 
      DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.

### -field This token is sent to the driver to notify the driver of the deletion of queries and to give the driver an opportunity to clean up any driver-side resources associated with those queries. This notification is specified by one or more D3DHAL_DP2DELETEQUERY structures. 


### -field D3DDP2OP_ISSUEQUERY


### -field 
      DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.

### -field This token requests that the driver process previously created queries. This request is specified by one or more D3DHAL_DP2ISSUEQUERY structures.


### -field D3DDP2OP_SETPIXELSHADERCONSTI


### -field 
      DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.

### -field This token is passed to the driver to set one or more pixel shader constant registers with integer values. The constant registers are specified by a D3DHAL_DP2SETPIXELSHADERCONST structure. One or more vectors of four integer values immediately follow the D3DHAL_DP2SETPIXELSHADERCONST data structure in the DP2 stream. 


### -field D3DDP2OP_SETPIXELSHADERCONSTB


### -field 
      DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.

### -field This token is passed to the driver to set one or more pixel shader constant registers with Boolean values. The constant registers are specified by a D3DHAL_DP2SETPIXELSHADERCONST structure. An array of one or more Boolean values immediately follow the D3DHAL_DP2SETPIXELSHADERCONST data structure in the DP2 stream. 


### -field D3DDP2OP_SETSTREAMSOURCEFREQ


### -field 
      DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.

### -field Sets the frequency divisor of a stream source that is bound to a vertex buffer. See D3DHAL_DP2SETSTREAMSOURCEFREQ.


### -field D3DDP2OP_SURFACEBLT


### -field 
      DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.

### -field Specifies a blt operation from a source system memory surface to a destination video memory surface. It is specified by one or more D3DHAL_DP2SURFACEBLT structures.


### -field D3DDP2OP_SETCONVOLUTIONKERNELMONO


### -field 
      DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.

### -field Defines the resolution and weights of the kernel filter. See the D3DHAL_DP2SETCONVOLUTIONKERNELMONO structure.


### -field D3DDP2OP_COMPOSERECTS


### -field 
      DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.

### -field Composes two-dimensional areas from a source surface to a destination surface. See the D3DHAL_DP2COMPOSERECTS structure.


## -remarks
Note that because the D3DNTDP2OP_<i>XXX</i> enumerators are type defined as D3DDP2OP_<i>XXX</i> internally in the <i>Dx95type.h</i> file of the Windows Driver Kit (WDK), the shorter form is used here for clarity. Either form is valid on Windows 2000 and later implementations, but only the shorter form can be used on Windows 98/Me.
