# _D3DHAL_DP2TEXTURESTAGESTATE structure
One or more D3DHAL_DP2TEXTURESTAGESTATE structures are parsed from the command buffer by the <a href="..\d3dhal\nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> callback when the <a href="..\d3dhal\ns-d3dhal-_d3dhal_dp2command.md">D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND</a> structure's <b>bCommand</b> member is set to D3DDP2OP_TEXTURESTAGESTATE, and are used to set the appropriate texture stage state.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DHAL_DP2TEXTURESTAGESTATE {
  WORD  wStage;
  WORD  TSState;
  DWORD dwValue;
} D3DHAL_DP2TEXTURESTAGESTATE, *LPD3DHAL_DP2TEXTURESTAGESTATE;
````

## Members


`dwValue`

Specifies the value that the driver should update the texture state identified by <b>TSState</b> to.

`TSState`

Specifies a D3DTEXTURESTAGESTATETYPE enumerated value that specifies the texture state to be updated. DirectX 9.0 and later applications can use values in the D3DSAMPLERSTATETYPE enumeration to control the characteristics of sampler texture-related render states. In DirectX 8.0 and earlier, these sampler states were included in the D3DTEXTURESTAGESTATETYPE enumeration. The runtime maps user-mode sampler states (D3DSAMP_<i>Xxx</i>) to kernel-mode D3DTSS_<i>Xxx</i> values so that drivers are not required to process user-mode sampler states. For more information about D3DTEXTURESTAGESTATETYPE and D3DSAMPLERSTATETYPE, see the DirectX SDK documentation.

`wStage`

Identifies the texture stage where to update the texture state. This member can be an integer in the range 0 through 7, with the highest numbered texture being closest to the frame buffer.

## Remarks
<a href="..\d3dhal\nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> should process <b>wStateCount</b> D3DHAL_DP2TEXTURESTAGESTATE structures from the command buffer. The value of <b>wStateCount</b> is specified in the D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND structure.

For each D3DHAL_DP2TEXTURESTAGESTATE structure, <a href="..\d3dhal\nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> should update the driver's internal texture state associated with the texture at <b>dwStage</b> to reflect the new value based on <b>TSState</b>.

Drivers that do not support multitexturing should implement support for texture stage 0 only.

The following figure shows a portion of a sample command buffer containing a D3DDP2OP_TEXTURESTAGESTATE command and three D3DHAL_DP2TEXTURESTAGESTATE structures. The driver should update stages zero and three of its private texture stage state accordingly.
