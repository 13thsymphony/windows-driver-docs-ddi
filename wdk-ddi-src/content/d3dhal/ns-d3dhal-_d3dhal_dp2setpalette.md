# _D3DHAL_DP2SETPALETTE structure
The D3DHAL_DP2SETPALETTE structure is used to associate a palette with a texture when a driver responds to D3DDP2OP_SETPALETTE in <a href="..\d3dhal\nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a>. This opcode is used to map an association between a palette handle and a surface handle, and specify the characteristics of the palette.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DHAL_DP2SETPALETTE {
  DWORD dwPaletteHandle;
  DWORD dwPaletteFlags;
  DWORD dwSurfaceHandle;
} D3DHAL_DP2SETPALETTE, *LPD3DHAL_DP2SETPALETTE;
````

`dwPaletteHandle`

Specifies a handle to the palette to be set up. If the value is zero, the surface specified by <b>dwSurfaceHandle</b> should be uncoupled from any palette it might have been associated with previously.

`dwSurfaceHandle`

Specifies a handle to the Direct3D surface (texture) that this palette (identified by <b>dwPaletteHandle</b>) is associated to.

## Remarks
The number of D3DHAL_DP2SETPALETTE structures to follow is specified by the <b>wStateCount</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dhal\ns-d3dhal-_d3dhal_dp2command.md">D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND</a> structure that precedes them in the command stream.
