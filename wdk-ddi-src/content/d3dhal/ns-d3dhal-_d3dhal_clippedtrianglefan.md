# _D3DHAL_CLIPPEDTRIANGLEFAN structure
DirectX 8.0 and later versions only.
   

One or more D3DHAL_CLIPPEDTRIANGLEFAN structures are parsed from the command buffer by the <a href="..\d3dhal\nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> callback when the <a href="..\d3dhal\ns-d3dhal-_d3dhal_dp2command.md">D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND</a> structure's <b>bCommand</b> member is set to D3DDP2OP_CLIPPEDTRIANGLEFAN, and are used to render clipped triangle fans.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DHAL_CLIPPEDTRIANGLEFAN {
  DWORD FirstVertexOffset;
  DWORD dwEdgeFlags;
  DWORD PrimitiveCount;
} D3DHAL_CLIPPEDTRIANGLEFAN, *LPD3DHAL_CLIPPEDTRIANGLEFAN;
````

## Members


`dwEdgeFlags`

Specifies a bitmask that identifies what edges are to be drawn when rendering wire frame (to prevent the drawing of edges introduced by clipping). For more information about this bitmask, see the Remarks section of the <a href="..\d3dhal\ns-d3dhal-_d3dhal_dp2trianglefan_imm.md">D3DHAL_DP2TRIANGLEFAN_IMM</a> structure.

`FirstVertexOffset`

Specifies the byte offset into stream 0 of the start of the vertex data (not the index of the vertex).

`PrimitiveCount`

Specifies the number of triangles in the given triangle fan.
