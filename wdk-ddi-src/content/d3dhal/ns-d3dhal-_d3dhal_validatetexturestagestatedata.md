# _D3DHAL_VALIDATETEXTURESTAGESTATEDATA structure
The D3DHAL_VALIDATETEXTURESTAGESTATEDATA structure contains the information required for the driver to determine and return its ability to support multitexturing using the current state.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DHAL_VALIDATETEXTURESTAGESTATEDATA {
  ULONG_PTR dwhContext;
  DWORD     dwFlags;
  ULONG_PTR dwReserved;
  DWORD     dwNumPasses;
  HRESULT   ddrval;
} D3DHAL_VALIDATETEXTURESTAGESTATEDATA, *LPD3DHAL_VALIDATETEXTURESTAGESTATEDATA;
````

## Members


`ddrval`

Specifies the location where the driver writes the return value of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549064">D3dValidateTextureStageState</a> function. A return code of D3D_OK indicates success. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/033beb6e-5872-4cb3-8f39-459e2fff82cd">Return Codes for Direct3D Driver Callbacks</a>.

`dwFlags`

Currently set to zero and should be ignored by the driver.

`dwhContext`

Specifies the context ID of the Direct3D device.

`dwNumPasses`

Specifies the location where the driver should write the number of passes required by the hardware to perform the blending operations.

`dwReserved`

Reserved for system use and should be ignored by the driver.
