# _D3DHAL_DP2DRAWPRIMITIVE2 structure



## -description

   DirectX 8.0 and later versions only.
   
D3DHAL_DRAWPRIMITIVE2 is parsed from the command buffer by the <a href="..\d3dhal\nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> callback when the <a href="display.d3dhal_dp2command">D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND</a> structure's <b>bCommand</b> member is set to D3DDP2OP_DRAWPRIMITIVE2, and is used to render a primitive.


## -syntax

````
typedef struct _D3DHAL_DP2DRAWPRIMITIVE2 {
  D3DPRIMITIVETYPE primType;
  DWORD            FirstVertexOffset;
  DWORD            PrimitiveCount;
} D3DHAL_DP2DRAWPRIMITIVE2, *LPD3DHAL_DP2DRAWPRIMITIVE2;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field primType

Specifies the type of primitive to draw (one of D3DPT_POINTLIST, D3DPT_LINELIST, D3DPT_LINESTRIP, D3DPT_TRIANGLELIST, D3DPT_TRIANGLESTRIP or D3DPT_TRIANGLEFAN).

### -field FirstVertexOffset

Specifies the offset, in bytes, in stream zero of the vertex data. This is in contrast to D3DDP2OP_DRAWPRIMITIVE where the start of the vertex data in the vertex stream is specified by a vertex index rather than an actual byte offset.

### -field PrimitiveCount

Specifies the number of triangles, lines or points to draw for the given primitive.

## -remarks
The vertex data has been transformed by the runtime.
