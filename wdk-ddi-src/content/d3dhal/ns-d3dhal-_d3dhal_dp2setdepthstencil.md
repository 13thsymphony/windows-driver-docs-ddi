# _D3DHAL_DP2SETDEPTHSTENCIL structure



## -description

   DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.
   

The D3DHAL_DP2SETDEPTHSTENCIL structure is used to map a new depth buffer in the driver's current context when the D3DDP2OP_SETDEPTHSTENCIL operation code is received by <a href="..\d3dhal\nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a>.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _D3DHAL_DP2SETDEPTHSTENCIL {
  DWORD hZBuffer;
} D3DHAL_DP2SETDEPTHSTENCIL, *LPD3DHAL_DP2SETDEPTHSTENCIL;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field hZBuffer

Specifies a handle to the depth buffer.


## -remarks
The driver should store the depth buffer identified by <b>hZBuffer</b> in the driver's context when the runtime sends a D3DDP2OP_SETDEPTHSTENCIL operation code in the <a href="..\d3dhal\nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> command stream.
