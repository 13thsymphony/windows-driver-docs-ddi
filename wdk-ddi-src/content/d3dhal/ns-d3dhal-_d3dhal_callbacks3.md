# _D3DHAL_CALLBACKS3 structure



## -description
D3DHAL_CALLBACKS3 is one of several callback structures that describe the Direct3D support provided by the driver.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _D3DHAL_CALLBACKS3 {
  DWORD                                dwSize;
  DWORD                                dwFlags;
  LPD3DHAL_CLEAR2CB                    Clear2;
  LPVOID                               lpvReserved;
  LPD3DHAL_VALIDATETEXTURESTAGESTATECB ValidateTextureStageState;
  LPD3DHAL_DRAWPRIMITIVES2CB           DrawPrimitives2;
} D3DHAL_CALLBACKS3, *LPD3DHAL_CALLBACKS3;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field dwSize

Specifies the size in bytes of this structure.


### -field dwFlags

Indicates the callbacks associated with this structure that the driver has implemented. For every bit the driver sets in <b>dwFlags</b>, the driver must initialize the corresponding function pointer member of this structure. This member can be the bitwise-OR of one or more of the following flags:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DHAL3_CB32_CLEAR2

</td>
<td>
Not used in DirectX 7.0 and later versions.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DHAL3_CB32_DRAWPRIMITIVES2

</td>
<td>
The <b>DrawPrimitives2</b> member points to a driver-implemented <a href="..\d3dhal\nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> callback.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DHAL3_CB32_RESERVED

</td>
<td>
Not used in DirectX 7.0 and later versions.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DHAL3_CB32_VALIDATETEXTURESTAGESTATE

</td>
<td>
The <b>ValidateTextureStageState</b> member points to a driver-implemented <a href="display.d3dvalidatetexturestagestate">D3dValidateTextureStageState</a> callback.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -field Clear2

Must be set to <b>NULL</b>. This was a pointer to the driver-supplied <b>D3dClear2</b> callback that is no longer used for DirectX 7.0 and beyond. Instead the driver should respond to the D3DDP2OP_CLEAR command stream token in its implementation of <a href="..\d3dhal\nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a>.


### -field lpvReserved

Specifies a reserved field and must be set to <b>NULL</b> in a Windows 2000 and later driver.


### -field ValidateTextureStageState

Points to the driver-supplied <a href="display.d3dvalidatetexturestagestate">D3dValidateTextureStageState</a> callback, or <b>NULL</b>. Drivers that support multitexturing must implement the callback that this member points to.


### -field DrawPrimitives2

Points to the driver-supplied <a href="..\d3dhal\nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> callback. A driver must implement the callback that this member points to.


## -remarks
The driver allocates this structure and sets appropriate values in all members. The driver's <a href="display.ddgetdriverinfo">DdGetDriverInfo</a> function returns a pointer to this structure when that function is called with the GUID_D3DCallbacks3 GUID.
