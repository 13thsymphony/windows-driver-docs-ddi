# _D3DHAL_DP2SETINDICES structure
DirectX 8.0 and later versions only.
   

The D3DHAL_DP2SETINDICES structure is used to set the current index buffer for <a href="..\d3dhal\nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a>.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DHAL_DP2SETINDICES {
  DWORD dwVBHandle;
  DWORD dwStride;
} D3DHAL_DP2SETINDICES, *LPD3DHAL_DP2SETINDICES;
````

## Members


`dwStride`

Specifies the size of the indices contained in the index buffer and has the value 2 if the indices are 16-bit, or 4 if the indices are 32-bit quantities.

`dwVBHandle`

Specifies the surface handle associated with this surface through a call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/dd07e49c-ec1f-4ba6-8b17-80ce6d3c5813">D3dCreateSurfaceEx</a>.

## Remarks
A handle value of zero is valid and indicates that the current index buffer is cleared. Subsequent attempts to draw indexed primitives (before a new current index buffer is established via another D3DDP2OP_SETINDICES token) should be handled by the driver such that a crash does not occur. The debug version of your driver should display informative messages to the debug output stream when this error condition is detected.
