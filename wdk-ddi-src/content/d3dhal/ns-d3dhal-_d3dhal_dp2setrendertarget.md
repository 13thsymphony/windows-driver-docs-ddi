# _D3DHAL_DP2SETRENDERTARGET structure
The D3DHAL_DP2SETRENDERTARGET structure is used with the D3DDP2OP_SETRENDERTARGET opcode to map a new rendering target surface and depth buffer in the current context.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DHAL_DP2SETRENDERTARGET {
  DWORD hRenderTarget;
  DWORD hZBuffer;
} D3DHAL_DP2SETRENDERTARGET, *LPD3DHAL_DP2SETRENDERTARGET;
````

## Members


`hRenderTarget`

Specifies a handle to the rendering target.

`hZBuffer`

Specifies a handle to the depth buffer.

## Remarks
The driver should carry out the following tasks in response to a D3DDP2OP_SETRENDERTARGET opcode in the <a href="..\d3dhal\nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> command stream:
<ol>
<li>
Store the rendering target identified by <b>hRenderTarget</b> in the driver's context. 

</li>
<li>
Store the depth buffer identified by <b>hZBuffer</b> in the driver's context. 

</li>
</ol>See the <i>p3samp</i> sample driver that ships with the Microsoft Windows Driver Development Kit (DDK) for more implementation details.
