# _D3DHAL_DP2SETTEXLOD structure
The D3DHAL_DP2SETTEXLOD structure is used to set the level of detail (LOD) for MIP maps when the D3DDP2OP_SETTEXLOD command is sent to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6128ff7a-0d2c-48df-8b5e-cab33c5a74f5">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a>.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct _D3DHAL_DP2SETTEXLOD {
  DWORD dwDDSurface;
  DWORD dwLOD;
} D3DHAL_DP2SETTEXLOD;
```

## Members


`dwDDSurface`

Specifies a handle to a surface chain.

`dwLOD`

Controls the maximum MIP level loaded into video memory. Therefore, if the most detailed MIP map in the chain has dimensions 256x256, setting the maximum level to 2 means that the largest MIP map ever present in video memory has dimensions 64x64.

## Remarks
Used only for driver-managed textures. This structure contains a surface handle to the MIP map and the maximum level of detail to set.
