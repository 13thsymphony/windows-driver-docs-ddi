# _DD_GETD3DQUERYDATA structure
DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.
   

DD_GETD3DQUERYDATA is the data structure pointed to by the <b>lpvData</b> field of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551550">DD_GETDRIVERINFODATA</a> for DD_GETDRIVERINFO2DATA queries with the type D3DGDI2_TYPE_GETD3DQUERY.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DD_GETD3DQUERYDATA {
  DD_GETDRIVERINFO2DATA gdi2;
  union {
    DWORD        dwQueryIndex;
    D3DQUERYTYPE QueryType;
  };
} DD_GETD3DQUERYDATA;
````

## Members


`gdi2`

Specifies a <a href="..\d3dhal\ns-d3dhal-_dd_getdriverinfo2data.md">DD_GETDRIVERINFO2DATA</a> structure that contains the <b>GetDriverInfo2</b> data.

## Remarks
The runtime identifies the query type to be returned with an integer index whose value varies between zero and one less than the number of supported query types that were reported earlier by the driver in a D3DGDI2_TYPE_GETD3DQUERYCOUNT query. How these indices are mapped to actual query types is left to the driver. However, each index must map uniquely to one supported query type. The order in which the query types are reported is not significant. 

When processing this <b>GetDriverInfo2</b> request the driver should read the value in the union as if it were the <b>dwQueryIndex</b> member and map that value to one of the supported query types (probably by using the value in <b>dwQueryIndex</b> as an index into an array of D3DQUERYTYPE values). The driver should then copy that query type into the union as if it were the <b>QueryType</b> member. The runtime guarantees that it only passes an index to the driver that is in the range zero to one less than the number of query types reported by the driver. The range of the index should be validated in the debug driver build.

For more information about D3DQUERYTYPE, see the DirectX SDK documentation.
