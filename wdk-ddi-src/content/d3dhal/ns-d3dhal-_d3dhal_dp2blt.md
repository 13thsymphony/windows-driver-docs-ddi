# _D3DHAL_DP2BLT structure
DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.
   

D3DHAL_DP2BLT is used for two dimensional surface blts when <a href="..\d3dhal\nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> responds to the D3DDP2OP_BLT command token.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DHAL_DP2BLT {
  DWORD dwSource;
  RECTL rSource;
  DWORD dwSourceMipLevel;
  DWORD dwDest;
  RECTL rDest;
  DWORD dwDestMipLevel;
  DWORD Flags;
} D3DHAL_DP2BLT, *LPD3DHAL_DP2BLT;
````

## Members


`dwDest`

Specifies the handle to the destination surface.

`dwDestMipLevel`

Specifies the sublevel of a MIP-map texture that is the destination for the blt.

`dwSource`

Specifies the handle to the source surface.

`dwSourceMipLevel`

Specifies the sublevel of a MIP-map texture that is the source of the blt.

`Flags`

Specifies a flag that indicates the type of filtering that the driver must perform. This member is set to zero to indicate that the driver can use its own filtering technique or is set to one of the following flags.
<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DP2BLT_LINEAR

</td>
<td>
Set for linear filtering.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
DP2BLT_POINT

</td>
<td>
Set for point filtering.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`rDest`

Specifies a RECTL structure that specifies the upper left and lower right points of a rectangle on the destination surface. These points define the area in which the blit should occur and its position on the destination surface.

`rSource`

Specifies a RECTL structure that specifies the upper left and lower right points of a rectangle on the source surface. These points define the area of the source blit data and its position on the source surface.

## Remarks
The <b>dwSource</b> or <b>dwDest</b> member specifies the kernel handle to the top-level surface and the <b>dwSourceMipLevel</b> or <b>dwDestMiplevel</b> member specifies the sublevel for the MIP-map chain where the blt occurs.
