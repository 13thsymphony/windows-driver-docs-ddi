# _DD_DXVERSION structure
DirectX 8.0 and later versions only.
   

DD_DXVERSION describes the current DirectX runtime version.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DD_DXVERSION {
  DD_GETDRIVERINFO2DATA gdi2;
  DWORD                 dwDXVersion;
  DWORD                 dwReserved;
} DD_DXVERSION;
````

## Members


`dwDXVersion`

Specifies the version of DirectX. This member is set to DD_RUNTIME_VERSION, which is 0x00000700 for DirectX 7.0 and 0x00000800 for DirectX 8.0.

`dwReserved`

Reserved. Driver should not read or write.

`gdi2`

Specifies a <a href="..\d3dhal\ns-d3dhal-_dd_getdriverinfo2data.md">DD_GETDRIVERINFO2DATA</a> structure that contains the <b>GetDriverInfo2</b> data.

## Remarks
This information is provided to a new driver (one that exposes <b>GetDriverInfo2</b>) for DX7 and DX8 applications.

The runtime provides a pointer to a DD_DXVERSION structure in the <b>lpvData</b> field of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551550">DD_GETDRIVERINFODATA</a> data structure.

The <b>gdi2</b> member of DD_DXVERSION is used by the runtime with type D3DGDI2_TYPE_DXVERSION specified to notify the driver of the current DirectX runtime version being used by the application.
