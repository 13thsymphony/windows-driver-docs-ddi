# _D3DHAL_DP2SETTRANSFORM structure
D3DHAL_DP2SETTRANSFORM structure is used to specify the transform state and matrix for <a href="..\d3dhal\nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a>.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DHAL_DP2SETTRANSFORM {
  D3DTRANSFORMSTATETYPE xfrmType;
  D3DMATRIX             matrix;
} D3DHAL_DP2SETTRANSFORM, *LPD3DHAL_DP2SETTRANSFORM;
````

## Members


`matrix`

Specifies the matrix used to perform the transform.

`xfrmType`

Specifies the type of transform being done.
