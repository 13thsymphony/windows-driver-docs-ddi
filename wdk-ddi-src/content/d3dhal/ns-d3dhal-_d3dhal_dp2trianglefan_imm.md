# _D3DHAL_DP2TRIANGLEFAN_IMM structure
One D3DHAL_DP2TRIANGLEFAN_IMM structure is parsed from the command buffer by the <a href="..\d3dhal\nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> callback when the <a href="..\d3dhal\ns-d3dhal-_d3dhal_dp2command.md">D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND</a> structure's <b>bCommand</b> member is set to D3DDP2OP_TRIANGLEFAN_IMM, and is used to render a triangle fan.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DHAL_DP2TRIANGLEFAN_IMM {
  DWORD dwEdgeFlags;
} D3DHAL_DP2TRIANGLEFAN_IMM, *LPD3DHAL_DP2TRIANGLEFAN_IMM;
````

## Members


`dwEdgeFlags`

Specifies a bitmask that identifies which of the fan's outside edges should be rendered when the fill mode is D3DFILL_WIREFRAME. A set bit indicates that its corresponding edge should be rendered. For more information about this bitmask, see the Remarks section.

## Remarks
One D3DHAL_DP2TRIANGLEFAN_IMM structure immediately follows the D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND structure in the command buffer. The triangle fan's vertex data is DWORD-aligned immediately following the D3DHAL_DP2TRIANGLEFAN_IMM structure in the command buffer.


<a href="..\d3dhal\nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> should process a total of <b>wPrimitiveCount</b>+2 vertices from the command buffer, three vertices per triangle, rendering <b>wPrimitiveCount</b> triangles. The sequence of triangles rendered is (<b>V[</b>1<b>]</b>, <b>V[</b>2<b>]</b>, <b>V[</b>0<b>]</b>), (<b>V[</b>2<b>]</b>, <b>V[</b>3<b>]</b>, <b>V[</b>0<b>]</b>), (<b>V[</b>3<b>]</b>, <b>V[</b>4<b>]</b>, <b>V[</b>0<b>]</b>), ..., (<b>V[wPrimitiveCount]</b>, <b>V[wPrimitiveCount]</b> + 1<b>]</b>, <b>V[</b>0<b>]</b>). The value of <b>wPrimitiveCount</b> is specified in the D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND structure.

The driver must check the edge flag for each of the fan's outside edges when the fill mode is D3DFILL_WIREFRAME. Starting from the least significant bit of <b>dwEdgeFlags</b>, bit 0 applies to the <b>V[</b>0<b>]</b>-<b>V[</b>1<b>]</b> edge, bit 1 applies to the <b>V[</b>1<b>]</b>-<b>V[</b>2<b>]</b> edge, ..., bit <b>wPrimitiveCount</b> applies to the <b>V[wPrimitiveCount]</b>-<b>V[[wPrimitiveCount]</b>+1<b>]</b> edge, and bit (<b>wPrimitiveCount</b> + 1) applies to the <b>V[[wPrimitiveCount]</b>+1<b>]</b>-<b>V[</b>0<b>]</b> edge.

The following figure shows a portion of a sample command buffer containing a D3DDP2OP_TRIANGLEFAN_IMM command, a D3DHAL_DP2TRIANGLEFAN_IMM structure, and the vertex data. The driver should process the five vertices from the command buffer, rendering a fan with three triangles defined by (v[1], v[2], v[0]), (v[2], v[3], v[0]), (v[3], v[4], v[0]).
