## Syntax
````
struct RILEUTRAMRL {
  DWORD dwParams;
  DWORD dwMobileCountryCode;
  DWORD dwMobileNetworkCode;
  DWORD dwCellID;
  DWORD dwEARFCN;
  DWORD dwPhysCellID;
  DWORD dwTAC;
  DWORD dwRSRP;
  DWORD dwRSRQ;
};
````

## Members


`dwCellID`

Cell identity (28 bits).

`dwEARFCN`

EUTRA absolute radio frequency channel number (0...65535).

`dwMobileCountryCode`

Mobile country code (0...999)

`dwMobileNetworkCode`

Mobile Network Code (0...999)

`dwParams`

A bitwise combination of <a href="..\rilapitypes\ne-rilapitypes-rileutramrlparammask.md">RILEUTRAMRLPARAMMASK</a> enumeration values that indicates which members of the structure contain valid data. A member of the structure is valid if the corresponding bit flag is set.
