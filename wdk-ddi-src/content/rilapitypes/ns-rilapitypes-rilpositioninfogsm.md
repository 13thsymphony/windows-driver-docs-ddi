<div class="alert"><b>Warning</b>  The Cellular COM API is deprecated in Windows 10. This content is provided to support maintenance of OEM and mobile operator created Windows Phone 8.1 applications.</div><div> </div>This structure represents RILPOSITIONINFOGSM.

## Syntax
````
struct RILPOSITIONINFOGSM {
  DWORD dwParams;
  DWORD dwMobileCountryCode;
  DWORD dwMobileNetworkCode;
  DWORD dwLocationAreaCode;
  DWORD dwCellID;
  DWORD dwTimingAdvance;
  DWORD dwARFCN;
  DWORD dwBaseStationID;
  DWORD dwRxLevel;
};
````

## Members


`dwARFCN`

Absolute radio frequency channel number of serving cell (0...1023)

`dwBaseStationID`

Radio base station ID of serving cell (0..63)

`dwCellID`

Cell ID (0...65535)

`dwLocationAreaCode`

Location Area Code (0…65535)

`dwMobileCountryCode`

Mobile country code (0...999)

`dwMobileNetworkCode`

Mobile Network Code (0...999)

`dwParams`

A bitwise combination of <a href="..\rilapitypes\ne-rilapitypes-rilpositioninfogsmparammask.md">RILPOSITIONINFOGSMPARAMMASK</a> enumeration values that indicates which members of the structure contain valid data. A member of the structure is valid if the corresponding bit flag is set.

`dwRxLevel`

Received signal strength of serving cell (0...63) where:

(x=0, RSS &lt; -110dBm

x=63, RSS &gt; -49dBm

0 &lt;x &lt;63, -110+x &lt; RSS &lt; -109+x)

`dwTimingAdvance`

Timing Advance (0...255) in bit periods, where a bit period is 48/13µs
