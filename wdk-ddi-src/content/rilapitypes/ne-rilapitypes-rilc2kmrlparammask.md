## Remarks

Networks will vary, but the following table summarizes which items are returned for typical CDMA networks.

<b>Serving and neighbor networks</b> (subject to availability from network)

Serving

Yes

0 through 1

1 = serving; 0 = non-serving

NID

0 through 32,767

15 bits

SID

0 through 65,535

16 bits

BaseStationID

BaseLat

0 through 4,194,303

Base station latitude in units of 0.25 sec, expressed as a two's-complement signed number with positive numbers signifying north latitudes; 22 bits

BaseLong

0 through 8,388,607

Base station longitude in units of 0.25 sec, expressed as a two's-complement signed number with positive numbers signifying east longitude; 23 bits

RefPN

0 through 511

9 bits

GPSSeconds



CDMA system time from the "sync channel" when this set was acquired

PilotStrength

0 through 63
