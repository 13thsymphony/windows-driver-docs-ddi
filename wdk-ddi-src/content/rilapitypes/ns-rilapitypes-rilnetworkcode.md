# RILNETWORKCODE structure
<div class="alert"><b>Warning</b>  The Cellular COM API is deprecated in Windows 10. This content is provided to support maintenance of OEM and mobile operator created Windows Phone 8.1 applications.</div><div> </div>This structure represents a RILNETWORKCODE.

## Syntax
````
struct RILNETWORKCODE {
  DWORD cbSize;
  DWORD dwParams;
  DWORD dwExecutor;
  DWORD dwMCC;
  DWORD dwMNC;
  DWORD dwSID;
  DWORD dwNID;
  DWORD dwRI;
};
````

## Members


`cbSize`

The size of the structure in bytes.

`dwExecutor`

This field is unused.

`dwMCC`

Mobile Country Code, if applicable. For RIL_SYSTEMTYPE_1XRTT and RIL_SYSTEMTYPE_EVDO it is network-dependent whether this value is available; further, the MCC provided by some 3GPP2 networks may not be accurate.

`dwMNC`

Mobile Network Code. For RIL_SYSTEMTYPE_1XRTT and RIL_SYSTEMTYPE_EVDO it is network-dependent whether this value is available; further, the MCC provided by some 3GPP2 networks may not be accurate.

`dwNID`

Network ID, if applicable. This is available only for RIL_SYSTEMTYPE_1XRTT.

`dwParams`

A bitwise combination of <a href="..\rilapitypes\ne-rilapitypes-rilnetworkcodeparammask.md">RILNETWORKCODEPARAMMASK</a> enumeration values that indicates which members of the structure contain valid data. A member of the structure is valid if the corresponding bit flag is set.

`dwRI`

Roaming indicator, if applicable. This is available only for RIL_SYSTEMTYPE_1XRTT and RIL_SYSTEMTYPE_EVDO.

`dwSID`

System ID, if applicable. This is available only for RIL_SYSTEMTYPE_1XRTT.
