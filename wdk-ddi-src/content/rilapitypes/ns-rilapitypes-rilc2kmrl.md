## -struct-fields

### -field dwParams

A bitwise combination of RILC2KMRLPARAMMASK enumeration values that indicates which members of the structure contain valid data. A member of the structure is valid if the corresponding bit flag is set.


### -field fServing

Indicates whether this is a serving cell. There may be more than one serving cell at a time.


### -field dwNID

Network ID (0...65535).


### -field dwSID

System ID (0...32767).


### -field dwBaseStationID

Base station ID (0...65535).


### -field dwBaseLat

Base station Latitude (0...4194303) encoded in units of 0.25 seconds, expressed in two’s complement representation within the low 22 bits of the DWORD. This is a signed field with North latitudes represented by positive values.


### -field dwBaseLong

Base station Longitude (0...8388607) encoded in units of 0.25 seconds, expressed in two’s complement representation within the low 23 bits of the DWORD. This is a signed field with East longitudes represented by positive values.


### -field dwRefPN

Base station PN number (0...511).


### -field dwGPSSeconds

GPS seconds; the time at which this arrived from the base station.


### -field dwPilotStrength

Signal strength of pilot (0...63).
