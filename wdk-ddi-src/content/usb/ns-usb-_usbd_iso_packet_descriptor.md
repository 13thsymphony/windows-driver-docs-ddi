# _USBD_ISO_PACKET_DESCRIPTOR structure



## -description
The <b>USBD_ISO_PACKET_DESCRIPTOR</b>   structure is used by USB client drivers to describe an isochronous transfer packet.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _USBD_ISO_PACKET_DESCRIPTOR {
  ULONG       Offset;
  ULONG       Length;
  USBD_STATUS Status;
} USBD_ISO_PACKET_DESCRIPTOR, *PUSBD_ISO_PACKET_DESCRIPTOR;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Offset

Specifies the offset, in bytes, of the buffer for this packet from the beginning of the entire isochronous transfer buffer.


### -field Length

 Set by the host controller to indicate the actual number of bytes received from the device for isochronous IN transfers. <b>Length</b> not used for isochronous OUT transfers.


### -field Status

Contains the status, on return from the host controller driver, of this transfer packet.


## -remarks
This structure is used as part of an isochronous transfer request to the host controller driver using the <a href="..\usb\ns-usb-_urb_isoch_transfer.md">_URB_ISOCH_TRANSFER</a> structure. The <b>Offset</b> member contains the offset from the beginning of the <b>TransferBuffer</b> or <b>TransferBufferMDL</b> members of  <b>_URB_ISOCH_TRANSFER</b>.
