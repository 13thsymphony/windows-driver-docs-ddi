# _URB_CONTROL_FEATURE_REQUEST structure
The <b>_URB_CONTROL_FEATURE_REQUEST</b> structure is used by USB client drivers  to set or clear features on a device, interface, or endpoint.

## Syntax
```
struct _URB_CONTROL_FEATURE_REQUEST {
  _URB_HEADER   Hdr;
  struct        _URB_HEADER;
  PVOID         Reserved;
  ULONG         Reserved2;
  ULONG         Reserved3;
  PVOID         Reserved4;
  PMDL          Reserved5;
  _URB          *UrbLink;
  struct        _URB;
  _URB_HCD_AREA hca;
  struct        _URB_HCD_AREA;
  USHORT        Reserved0;
  USHORT        FeatureSelector;
  USHORT        Index;
  USHORT        Reserved1;
};
```

## Members


`Hdr`

Pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540409">_URB_HEADER</a> structure that specifies the URB header information. <b>Hdr.Function</b> indicates either a set or a clear feature operation, to perform on a device, interface, endpoint or other non-standard component. <b>Hdr.Function</b> must have one of the following values:

<b>Hdr.Length</b> must equal <code>sizeof(_URB_CONTROL_FEATURE_REQUEST)</code>.

`Reserved`

Reserved. Do not use.

`Reserved2`

Reserved. Do not use.

`Reserved3`

Reserved. Do not use.

`Reserved4`

Reserved. Do not use.

`Reserved5`

Reserved. Do not use.

`UrbLink`

Reserved. Do not use.

`hca`

Reserved. Do not use.

`Reserved0`

Reserved. Do not use.

`FeatureSelector`

Specifies the USB-defined feature code to be cleared or set. Using a feature code that is invalid, cannot be set, or cannot be cleared will cause the target to stall. The bus driver will copy the value in the <b>FeatureSelector</b> member to the <b>wValue</b> field of the setup packet.

`Index`

Specifies the device-defined index, returned by a successful configuration request, if the request is for an endpoint or interface. Otherwise, <b>Index</b> must be zero. The bus driver will copy the value in the <b>Index</b> member to the <b>wIndex</b> field of the setup packet.

`Reserved1`

Reserved. Do not use.

## Remarks
Drivers can use the <b>UsbBuildFeatureRequest</b> service routine to format this URB. 

The reserved members of this structure must be treated as opaque and are reserved for system use.

When a driver arms a USB device for remote wakeup with an IRP_MN_WAIT_WAKE request, the USB bus driver automatically sets remote wakeup feature on the device. A control feature URB is not necessary.

Likewise, when a driver issues a URB with a function type of URB_FUNCTION_SYNC_RESET_PIPE_AND_CLEAR_STALL to a pipe, the bus driver will automatically clear the pipe's endpoint stall feature. The driver does not have to send a control feature URB to the pipe to clear the endpoint stall.
