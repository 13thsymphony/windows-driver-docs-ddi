# _URB_CONTROL_GET_INTERFACE_REQUEST structure
The <b>_URB_CONTROL_GET_INTERFACE_REQUEST</b> structure is used by USB client drivers to retrieve the current alternate interface setting for an interface in the current configuration.

## Syntax
````
struct _URB_CONTROL_GET_INTERFACE_REQUEST {
  struct URB_HEADER  Hdr;
  PVOID               Reserved;
  ULONG               Reserved0;
  ULONG               TransferBufferLength;
  PVOID               TransferBuffer;
  PMDL                TransferBufferMDL;
  struct URB  *UrbLink;
  struct URB_HCD_AREA  hca;
  UCHAR               Reserved1[4];
  USHORT              Interface;
  USHORT              Reserved2;
};
````

## Members


`_URB`



`hca`

Reserved. Do not use.

`Hdr`

Pointer to a <a href="..\usb\ns-usb-_urb_header.md">_URB_HEADER</a> structure that specifies the URB header information. <b>Hdr.Function</b> must be URB_FUNCTION_GET_INTERFACE, and <b>Hdr.Length</b> must equal <code>sizeof(_URB_CONTROL_GET_INTERFACE_REQUEST)</code>.

`Interface`

Specifies the device-defined index of the interface descriptor being retrieved.

`Reserved`

Reserved. Do not use.

`Reserved0`

Reserved. Do not use.

`Reserved1`

Reserved. Do not use.

`Reserved2`

Reserved. Do not use.

`TransferBuffer`

Pointer to a resident buffer for the transfer or is <b>NULL</b> if an MDL is supplied in <b>TransferBufferMDL</b>. The bus driver returns a single byte specifying the index of the current alternate setting for the interface.

`TransferBufferLength`

Must be 1. This member specifies the length, in bytes, of the buffer specified in <b>TransferBuffer</b> or described in <b>TransferBufferMDL</b>. The host controller driver returns the number of bytes sent to or read from the pipe in this member.

`TransferBufferMDL`

Pointer to an MDL that describes a resident buffer or is <b>NULL</b> if a buffer is supplied in <b>TransferBuffer</b>. The bus driver returns a single byte specifying the index of the current alternate setting for the interface. This MDL must be allocated from nonpaged pool.

`UrbLink`

Reserved. Do not use.

## Remarks
The reserved members of this structure must be treated as opaque and are reserved for system use.
