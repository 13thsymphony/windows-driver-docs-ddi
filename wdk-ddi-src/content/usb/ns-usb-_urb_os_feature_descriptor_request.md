# _URB_OS_FEATURE_DESCRIPTOR_REQUEST structure
The <b>_URB_OS_FEATURE_DESCRIPTOR_REQUEST</b> structure is used by the USB hub driver to retrieve Microsoft OS Feature Descriptors from a USB device or an interface on a USB device.

## Syntax
```
struct _URB_OS_FEATURE_DESCRIPTOR_REQUEST {
  _URB_HEADER   Hdr;
  struct        _URB_HEADER;
  PVOID         Reserved;
  ULONG         Reserved0;
  ULONG         TransferBufferLength;
  PVOID         TransferBuffer;
  PMDL          TransferBufferMDL;
  _URB          *UrbLink;
  struct        _URB;
  _URB_HCD_AREA hca;
  struct        _URB_HCD_AREA;
  UCHAR  : 5    Recipient;
  UCHAR  : 3    Reserved1;
  UCHAR         Reserved2;
  UCHAR         InterfaceNumber;
  UCHAR         MS_PageIndex;
  USHORT        MS_FeatureDescriptorIndex;
  USHORT        Reserved3;
};
```

## Members


`Hdr`

Pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540409">_URB_HEADER</a> structure that specifies the URB header information. <b>Hdr.Function</b> must URB_FUNCTION_GET_MS_FEATURE_DESCRIPTOR.
<b>Hdr.Length</b> must be <code>sizeof(_URB_OS_FEATURE_DESCRIPTOR_REQUEST)</code>.

`Reserved`



`Reserved0`



`TransferBufferLength`

Specifies the length, in bytes, of the buffer specified in <b>TransferBuffer</b> or described in <b>TransferBufferMDL</b>. The host controller driver returns the number of bytes read in this member.  Current implementation of this function limits the maximum MS OS Feature Descriptor size to 4 Kilobytes.

`TransferBuffer`

Pointer to a resident buffer for the transfer or is <b>NULL</b> if an MDL is supplied in <b>TransferBufferMDL</b>.

`TransferBufferMDL`

Pointer to an MDL that describes a resident buffer or is <b>NULL</b> if a buffer is supplied in <b>TransferBuffer</b>. This MDL must be allocated from nonpaged pool.

`UrbLink`

Reserved. Do not use.

`hca`



`Recipient`

Specifies whether the recipient is the USB device or an interface on the USB device.  One of the following values must be specified:

<ul>
<li>0 indicates that the USB device is the recipient of the request.
</li>
<li>1 indicates that a USB interface is the recipient of the request. 
</li>
<li>2 indicates that a USB endpoint is the recipient of the request. 
</li>
</ul>

`Reserved1`



`Reserved2`



`InterfaceNumber`

Indicates the interface number that is the recipient of the request, if the <b>Recipient</b> member value is 1. Must be set to 0 if the USB device is the recipient.

`MS_PageIndex`

Must be set to 0. Page index of the 64K page of the MS OS Feature Descriptor to be returned.  Current implementation only supports a maximum descriptor size of 4K.

`MS_FeatureDescriptorIndex`

Index for MS OS Feature Descriptor to be requested.

`Reserved3`



## Remarks
The reserved members of this structure must be treated as opaque and are reserved for system use.
