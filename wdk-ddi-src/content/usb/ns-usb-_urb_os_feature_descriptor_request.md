# _URB_OS_FEATURE_DESCRIPTOR_REQUEST structure



## -description
The <b>_URB_OS_FEATURE_DESCRIPTOR_REQUEST</b> structure is used by the USB hub driver to retrieve Microsoft OS Feature Descriptors from a USB device or an interface on a USB device.



## -syntax

````
struct _URB_OS_FEATURE_DESCRIPTOR_REQUEST {
  _URB_HEADER  Hdr;
  ULONG       TransferBufferLength;
  PVOID       TransferBuffer;
  PMDL        TransferBufferMDL;
  struct URB  *UrbLink;
  UCHAR       Recipient;
  UCHAR       InterfaceNumber;
  UCHAR       MS_PageIndex;
  USHORT      MS_FeatureDescriptorIndex;
};
````


## -struct-fields

### -field  Hdr

Pointer to a <a href="..\usb\ns-usb-_urb_header.md">_URB_HEADER</a> structure that specifies the URB header information. <b>Hdr.Function</b> must URB_FUNCTION_GET_MS_FEATURE_DESCRIPTOR.
<b>Hdr.Length</b> must be <code>sizeof(_URB_OS_FEATURE_DESCRIPTOR_REQUEST)</code>.



### -field TransferBufferLength

Specifies the length, in bytes, of the buffer specified in <b>TransferBuffer</b> or described in <b>TransferBufferMDL</b>. The host controller driver returns the number of bytes read in this member.  Current implementation of this function limits the maximum MS OS Feature Descriptor size to 4 Kilobytes.


### -field TransferBuffer

Pointer to a resident buffer for the transfer or is <b>NULL</b> if an MDL is supplied in <b>TransferBufferMDL</b>. 


### -field TransferBufferMDL

Pointer to an MDL that describes a resident buffer or is <b>NULL</b> if a buffer is supplied in <b>TransferBuffer</b>. This MDL must be allocated from nonpaged pool.


### -field UrbLink

Reserved. Do not use.


### -field Recipient

Specifies whether the recipient is the USB device or an interface on the USB device.  One of the following values must be specified:

<ul>
<li>0 indicates that the USB device is the recipient of the request.
</li>
<li>1 indicates that a USB interface is the recipient of the request. 
</li>
<li>2 indicates that a USB endpoint is the recipient of the request. 
</li>
</ul>

### -field InterfaceNumber

Indicates the interface number that is the recipient of the request, if the <b>Recipient</b> member value is 1. Must be set to 0 if the USB device is the recipient.


### -field MS_PageIndex

Must be set to 0. Page index of the 64K page of the MS OS Feature Descriptor to be returned.  Current implementation only supports a maximum descriptor size of 4K.


### -field MS_FeatureDescriptorIndex

Index for MS OS Feature Descriptor to be requested.


## -remarks
The reserved members of this structure must be treated as opaque and are reserved for system use.
