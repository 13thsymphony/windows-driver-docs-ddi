# _USBD_INTERFACE_INFORMATION structure
The <b>USBD_INTERFACE_INFORMATION</b> structure holds information about an interface for a configuration on a USB device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _USBD_INTERFACE_INFORMATION {
  USHORT                Length;
  UCHAR                 InterfaceNumber;
  UCHAR                 AlternateSetting;
  UCHAR                 Class;
  UCHAR                 SubClass;
  UCHAR                 Protocol;
  UCHAR                 Reserved;
  USBD_INTERFACE_HANDLE InterfaceHandle;
  ULONG                 NumberOfPipes;
  USBD_PIPE_INFORMATION Pipes[1];
} USBD_INTERFACE_INFORMATION, *PUSBD_INTERFACE_INFORMATION;
````

## Members


`AlternateSetting`

Specifies a device-defined index identifier that indicates which alternate setting this interface is using, should use, or describes.

`Class`

Contains a USB-assigned identifier that specifies a USB-defined class that this interface conforms to.

`InterfaceHandle`

Contains a host controller driver-defined handle that is used to access this interface. This member should be treated as opaque.

`InterfaceNumber`

Specifies the device-defined index identifier for this interface.

`Length`

Specifies the length, in bytes, of this structure.

`NumberOfPipes`

Specifies the number of pipes (endpoints) in this interface.

`Pipes`

Pointer to the first element in the array of <a href="..\usb\ns-usb-_usbd_pipe_information.md">USBD_PIPE_INFORMATION</a> structures. The length of the array depends on the number of endpoints in the interface descriptor.

`Protocol`

Contains a USB-assigned identifier that specifies a USB-defined protocol that this interface conforms to. This code is specific to the codes in <b>Class</b> and <b>SubClass</b>.

`Reserved`

Reserved.

`SubClass`

Contains a USB-assigned identifier that specifies a USB-defined subclass that this interface conforms to. This code is specific to the code in <b>Class</b>.

## Remarks
Members that are part of this structure, but not described here, should be treated as opaque and considered to be reserved for system use.

The reserved members of this structure must be treated as opaque and are reserved for system use.
