# WdfInterruptReportInactive function



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF only]


   
  The <b>WdfInterruptReportInactive</b> method informs the system that the interrupt is no longer active and the driver is not expecting interrupt requests on the associated lines.



## -syntax

````
void WdfInterruptReportInactive(
  _In_ WDFINTERRUPT Interrupt
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Interrupt [in]

A handle to a framework interrupt object.


## -returns
This method does not return a value.


## -remarks
Only drivers that implement functional state power management call <b>WdfInterruptReportInactive</b>.

When a driver calls <b>WdfInterruptReportInactive</b>, the power management framework (PoFx) can then  perform related power management tasks.

Typically, a driver calls <b>WdfInterruptReportInactive</b> from either its  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh406420">ComponentIdleConditionCallback</a> routine, or from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh450931">ComponentIdleStateCallback</a> when <i>State</i> is greater than zero  (indicating a low-power Fx state).

If your driver calls this method on an operating system earlier than Windows 8, <a href="wdf.using_kmdf_verifier">the framework's verifier</a> reports an error.

The following example shows how a driver might call <b>WdfInterruptReportInactive</b> from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh450931">ComponentIdleStateCallback</a> routine of a KMDF driver. The driver registers a single component by calling <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicewdmassignpowerframeworksettings.md">WdfDeviceWdmAssignPowerFrameworkSettings</a>.
