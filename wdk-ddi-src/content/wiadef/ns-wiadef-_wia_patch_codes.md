````
typedef struct _WIA_PATCH_CODES {
  DWORD                Tag;
  DWORD                Version;
  DWORD                Size;
  DWORD                Count;
  WIA_PATCH_CODES_INFO PatchCodes[1];
} WIA_PATCH_CODES;
````

### -field Version

Must be the value 0x00010000 (Version 1.0).


### -field Size

The complete size of this <b>WIA_PATCH_CODES</b> header structure, in bytes, including the complete size of the <a href="..\wiadef\ns-wiadef-_wia_patch_code_info.md">WIA_PATCH_CODES_INFO</a> list.


### -field Count

Specifies the number of <a href="..\wiadef\ns-wiadef-_wia_patch_code_info.md">WIA_PATCH_CODES_INFO</a> elements in the PatchCodes sequence.


### -field PatchCodes

Placeholder for a sequence of <b>Count</b> contiguous <a href="..\wiadef\ns-wiadef-_wia_patch_code_info.md">WIA_PATCH_CODES_INFO</a> structures.
