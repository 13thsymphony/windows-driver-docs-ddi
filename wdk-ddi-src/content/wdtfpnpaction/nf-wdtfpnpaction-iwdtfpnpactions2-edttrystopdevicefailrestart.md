# EDTTryStopDeviceFailRestart method
Attempts to send an IRP_MN_STOP_DEVICE event to the target device and 
then fail the subsequent device restart.

## Syntax

````
HRESULT EDTTryStopDeviceFailRestart(
  [out, retval] VARIANT_BOOL *pbSuccess
);
````

## Parameters

`pbSuccess`

True if the operation succeeds; otherwise, false.


## Return Value

If this method succeeds, it returns <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">S_OK</b>. Otherwise, it returns an <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">HRESULT</b> error code.

## Remarks

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/8fc225af-09d4-42a0-a862-4af89addd5f8">IWDTFEnhancedDeviceTestSupportAction2::Enable</a>  
method must be called for the target device before calling this method.</div>
<div> </div>
<b>EDTTryStopDeviceFailRestart</b> attempts to trigger a PnP resource 
rebalance (an Query Stop, Stop, Start IRP sequence) in which it fails the IRP_MN_START_DEVICE event 
which follows a successful Query Stop and Stop. The failed Start IRP, in turn, causes the system 
to surprise remove the device (IRP_MN_SURPRISE_REMOVAL).

The Stop IRP is not guaranteed. Other drivers on the stack can fail an 
IRP_MN_QUERY_STOP_DEVICE event which precedes the Stop IRP (resulting in IRP_MN_CANCEL_STOP_DEVICE). 
Also, the system may optimize if it detects that the target device does not use hardware 
resources (e.g. a USB mouse) and send a CancelStop IRP instead.

If your device does not consume hardware resources but you still wish to attempt to test 
how the drivers and applications handle the PnP resource rebalance with a failed start, you can 
instead run the <b>EDTTryStopDeviceFailRestart</b> method on a parent 
device, grandparent, etc., which does consume hardware resources. For example, if your device 
is a USB mouse, you can run this method on the parent USB controller instead.
