# _STORAGE_WRITE_CACHE_PROPERTY structure
The STORAGE_WRITE_CACHE_PROPERTY structure is used with the <a href="..\ntddstor\ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_query_property.md">IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY</a> request to retrieve information about a device's write cache property.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _STORAGE_WRITE_CACHE_PROPERTY {
  ULONG              Version;
  ULONG              Size;
  WRITE_CACHE_TYPE   WriteCacheType;
  WRITE_CACHE_ENABLE WriteCacheEnabled;
  WRITE_CACHE_CHANGE WriteCacheChangeable;
  WRITE_THROUGH      WriteThroughSupported;
  BOOLEAN            FlushCacheSupported;
  BOOLEAN            UserDefinedPowerProtection;
  BOOLEAN            NVCacheEnabled;
} STORAGE_WRITE_CACHE_PROPERTY, *PSTORAGE_WRITE_CACHE_PROPERTY;
````

## Members


`FlushCacheSupported`

A Boolean value that indicates whether the device allows host software to flush the device cache. If <b>TRUE</b>, the device allows host software to flush the device cache. If <b>FALSE</b>, host software cannot flush the device cache.

`NVCacheEnabled`

A Boolean value that indicates whether the device has a battery backup for the write cache. If <b>TRUE</b>, the device has a battery backup for the write cache. If <b>FALSE</b>, the device does not have a battery backup for the writer cache.

`Size`

The size, in bytes, of the STORAGE_WRITE_CACHE_PROPERTY structure.

`UserDefinedPowerProtection`

A Boolean value that indicates whether a user can configure the device's power protection characteristics in the registry. If <b>TRUE</b>, a user can configure the device's power protection characteristics in the registry. If <b>FALSE</b>, the user cannot configure the device's power protection characteristics in the registry.

`Version`

The version number of the write cache property.

`WriteCacheChangeable`

A <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568039">WRITE_CACHE_CHANGE</a>-typed value that indicates whether if the host can change the write cache characteristics.

`WriteCacheEnabled`

A <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568042">WRITE_CACHE_ENABLE</a>-typed value that indicates whether the write cache is enabled.

`WriteCacheType`

A <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568044">WRITE_CACHE_TYPE</a>-typed value that indicates the current write cache type

`WriteThroughSupported`

A <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568047">WRITE_THROUGH</a>-typed value that indicates whether the device supports write-through caching.

## Remarks
All of the parameter values that are described in this topic refer to the output of the <a href="..\ntddstor\ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_query_property.md">IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY</a> request.
