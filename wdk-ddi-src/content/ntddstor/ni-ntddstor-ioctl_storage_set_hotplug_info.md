# IOCTL_STORAGE_SET_HOTPLUG_INFO IOCTL
Sets the hotplug configuration of the specified device. This request takes a <a href="..\ntddstor\ns-ntddstor-_storage_hotplug_info.md">STORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO</a> structure as input. The <b>DeviceHotplug</b> member of the STORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO structure determines what action is taken. If the value of that member is nonzero, the value for the device's removal policy in the registry is set to <b>ExpectSurpriseRemoval</b> and all levels of caching are disabled. If the value of <b>DeviceHotplug</b> is zero, the removal policy is set to <b>ExpectOrderlyRemoval</b>, and caching might be selectively enabled.

### Major Code
[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](xref:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control")

### Input Buffer
The input buffer.

### Input Buffer Length
<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> in the I/O stack location indicates the size, in bytes, of the parameter buffer, which must be greater than or equal to <b>sizeof</b>(STORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO).

### Output Buffer
The driver returns the hotplug configuration data in a STORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO structure in the buffer at <b>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b>.

### Output Buffer Length
The length of a <a href="..\ntddstor\ns-ntddstor-_storage_hotplug_info.md">STORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO</a> structure.

### Input / Output Buffer

### Input / Output Buffer Length

### Status Block
The <b>Status</b> field is set to STATUS_SUCCESS, or possibly to STATUS_INFO_LENGTH_MISMATCH if the input buffer is too small. It is set to STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER_1 if the <b>Size</b> member of STORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO is not the size expected by the class driver for this device. It is set to STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER_2 if the <b>MediaRemoveable</b> member has a value different from that held by the class driver. It is set to STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER_3 if the <b>MediaHotplug</b> member has a value different from that held by the class driver, and it is set to STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER_5 if the <b>WriteCacheEnableOverride</b> member has a value different from that held by the class driver.
