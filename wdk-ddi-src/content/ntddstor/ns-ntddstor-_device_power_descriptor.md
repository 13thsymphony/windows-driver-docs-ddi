# _DEVICE_POWER_DESCRIPTOR structure
Used in conjunction with the 
   <a href="..\ntddstor\ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_query_property.md">IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY</a> control code 
   to describes the power capabilities of a storage device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DEVICE_POWER_DESCRIPTOR {
  ULONG   Version;
  ULONG   Size;
  BOOLEAN DeviceAttentionSupported;
  BOOLEAN AsynchronousNotificationSupported;
  BOOLEAN IdlePowerManagementEnabled;
  BOOLEAN D3ColdEnabled;
  BOOLEAN D3ColdSupported;
  BOOLEAN NoVerifyDuringIdlePower;
  UCHAR   Reserved[2];
  ULONG   IdleTimeoutInMS;
} DEVICE_POWER_DESCRIPTOR, *PDEVICE_POWER_DESCRIPTOR;
````

## Members


`AsynchronousNotificationSupported`

<b>True</b> if the device supports asynchronous notifications, delivered via 
      <b>IOCTL_STORAGE_EVENT_NOTIFICATION</b>. Otherwise, <b>False</b>

`D3ColdEnabled`

<b>True</b> if the device will be powered off when put into the D3 power state. Otherwise, <b>False</b>

`D3ColdSupported`

<b>True</b> if the platform supports <b>D3ColdEnabled</b> for this device. Otherwise, 
      <b>False</b>.

`DeviceAttentionSupported`

<b>True</b> if device attention is supported. Otherwise, <b>False</b>.

`IdlePowerManagementEnabled`

<b>True</b> if the device has been registered for runtime idle power management. Otherwise, <b>False</b>

`IdleTimeoutInMS`

The idle timeout value in milliseconds. This member is ignored unless 
      <b>IdlePowerManagementEnabled</b> is true.

`NoVerifyDuringIdlePower`

<b>True</b> if the device requires no verification during idle power transitions. Otherwise, <b>False</b>

`Reserved`

Reserved.

`Size`

Specifies the total size of the data returned, in bytes. This may include data that follows this 
      structure.

`Version`

Contains the size of this structure, in bytes. The value of this member will change as members are added to 
      the structure.
