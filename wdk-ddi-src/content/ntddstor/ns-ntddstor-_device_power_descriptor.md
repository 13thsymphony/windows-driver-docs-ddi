# _DEVICE_POWER_DESCRIPTOR structure



## -description
Used in conjunction with the 
   <a href="..\ntddstor\ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_query_property.md">IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY</a> control code 
   to describes the power capabilities of a storage device.



## -syntax

````

## -struct-fields

### -field Version

Contains the size of this structure, in bytes. The value of this member will change as members are added to 
      the structure.


### -field Size

Specifies the total size of the data returned, in bytes. This may include data that follows this 
      structure.


### -field DeviceAttentionSupported

<b>True</b> if device attention is supported. Otherwise, <b>False</b>.


### -field AsynchronousNotificationSupported

<b>True</b> if the device supports asynchronous notifications, delivered via 
      <b>IOCTL_STORAGE_EVENT_NOTIFICATION</b>. Otherwise, <b>False</b>


### -field IdlePowerManagementEnabled

<b>True</b> if the device has been registered for runtime idle power management. Otherwise, <b>False</b>


### -field D3ColdEnabled

<b>True</b> if the device will be powered off when put into the D3 power state. Otherwise, <b>False</b>


### -field D3ColdSupported

<b>True</b> if the platform supports <b>D3ColdEnabled</b> for this device. Otherwise, 
      <b>False</b>.


### -field NoVerifyDuringIdlePower

<b>True</b> if the device requires no verification during idle power transitions. Otherwise, <b>False</b>


### -field Reserved

Reserved.


### -field IdleTimeoutInMS

The idle timeout value in milliseconds. This member is ignored unless 
      <b>IdlePowerManagementEnabled</b> is true.
