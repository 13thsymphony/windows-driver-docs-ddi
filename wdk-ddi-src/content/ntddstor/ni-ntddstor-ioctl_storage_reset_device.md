# IOCTL_STORAGE_RESET_DEVICE IOCTL



## -description

If possible, resets a non-SCSI storage device without affecting other devices on the bus. Device reset for SCSI devices is not supported. The caller requires only read access to issue a device reset and, to comply, the device must be capable of responding to I/O requests. If the device reset succeeds, pending I/O requests are canceled.
