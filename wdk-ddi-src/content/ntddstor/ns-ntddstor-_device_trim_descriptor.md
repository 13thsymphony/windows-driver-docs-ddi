# _DEVICE_TRIM_DESCRIPTOR structure
The DEVICE_TRIM_DESCRIPTOR structure is used in conjunction with the <a href="..\ntddstor\ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_query_property.md">IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY</a> request to retrieve the trim descriptor data for a device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DEVICE_TRIM_DESCRIPTOR {
  ULONG   Version;
  ULONG   Size;
  BOOLEAN TrimEnabled;
} DEVICE_TRIM_DESCRIPTOR, *PDEVICE_TRIM_DESCRIPTOR;
````

## Members


`Size`

Specifies the total size of the descriptor, in bytes.

`TrimEnabled`

Specifies whether trim is enabled for the device.

`Version`

Contains the size of the structure DEVICE_TRIM_DESCRIPTOR. The value of this member will change as members are added to the structure.

## Remarks
Storage class drivers issue a device-control request with the I/O control code  <a href="..\ntddstor\ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_query_property.md">IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY</a> to retrieve this structure, which contains trim information for the device. The structure can be retrieved either from the device object for the bus or from an FDO, which forwards the request to the underlying bus.

## Requirements
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows Driver kit version** |  |
| **Minimum KMDF version** |  |
| **Minimum UMDF version** |  |
| **Header** | ntddstor.h (include Ntddstor.h) |
