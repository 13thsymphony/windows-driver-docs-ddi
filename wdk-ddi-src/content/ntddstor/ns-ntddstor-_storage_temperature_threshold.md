# _STORAGE_TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD structure
This structure is used to set the over or under temperature threshold of a storage device (via <a href="..\ntddstor\ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_set_temperature_threshold.md">IOCTL_STORAGE_SET_TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD</a>).

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _STORAGE_TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD {
  ULONG   Version;
  ULONG   Size;
  USHORT  Flags;
  USHORT  Index;
  SHORT   Threshold;
  BOOLEAN OverThreshold;
  UCHAR   Reserved;
} STORAGE_TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD, *PSTORAGE_TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD;
````

## Members


`Flags`

Flags set for this request. The following are valid flags.
<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>STORAGE_PROTOCOL_COMMAND_FLAG_ADAPTER_REQUEST</b></td>
<td>This flag indicates the request to target an adapter instead of device.</td>
</tr>
</table>

`Index`

Identifies the instance of temperature information. Starts from 0. Index 0 may indicate a composite value.

`OverThreshold`

Indicates if the <i>Threshold</i> specifies the over or under temperature threshold. If <b>true</b>, set the <b>OverThreshold</b> temperature value of the device; otherwise, set the <b>UnderThreshold</b> temperature value.

`Reserved`

Reserved for future use.

`Size`

The size of this structure. This should be set to sizeof(<b>STORAGE_TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD</b>).

`Threshold`

A signed value that indicates the temperature of the threshold, in degrees Celsius.

`Version`

The version of the structure.
