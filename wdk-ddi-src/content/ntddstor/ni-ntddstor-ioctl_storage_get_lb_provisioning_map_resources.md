# IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_LB_PROVISIONING_MAP_RESOURCES IOCTL



## -description
The <b>IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_LB_PROVISIONING_MAP_RESOURCES</b> request is sent to the storage class driver to determine available and used mapping resources on a storage device.



## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
None.


### -input-buffer-length
None.


### -output-buffer
The buffer at <i>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</i> contains a <a href="..\ntddstor\ns-ntddstor-_storage_lb_provisioning_map_resources.md">STORAGE_LB_PROVISIONING_MAP_RESOURCES</a> structure.


### -output-buffer-length
<i>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.OutputBufferLength</i> in the I/O stack location of the IRP indicates the size, in bytes, of the buffer, which must be at least <b>sizeof</b>(STORAGE_LB_PROVISIONING_MAP_RESOURCES).


### -in-out-buffer

<text></text>

### -inout-buffer-length

<text></text>

### -status-block
I/O Status block
The <b>Status</b> field can be set to STATUS_SUCCESS, or possibly to STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_REQUEST, STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL, STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW, or some other error status.


## -remarks
If logical block provisioning is enabled on a LUN, resource mapping counts  may be reported from the storage device. Resource mapping information is obtained by using the <b>IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_LB_PROVISIONING_MAP_RESOURCES</b>  request. A storage monitoring application can use this IOCTL to query resource mapping conditions before a resource threshold or exhaustion event is logged.
