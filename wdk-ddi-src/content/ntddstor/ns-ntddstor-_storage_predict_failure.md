# _STORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE structure
The STORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE structure is used in conjunction with <a href="..\ntddstor\ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_predict_failure.md">IOCTL_STORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE</a> to report whether a device is currently predicting a failure.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _STORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE {
  ULONG PredictFailure;
  UCHAR VendorSpecific[512];
} STORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE, *PSTORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE;
````

## Members


`PredictFailure`

Indicates when nonzero that the device is currently predicting an imminent failure.

`VendorSpecific`

Contains an array that holds 512 bytes of vendor-specific information if the device supports failure prediction.

## Remarks
Upon receiving an <a href="..\ntddstor\ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_predict_failure.md">IOCTL_STORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE</a> device control request, the disk class driver attempts to verify if an IDE drive supports SMART. If the drive is a SCSI drive, the class driver attempts to verify if the SCSI disk supports the equivalent IDE SMART technology: Information Exception Control Page, X3T10/94-190 Rev 4. 

If the device does not support failure prediction, the disk class driver fails the IRP with a status of STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_REQUEST.

If the device supports failure prediction, the disk class driver queries the device for failure prediction status. If the device has bad sectors and predicts a failure, the disk class driver returns a nonzero value in <b>PredictFailure</b>. If status indicates that the device does not predict any failures at this time, the disk class driver returns a value of 0 in <b>PredictFailure</b>.
