# _STORAGE_OFFLOAD_TOKEN structure
The <b>STORAGE_OFFLOAD_TOKEN</b> structure contains a token value that serves as a representation of a data set range within a file on a volume. This structure is used in performing offload reads and writes.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _STORAGE_OFFLOAD_TOKEN {
  UCHAR TokenType[4];
  UCHAR Reserved[2];
  UCHAR TokenIdLength[2];
  union {
    struct {
      UCHAR Reserved2[STORAGE_OFFLOAD_TOKEN_ID_LENGTH];
    } StorageOffloadZeroDataToken;
    UCHAR  Token[STORAGE_OFFLOAD_TOKEN_ID_LENGTH];
  };
} STORAGE_OFFLOAD_TOKEN, *PSTORAGE_OFFLOAD_TOKEN;
````

## Members

        
            `Reserved`

            Reserved.
        
            `TokenIdLength`

            The length of the token data in <b>Token</b>.
        
            `TokenType`

            The type of token contained in this structure. <b>TokenType</b> is set to either of the following:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>

    ## Remarks
        The token information contained in <b>STORAGE_OFFLOAD_TOKEN</b> is generated by the offload read/write infrastructure. All members of this structure should be considered as read only and must not be modified by any callers requesting an offload read or an offload write.

## Requirements

| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows Driver kit version** |  |
