# _DEVICE_SEEK_PENALTY_DESCRIPTOR structure
The DEVICE_SEEK_PENALTY_DESCRIPTOR structure is used in conjunction with the <a href="..\ntddstor\ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_query_property.md">IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY</a> request to retrieve the seek penalty descriptor data for a device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DEVICE_SEEK_PENALTY_DESCRIPTOR {
  ULONG   Version;
  ULONG   Size;
  BOOLEAN IncursSeekPenalty;
} DEVICE_SEEK_PENALTY_DESCRIPTOR, *PDEVICE_SEEK_PENALTY_DESCRIPTOR;
````

## Members


`IncursSeekPenalty`

Specifies whether the device incurs a seek penalty.

`Size`

Specifies the total size of the descriptor, in bytes.

`Version`

Contains the size of the structure DEVICE_SEEK_PENALTY_DESCRIPTOR. The value of this member will change as members are added to the structure.

## Remarks
Storage class drivers issue a device-control request with the I/O control code  <a href="..\ntddstor\ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_query_property.md">IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY</a> to retrieve this structure, which contains seek penalty information for data transfer operations. The structure can be retrieved either from the device object for the bus or from an FDO, which forwards the request to the underlying bus.
