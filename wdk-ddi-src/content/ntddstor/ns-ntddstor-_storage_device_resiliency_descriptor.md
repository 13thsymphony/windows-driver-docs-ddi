# _STORAGE_DEVICE_RESILIENCY_DESCRIPTOR structure



## -description
Reserved for system use.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _STORAGE_DEVICE_RESILIENCY_DESCRIPTOR {
  ULONG Version;
  ULONG Size;
  ULONG NameOffset;
  ULONG NumberOfLogicalCopies;
  ULONG NumberOfPhysicalCopies;

## -struct-fields

### -field Version

Contains the size of this structure, in bytes. The value of this member will change as members are added to 
      the structure. Set to 
      <code>sizeof(STORAGE_DEVICE_RESILIENCY_DESCRIPTOR)</code>.


### -field Size

Specifies the total size of the data returned, in bytes. This may include data that follows this 
      structure.


### -field NameOffset

Byte offset to the null-terminated ASCII string containing the resiliency properties Name. For devices with 
      no Name property, this will be zero.


### -field NumberOfLogicalCopies

Number of logical copies of data that are available.


### -field NumberOfPhysicalCopies

Number of complete copies of data that are stored.


### -field PhysicalDiskRedundancy

Number of disks that can fail without leading to data loss.


### -field NumberOfColumns

Number of columns in the storage device.


### -field Interleave

Size of a stripe unit of the storage device, in bytes. This is also referred to as the stripe width or 
      interleave of the storage device.
