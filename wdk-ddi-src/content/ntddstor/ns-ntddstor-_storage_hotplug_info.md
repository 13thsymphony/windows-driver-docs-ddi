# _STORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO structure
The STORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO structure provides hotplug information for a device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _STORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO {
  ULONG   Size;
  BOOLEAN MediaRemovable;
  BOOLEAN MediaHotplug;
  BOOLEAN DeviceHotplug;
  BOOLEAN WriteCacheEnableOverride;
} STORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO, *PSTORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO;
````

## Members


`DeviceHotplug`

Specifies whether the device is a hotplug device. If set to a nonzero value, the device is a hotplug device. If set to zero, the device is not a hotplug device.

`MediaHotplug`

Specifies whether the media is lockable. If set to a nonzero value, the device media is not lockable. If set to zero, the device media is lockable.

`MediaRemovable`

Specifies whether the media is removable. If set to a nonzero value, the device media is removable. If set to zero, the device media is not removable.

`Size`

Indicates the size, in bytes, of this structure.

`WriteCacheEnableOverride`

Do not use; set the value to <b>NULL</b>.

## Remarks
The value of the <b>Size</b> member also identifies the version of this structure. New members will be added to this structure in the future. If the value of the <b>Size</b> member is <b>sizeof</b>(STORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO), the current version of the structure is the same as the version you compiled with. If the value is not <b>sizeof</b>(STORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO), the current version contains additional members.

Microsoft Windows XP includes support for hotplug devices. A hotplug device refers to a device whose <b>RemovalPolicy</b> value displayed in the Device Manager is <b>ExpectSurpriseRemoval</b>. To query whether a particular device is a hotplug device, use the <a href="..\ntddstor\ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_get_hotplug_info.md">IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_HOTPLUG_INFO</a> request. To set the hotplug properties of a device, use the <a href="..\ntddstor\ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_set_hotplug_info.md">IOCTL_STORAGE_SET_HOTPLUG_INFO</a> request.

In the case of the IOCTL_STORAGE_SET_HOTPLUG_INFO request, the <b>DeviceHotplug</b> member of the STORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO structure determines what action is taken. If the value of that member is nonzero, the value for the device's removal policy in the registry is set to <b>ExpectSurpriseRemoval</b> and all levels of caching are disabled. If the value of <b>DeviceHotplug</b> is zero, the removal policy is set to <b>ExpectOrderlyRemoval</b>, and caching may be selectively enabled.
