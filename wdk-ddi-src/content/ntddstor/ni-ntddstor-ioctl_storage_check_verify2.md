# IOCTL_STORAGE_CHECK_VERIFY2 IOCTL



## -description

Determines whether the media has changed on a removable-media device - the caller has opened with FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES. Because no file system is mounted when a device is opened in this way, this request can be processed much more quickly than an IOCTL_STORAGE_CHECK_VERIFY request.
