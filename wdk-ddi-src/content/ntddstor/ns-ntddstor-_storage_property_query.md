# _STORAGE_PROPERTY_QUERY structure
This structure is used in conjunction with <a href="..\ntddstor\ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_query_property.md">IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY</a> to retrieve the properties of a storage device or adapter.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _STORAGE_PROPERTY_QUERY {
  STORAGE_PROPERTY_ID PropertyId;
  STORAGE_QUERY_TYPE  QueryType;
  UCHAR               AdditionalParameters[1];
} STORAGE_PROPERTY_QUERY, *PSTORAGE_PROPERTY_QUERY;
````

## Members


`AdditionalParameters`

Contains an array of bytes with additional input parameters that are needed for the <b>PropertyId</b> query. Not all <b>PropertyId</b> values require additional input parameters.

`PropertyId`

Indicates whether the caller is requesting a device descriptor, an adapter descriptor, a write cache property, a device unique ID (DUID), or the device identifiers provided in the device's SCSI vital product data (VPD) page. For a list of the property IDs that can be assigned to this member, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566996">STORAGE_PROPERTY_ID</a>.

`QueryType`

Contains flags indicating the type of query to be performed. For a list of the various query types that can be assigned to this member, see <a href="..\ntddstor\ne-ntddstor-_storage_query_type.md">STORAGE_QUERY_TYPE</a>.

## Remarks
The results of the query can be one of 
     several structures depending on the value of the <b>PropertyId</b> member. These values are enumerated by the 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566996">STORAGE_PROPERTY_ID</a> enumeration.

If the 
     <b>QueryType</b> member is set to 
     <b>PropertyExistsQuery</b>, then no structure is returned. For more info, see <a href="..\ntddstor\ne-ntddstor-_storage_query_type.md">STORAGE_QUERY_TYPE</a>.
