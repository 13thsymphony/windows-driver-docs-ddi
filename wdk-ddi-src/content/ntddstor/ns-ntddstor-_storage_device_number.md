# _STORAGE_DEVICE_NUMBER structure



## -description
The STORAGE_DEVICE_NUMBER structure is used in conjunction with the <a href="..\ntddstor\ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_get_device_number.md">IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_DEVICE_NUMBER</a> request to retrieve the FILE_DEVICE_<i>XXX</i> device type, the device number, and, for a device that can be partitioned, the partition number assigned to a device by the driver when the device is started. 



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _STORAGE_DEVICE_NUMBER {
  DEVICE_TYPE DeviceType;
  ULONG       DeviceNumber;
  ULONG       PartitionNumber;
} STORAGE_DEVICE_NUMBER, *PSTORAGE_DEVICE_NUMBER;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field DeviceType

Specifies one of the system-defined FILE_DEVICE_<i>XXX</i> constants indicating the type of device (such as FILE_DEVICE_DISK, FILE_DEVICE_KEYBOARD, and so forth) or a vendor-defined value for a new type of device. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563821">Specifying Device Types</a>. 


### -field DeviceNumber

Indicates the number of this device. This value is set to 0xFFFFFFFF (-1) for the disks that represent the physical paths of an MPIO disk.


### -field PartitionNumber

Indicates the partition number of the device is returned in this member, if the device can be partitioned. Otherwise, -1 is returned. 


## -remarks
The <a href="..\ntddstor\ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_get_device_number.md">IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_DEVICE_NUMBER</a> request is usually issued by a fault-tolerant disk driver.

The values in the STORAGE_DEVICE_NUMBER structure are guaranteed to remain unchanged until the system is rebooted. They are not guaranteed to be persistent across boots.
