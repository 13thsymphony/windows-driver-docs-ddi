# IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_PHYSICAL_ELEMENT_STATUS IOCTL



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[Some information relates to pre-released product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.]

The <b>IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_PHYSICAL_ELEMENT_STATUS</b> 
   control code queries for and returns  the physical element status from a device.



## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer

Irp->IoStatus.Status is set to STATUS_SUCCESS if the request is successful.
Otherwise, Status to the appropriate error condition as a NTSTATUS code. 
For more information, see [XREF-LINK:NTSTATUS Values].

## -remarks
To perform this operation, call the <a href="base.deviceiocontrol">DeviceIoControl</a> 
   function with the following parameters.


<pre class="syntax">BOOL 
   WINAPI 
   DeviceIoControl( (HANDLE)       hDevice,         // handle to device
                    (DWORD)        IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_PHYSICAL_ELEMENT_STATUS, // dwIoControlCode
                    (LPDWORD)      lpInBuffer,      // input buffer
                    (DWORD)        nInBufferSize,   // size of input buffer
                    (LPDWORD)      lpOutBuffer,     // output buffer
                    (DWORD)        nOutBufferSize,  // size of output buffer
                    (LPDWORD)      lpBytesReturned, // number of bytes returned
                    (LPOVERLAPPED) lpOverlapped );  // OVERLAPPED structure</pre>




A handle to the device. To obtain a device handle, call the 
      <a href="fs.createfile">CreateFile</a> function.

The control code for the operation. Use 
      <b>IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_PHYSICAL_ELEMENT_STATUS</b> 
      for this operation.

A pointer to an input buffer that receives a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/A0876712-4D9B-4A97-8E94-AA570A71C53D">PHYSICAL_ELEMENT_STATUS_REQUEST</a> structure which defines the starting element to look for the physical element status of a device.

Specifies the size of the input buffer, in bytes.

A pointer to an output buffer that contains a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5E2AB36E-5A5C-4253-9791-A5CC157F15E3">PHYSICAL_ELEMENT_STATUS</a> structure which defines the physical element status from a device.

Specifies the size of the output buffer, in bytes.

<b>LPDWORD</b>

A pointer to a variable that receives the size of the data stored in the output buffer, in bytes.

If the output buffer is too small, the call fails, 
       <a href="base.getlasterror">GetLastError</a> returns 
       <b>ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER</b>, and <i>lpBytesReturned</i> is zero.

If <i>lpOverlapped</i> is <b>NULL</b>, 
       <i>lpBytesReturned</i> cannot be <b>NULL</b>. Even when an operation 
       returns no output data and <i>lpOutBuffer</i> is <b>NULL</b>, 
       <a href="base.deviceiocontrol">DeviceIoControl</a> 
       makes use of <i>lpBytesReturned</i>. After such an operation, the value of 
       <i>lpBytesReturned</i> is meaningless.

If <i>lpOverlapped</i> is not <b>NULL</b>, 
       <i>lpBytesReturned</i> can be <b>NULL</b>. If this parameter is not 
       <b>NULL</b> and the operation returns data, <i>lpBytesReturned</i> is 
       meaningless until the overlapped operation has completed. To retrieve the number of bytes returned, call 
       <a href="base.getoverlappedresult">GetOverlappedResult</a>. If the 
       <i>hDevice</i> parameter is associated with an I/O completion port, you can retrieve the 
       number of bytes returned by calling 
       <a href="fs.getqueuedcompletionstatus">GetQueuedCompletionStatus</a>.

<b>LPOVERLAPPED</b>

A pointer to an <a href="base.overlapped_str">OVERLAPPED</a> structure.

If <i>hDevice</i> was opened without specifying 
       <b>FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED</b>, <i>lpOverlapped</i> is ignored.

If <i>hDevice</i> was opened with the <b>FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED</b> flag, 
       the operation is performed as an overlapped (asynchronous) operation. In this case, 
       <i>lpOverlapped</i> must point to a valid 
       <a href="base.overlapped_str">OVERLAPPED</a> structure that contains a handle to an 
       event object. Otherwise, the function fails in unpredictable ways.

For overlapped operations, <a href="base.deviceiocontrol">DeviceIoControl</a> 
       returns immediately, and the event object is signaled when the operation has been completed. Otherwise, the 
       function does not return until the operation has been completed or an error occurs.

If the operation completes successfully, 
       <a href="base.deviceiocontrol">DeviceIoControl</a> returns a nonzero 
       value.

If the operation fails or is pending, 
       <a href="base.deviceiocontrol">DeviceIoControl</a> returns zero. To get extended error 
       information, call <a href="base.getlasterror">GetLastError</a>.
