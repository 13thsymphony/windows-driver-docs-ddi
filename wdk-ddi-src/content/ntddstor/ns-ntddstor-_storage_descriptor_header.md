# _STORAGE_DESCRIPTOR_HEADER structure
The STORAGE_DESCRIPTOR_HEADER structure is used in conjunction with the <a href="..\ntddstor\ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_query_property.md">IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY</a> request to retrieve the properties of a storage device or adapter.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _STORAGE_DESCRIPTOR_HEADER {
  ULONG Version;
  ULONG Size;
} STORAGE_DESCRIPTOR_HEADER, *PSTORAGE_DESCRIPTOR_HEADER;
````

## Members


`Size`

Indicates the quantity of data reported, in bytes.

`Version`

Contains the version of the data reported.

## Remarks
The data retrieved by IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY is reported in the buffer immediately following this structure. 

The IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY request reports one of three types of properties: a device descriptor, an adapter descriptor, or a set of device IDs taken from the device's SCSI vital product data pages. Device descriptors are reported in a structure of type <a href="..\ntddstor\ns-ntddstor-_storage_device_descriptor.md">STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR</a>. Adapter descriptors are reported in a structure of type <a href="..\ntddstor\ns-ntddstor-_storage_adapter_descriptor.md">STORAGE_ADAPTER_DESCRIPTOR</a>. Vital product page device IDs are reported in a structure of type <a href="..\ntddstor\ns-ntddstor-_storage_device_id_descriptor.md">STORAGE_DEVICE_ID_DESCRIPTOR</a>.
