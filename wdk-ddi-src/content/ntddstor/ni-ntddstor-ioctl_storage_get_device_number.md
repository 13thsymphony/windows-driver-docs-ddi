# IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_DEVICE_NUMBER IOCTL
Returns a <a href="..\ntddstor\ns-ntddstor-_storage_device_number.md">STORAGE_DEVICE_NUMBER</a> structure that contains the FILE_DEVICE_<i>XXX</i> type, device number, and, for a partitionable device, the partition number assigned to a device by the driver when the device is started. This request is usually issued by a fault-tolerant disk driver.

### Major Code
[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](xref:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control")

### Input Buffer
None.

### Input Buffer Length
None.

### Output Buffer
The driver returns the <a href="..\ntddstor\ns-ntddstor-_storage_device_number.md">STORAGE_DEVICE_NUMBER</a> data in the buffer at <b>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b>.

### Output Buffer Length
<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.OutputBufferLength</b> in the I/O stack location indicates the size, in bytes, of the parameter buffer, which must be &gt;= <b>sizeof</b>(STORAGE_DEVICE_NUMBER).

### Input / Output Buffer
<text></text>

### Input / Output Buffer Length
