# _STORAGE_TEMPERATURE_DATA_DESCRIPTOR structure
This structure is used in conjunction with <a href="..\ntddstor\ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_query_property.md">IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY</a> to return temperature data from a storage device or adapter.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _STORAGE_TEMPERATURE_DATA_DESCRIPTOR {
  ULONG                    Version;
  ULONG                    Size;
  SHORT                    CriticalTemperature;
  SHORT                    WarningTemperature;
  USHORT                   InfoCount;
  UCHAR                    Reserved0[2];
  ULONG                    Reserved1[2];
  STORAGE_TEMPERATURE_INFO TemperatureInfo[ANYSIZE_ARRAY];
} STORAGE_TEMPERATURE_DATA_DESCRIPTOR, *PSTORAGE_TEMPERATURE_DATA_DESCRIPTOR;
````

## Members


`CriticalTemperature`

Indicates the minimum temperature in degrees Celsius that may prevent normal operation. Exceeding this temperature may result in possible data loss, automatic device shutdown, extreme performance throttling, or permanent damage.

`InfoCount`

Specifies the number of <a href="..\ntddstor\ns-ntddstor-_storage_temperature_info.md">STORAGE_TEMPERATURE_INFO</a> structures reported in <b>TemperatureInfo</b>. More than one set of temperature data may be returned when there are multiple sensors in the drive.

`Reserved0`

Reserved for future use.

`Reserved1`

Reserved for future use.

`Size`

Specifies the total size of the data returned, in bytes. This may include data that follows this structure.

`TemperatureInfo`



`Version`

Contains the size of this structure, in bytes. The value of this member will change as members are added to the structure.

`WarningTemperature`

Indicates the maximum temperature in degrees Celsius at which the device is capable of operating continuously without degrading operation or reliability.
