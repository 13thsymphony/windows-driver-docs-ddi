# _STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR structure
The <b>STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure 
   is used in conjunction with the 
   <a href="..\ntddstor\ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_query_property.md">IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY</a> request to 
   retrieve the storage device descriptor data for a device.

## Syntax

## Members


`BusType`

Specifies an enumerator value of type 
      <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566356">STORAGE_BUS_TYPE</a> that indicates the type of bus to 
      which the device is connected. This should be used to interpret the raw device properties at the end of this 
      structure (if any).

`CommandQueueing`

Indicates when <b>TRUE</b> that the device supports multiple outstanding commands (SCSI 
      tagged queuing or equivalent). When <b>FALSE</b>, the device does not support SCSI-tagged 
      queuing or the equivalent. The STORPORT driver is responsible for synchronizing the commands.

`DeviceType`

Specifies the device type as defined by the Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) specification.

`DeviceTypeModifier`

Specifies the device type modifier, if any, as defined by the SCSI specification. If no device type 
      modifier exists, this member is zero.

`ProductIdOffset`

Specifies the byte offset from the beginning of the structure to a <b>NULL</b>-terminated ASCII string that 
      contains the device's product ID. If the device has no product ID, this member is zero.

`ProductRevisionOffset`

Specifies the byte offset from the beginning of the structure to a <b>NULL</b>-terminated ASCII string that 
      contains the device's product revision string. If the device has no product revision string, this member is 
      zero.

`RawDeviceProperties`

Contains an array of length one that serves as a place holder for the first byte of the bus specific 
      property data.

`RawPropertiesLength`

Indicates the number of bytes of bus-specific data that have been appended to this descriptor.

`RemovableMedia`

Indicates when <b>TRUE</b> that the device's media (if any) is removable. If the device 
      has no media, this member should be ignored. When <b>FALSE</b> the device's media is not 
      removable.

`SerialNumberOffset`

Specifies the byte offset from the beginning of the structure to a <b>NULL</b>-terminated ASCII string that 
      contains the device's serial number. If the device has no serial number, this member is zero.

`Size`

Specifies the total size of the descriptor in bytes, including ID strings which are appended to the 
      structure.

`VendorIdOffset`

Specifies the byte offset from the beginning of the structure to a <b>NULL</b>-terminated ASCII string that 
      contains the device's vendor ID. If the device has no vendor ID, this member is zero.

`Version`

Indicates the size of the 
      <b>STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure. The 
      value of this member will change as members are added to the structure.

## Remarks
Applications and storage class drivers issue a device-control request with the I/O control code 
     <a href="..\ntddstor\ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_query_property.md">IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY</a> to retrieve 
     this structure, which contains information about a target device. The structure can be retrieved only from an 
     FDO; attempting to retrieve device properties from an adapter causes an error.

An application or driver can determine the required buffer size by casting the retrieved 
     <b>STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure to a 
     <a href="..\ntddstor\ns-ntddstor-_storage_descriptor_header.md">STORAGE_DESCRIPTOR_HEADER</a>, which contains 
     only <b>Version</b> and <b>Size</b>.
