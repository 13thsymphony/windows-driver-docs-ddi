# _STORAGE_DIAGNOSTIC_DATA structure
Describes  diagnostic data about the storage driver stack. The <b>STORAGE_DIAGNOSTIC_DATA</b> structure is provided in the output buffer of an  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5F71CCBE-F93F-4DCD-A673-1D6DE49C7400">IOCTL_STORAGE_DIAGNOSTIC</a> request.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _STORAGE_DIAGNOSTIC_DATA {
  ULONG                          Version;
  ULONG                          Size;
  GUID                           ProviderId;
   ULONG                         BufferSize;
  ULONG                          Reserved;
  _Field_size_(BufferSize) UCHAR DiagnosticDataBuffer[ANYSIZE_ARRAY];
} STORAGE_DIAGNOSTIC_DATA, *PSTORAGE_DIAGNOSTIC_DATA;
````

## Members


`BufferSize`

If the request failed because of buffer too small, this field should be filled with the required buffer
    size for a <i>DiagnosticDataBuffer</i> needed by provider;
     if the request is successful, it should be filled with returned buffer size of <i>DiagnosticDataBuffer</i>;
     it should be cleared to zero for other cases.

`DiagnosticDataBuffer`

Specifies the Diagnostic data buffer.

`ProviderId`

Specifies the GUID of a diagnostic data provider.

`Reserved`

Reserved for future use.
