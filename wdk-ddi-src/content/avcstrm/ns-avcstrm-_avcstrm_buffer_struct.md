## -description
The AVCSTRM_BUFFER_STRUCT structure describes a buffer to be submitted to <i>avcstrm.sys</i> for read or write operations.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _AVCSTRM_BUFFER_STRUCT {
  BOOL             ClockProvider;
  HANDLE           ClockHandle;
  PKSSTREAM_HEADER StreamHeader;
  PVOID            FrameBuffer;
  PVOID            Context;
} AVCSTRM_BUFFER_STRUCT, *PAVCSTRM_BUFFER_STRUCT;

## -struct-fields

### -field ClockProvider

Indicates whether the subunit driver itself serves as a clock provider. This is <b>TRUE</b> if this stream also serves as a clock provider, Otherwise, this is <b>FALSE</b>.


### -field ClockHandle

Specifies a handle to a clock provider other than the subunit driver itself.


### -field StreamHeader

Pointer to a kernel streaming header that describes a packet of data to be read from or written to a streaming driver pin.


### -field FrameBuffer
