# _AVCSTRM_OPEN_STRUCT structure
The AVCSTRM_OPEN_STRUCT structure describes a data stream to be opened.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _AVCSTRM_OPEN_STRUCT {
  KSPIN_DATAFLOW       DataFlow;
  PAVCSTRM_FORMAT_INFO AVCFormatInfo;
  PVOID                AVCStreamContext;
  HANDLE               hPlugLocal;
} AVCSTRM_OPEN_STRUCT, *PAVCSTRM_OPEN_STRUCT;
````

## Members


`AVCFormatInfo`

Pointer to a description of the subunit stream format.

`AVCStreamContext`

Pointer to a stream context (handle) that is passed to subsequent <i>avcstrm.sys</i> operations. Its content should not be used or altered.

`DataFlow`

Specifies the direction of the data-flow.

`hPlugLocal`

Specifies a local plug created by an AV/C subunit, which is used to connect to the target device.

## Remarks
The <b>AVCSTRM_OPEN</b> function code uses this structure to describe the open operation. If the operation is successful, a stream context (handle) is returned to the caller in the <b>AVCStrmContext </b>member of this structure, <i>not</i> the <b>AVCStrmContext</b> member in the AVC_STREAM_REQUEST_BLOCK structure.

This value can then be used in subsequent <i>avcstrm.sys</i> operations by placing it in the <b>AVCStrmContext</b> member of the AVC_STREAM_REQUEST_BLOCK structure.
