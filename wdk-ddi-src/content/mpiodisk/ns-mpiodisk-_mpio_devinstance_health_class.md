## -struct-fields

### -field PathId

An unsigned 64-bitfield that returns the path identifier that is associated with this instance of a multi-path disk.


### -field NumberReads

An unsigned 64-bitfield that specifies the number of read requests that are serviced by the specified path identifier.


### -field NumberWrites

An unsigned 64-bitfield that specifies the number of write requests that are serviced by the specified path identifier


### -field NumberBytesRead

An unsigned 64-bitfield that specifies the total number of bytes that are read through the specified path identifier


### -field NumberBytesWritten

An unsigned 64-bitfield that specifies the total number of bytes that are written through the specified path identifier.


### -field NumberRetries

An unsigned 64-bitfield that specifies the total number of retries through the specified path identifier.


### -field NumberIoErrors

An unsigned 64-bitfield that specifies the total number of I/O errors that are encountered through the specified path identifier.


### -field CreateTime

A 64-bit integer that specifies the system time when this instance was created and exposed.


### -field FailTime

A 64-bit integer that specifies the system time when the path associated with this path ID was removed.


### -field DeviceOffline

A Boolean field that indicates whether the path associated with this path ID has been removed.


### -field NumberReadsWrap

An unsigned character field that specifies the total number of times the <i>NumberReads</i> parameter has rolled around to zero.


### -field NumberWritesWrap

An unsigned character field that specifies the total number of times the <i>NumberWrites</i> parameter has rolled around to zero.


### -field NumberBytesReadWrap

An unsigned character field that specifies the total number of times the <i>NumberBytesRead</i> parameter has rolled around to zero.


### -field NumberBytesWrittenWrap

An unsigned character field that specifies the total number of times the <i>NumberBytesWritten</i> parameter has rolled around to zero.


### -field Pad

Should be zero.
