# _PDO_INFORMATION structure
The PDO_INFORMATION structure represents a device-path pairing, which is an instance of a LUN through a particular path.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PDO_INFORMATION {
  PDOSCSI_ADDR ScsiAddress;
  ULONG        DeviceState;
  ULONGLONG    PathIdentifier;
  ULONG        IdentifierType;
  ULONG        IdentifierLength;
  UCHAR        Identifier[32];
  UCHAR        Pad[4];
} PDO_INFORMATION, *PPDO_INFORMATION;
````

## Members

        
            `DeviceState`

            An unsigned 32-bitfield that represents whether the path, through which this instance of the LUN was exposed, is usable.
        
            `Identifier`

            An unsigned 64-bitfield that represents the identifier that is associated with the path through which this instance of the LUN is exposed.
        
            `IdentifierLength`

            An unsigned 32-bitfield that represents the length of the identifier of the LUN's controller.
        
            `IdentifierType`

            An unsigned 32-bitfield that represents the identifier type of the LUN's controller.
        
            `Pad`

            Should be zero.
        
            `PathIdentifier`

            An unsigned 64-bitfield that represents the identifier that is associated with the path through which this instance of the LUN is exposed.
        
            `ScsiAddress`

            A PDOSCSI_ADDR structure that represents the SCSI address of the LUN's instance that corresponds to a particular path.
