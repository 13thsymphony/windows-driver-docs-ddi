# PHW_FIND_ADAPTER callback function
The PHW_FIND_ADAPTER prototype declares a routine that uses supplied configuration to determine whether a specific HBA is supported and, if it is, to return configuration information about that adapter.

## Syntax

```
PHW_FIND_ADAPTER PhwFindAdapter;

ULONG PhwFindAdapter(
  PVOID DeviceExtension,
  PVOID HwContext,
  PVOID BusInformation,
  PCHAR ArgumentString,
  PPORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION ConfigInfo,
  PBOOLEAN Again
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`DeviceExtension`

Pointer to the miniport driver's per-HBA storage area.

`HwContext`

Reserved member when used by one of the Storport driver's miniport drivers. With SCSI miniport drivers this member points to a context value. For a description of the meaning of this member for a SCSI miniport driver, see <a href="..\srb\nc-srb-phw_find_adapter.md">HwScsiFindAdapter</a>.

`BusInformation`

Reserved member when used by one of the Storport driver's miniport drivers. With SCSI miniport drivers this member points to bus-type-specific information that the OS-specific port driver has gathered. For a complete description of the meaning of this member for a SCSI miniport driver, see <a href="..\srb\nc-srb-phw_find_adapter.md">HwScsiFindAdapter</a>.

`ArgumentString`

Reserved member when used by one of the Storport driver's miniport drivers. With SCSI miniport drivers this member points to a null-terminated ASCII string that contains device information such as a base parameter or an interrupt level from the registry. For a complete description of the meaning of this member for a SCSI miniport driver, see <a href="..\srb\nc-srb-phw_find_adapter.md">HwScsiFindAdapter</a>.

`ConfigInfo`

##### 



##### 



#####

`Again`

Reserved member when used by one of the Storport driver's miniport drivers. With SCSI miniport drivers this member points to a BOOLEAN variable that informs the port driver whether it should call this routine again. For more information about the meaning of this member for a SCSI miniport driver, see <a href="..\srb\nc-srb-phw_find_adapter.md">HwScsiFindAdapter</a>.


## Return Value

The routine declared by this prototype must return one of the following status values:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>SP_RETURN_FOUND</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Indicates a supported HBA was found and that the HBA-relevant configuration information was successfully determined and set in the PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION structure.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>SP_RETURN_ERROR</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Indicates an HBA was found but there was error obtaining the configuration information. If possible, such an error should be logged with <a href="..\srb\nf-srb-scsiportlogerror.md">ScsiPortLogError</a>.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>SP_RETURN_BAD_CONFIG</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Indicates the supplied configuration information was invalid for the adapter.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>SP_RETURN_NOT_FOUND</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Indicates no supported HBA was found for the supplied configuration information.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

This declaration is used by both SCSI and StorPort miniport drivers.
