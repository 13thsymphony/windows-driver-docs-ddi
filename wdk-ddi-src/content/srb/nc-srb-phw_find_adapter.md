# PHW_FIND_ADAPTER callback



## -description
The PHW_FIND_ADAPTER prototype declares a routine that uses supplied configuration to determine whether a specific HBA is supported and, if it is, to return configuration information about that adapter. 



## -prototype

````
typedef ULONG (*PHW_FIND_ADAPTER)(
  _In_    PVOID                           DeviceExtension ,
  _In_    PVOID                           HwContext ,
  _In_    PVOID                           BusInformation,
  _In_    PCHAR                           ArgumentString,
  _Inout_ PPORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION ConfigInfo,
  _Out_   PBOOLEAN                        Again
);
````


## -parameters

### -param DeviceExtension  [in]

Pointer to the miniport driver's per-HBA storage area. 


### -param HwContext  [in]

Reserved member when used by one of the Storport driver's miniport drivers. With SCSI miniport drivers this member points to a context value. For a description of the meaning of this member for a SCSI miniport driver, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557300">HwScsiFindAdapter</a>. 


### -param BusInformation [in]

Reserved member when used by one of the Storport driver's miniport drivers. With SCSI miniport drivers this member points to bus-type-specific information that the OS-specific port driver has gathered. For a complete description of the meaning of this member for a SCSI miniport driver, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557300">HwScsiFindAdapter</a>. 


### -param ArgumentString [in]

Reserved member when used by one of the Storport driver's miniport drivers. With SCSI miniport drivers this member points to a null-terminated ASCII string that contains device information such as a base parameter or an interrupt level from the registry. For a complete description of the meaning of this member for a SCSI miniport driver, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557300">HwScsiFindAdapter</a>. 


### -param ConfigInfo [in, out]


### -param Points to a PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION structure that the miniport driver uses during initialization. 
### -param For more information about how a SCSI miniport driver uses this member, see the description of the ConfigId member of the PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION (SCSI) structure.
### -param For more information about how this member is used by a miniport driver that works with the StorPort driver, see the description of the PortConfiguration member of the PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION (STORPORT) structure.


### -param Again [out]

Reserved member when used by one of the Storport driver's miniport drivers. With SCSI miniport drivers this member points to a BOOLEAN variable that informs the port driver whether it should call this routine again. For more information about the meaning of this member for a SCSI miniport driver, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557300">HwScsiFindAdapter</a>. 


## -returns
The routine declared by this prototype must return one of the following status values:
<dl>
<dt><b>SP_RETURN_FOUND</b></dt>
</dl>Indicates a supported HBA was found and that the HBA-relevant configuration information was successfully determined and set in the PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION structure.
<dl>
<dt><b>SP_RETURN_ERROR</b></dt>
</dl>Indicates an HBA was found but there was error obtaining the configuration information. If possible, such an error should be logged with <a href="..\srb\nf-srb-scsiportlogerror.md">ScsiPortLogError</a>.
<dl>
<dt><b>SP_RETURN_BAD_CONFIG</b></dt>
</dl>Indicates the supplied configuration information was invalid for the adapter.
<dl>
<dt><b>SP_RETURN_NOT_FOUND</b></dt>
</dl>Indicates no supported HBA was found for the supplied configuration information.

 


## -remarks
This declaration is used by both SCSI and StorPort miniport drivers.

For more information about the SCSI miniport driver's version of the routine associated with this declaration, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557300">HwScsiFindAdapter</a>. 

For more information about the Storport driver's version of the routine associated with this declaration, see <a href="..\storport\nc-storport-hw_find_adapter.md">HwStorFindAdapter</a>.
