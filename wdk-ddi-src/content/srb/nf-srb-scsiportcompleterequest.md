# ScsiPortCompleteRequest function
The <b>ScsiPortCompleteRequest</b> routine completes all of the active requests for the given SCSI bus, controller, or LU, including a request being processed by the calling miniport driver routine.

## Syntax

````
VOID ScsiPortCompleteRequest(
  _In_ PVOID HwDeviceExtension,
  _In_ UCHAR PathId,
  _In_ UCHAR TargetId,
  _In_ UCHAR Lun,
  _In_ UCHAR SrbStatus
);
````

## Parameters

`HwDeviceExtension`

Pointer to the hardware device extension. This is a per-HBA storage area that the port driver allocates and initializes on behalf of the miniport driver. Miniport drivers usually store HBA-specific information in this extension, such as the state of the HBA and the HBA's mapped access ranges. This area is available to the miniport driver in the <b>DeviceExtension-&gt;HwDeviceExtension</b> member of the HBA's device object immediately after the miniport driver calls <a href="..\srb\nf-srb-scsiportinitialize.md">ScsiPortInitialize</a>. The port driver frees this memory when it removes the device.

`PathId`

Identifies the SCSI bus; SP_UNTAGGED indicates all buses controlled by the HBA.

`TargetId`

Identifies the target controller or device on the given buses; SP_UNTAGGED indicates all targets on the bus.

`Lun`

Identifies the logical unit for the given target controller or device; SP_UNTAGGED indicates all logical units for the given target controllers on the given buses.

`SrbStatus`

Specifies the completion status to be set in the <b>SrbStatus </b>member of each SRB.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

<b>ScsiPortCompleteRequest</b> can be called to complete outstanding requests after a bus reset, a device reset, or an abort, rather than calling <a href="..\srb\nf-srb-scsiportnotification.md">ScsiPortNotification</a> for each outstanding request individually. After calling <b>ScsiPortCompleteRequest</b>, do not also call <b>ScsiPortNotification</b>.
