# ScsiPortFlushDma function
The <b>ScsiPortFlushDma</b> routine flushes any data cached in the system DMA controller at the end of a transfer or terminates a system DMA transfer.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The SCSI port driver and SCSI miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## Syntax

````
VOID ScsiPortFlushDma(
  _In_ PVOID DeviceExtension
);
````

## Parameters

`DeviceExtension`

Pointer to the miniport driver's per-HBA storage area.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

Only miniport drivers of subordinate HBAs that use a system DMA controller call this routine.

<b>ScsiPortFlushDma</b> must be called after a subordinate DMA transfer operation is completed but before the SRB is completed or the next call is made to <a href="..\srb\nf-srb-scsiportiomaptransfer.md">ScsiPortIoMapTransfer</a> for the current buffer.

<b>ScsiPortFlushDma</b> also must be called after <b>ScsiPortIoMapTransfer</b> to cancel a DMA operation, even if no transfer has occurred and the driver's <a href="..\srb\nc-srb-phw_dma_started.md">HwScsiDmaStarted</a> routine has not yet been called.

## Requirements
