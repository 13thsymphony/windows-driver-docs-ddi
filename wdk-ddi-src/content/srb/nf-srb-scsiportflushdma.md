# ScsiPortFlushDma function



## -description
The <b>ScsiPortFlushDma</b> routine flushes any data cached in the system DMA controller at the end of a transfer or terminates a system DMA transfer.



## -syntax

````
VOID ScsiPortFlushDma(
  _In_ PVOID DeviceExtension
);
````


## -parameters

### -param DeviceExtension [in]

Pointer to the miniport driver's per-HBA storage area.


## -returns
None


## -remarks
Only miniport drivers of subordinate HBAs that use a system DMA controller call this routine.

<b>ScsiPortFlushDma</b> must be called after a subordinate DMA transfer operation is completed but before the SRB is completed or the next call is made to <a href="storage.scsiportiomaptransfer">ScsiPortIoMapTransfer</a> for the current buffer.

<b>ScsiPortFlushDma</b> also must be called after <b>ScsiPortIoMapTransfer</b> to cancel a DMA operation, even if no transfer has occurred and the driver's <a href="storage.hwscsidmastarted">HwScsiDmaStarted</a> routine has not yet been called.
