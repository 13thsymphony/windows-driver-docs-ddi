# ScsiPortLogError function
The <b>ScsiPortLogError</b> routine logs errors to the system event log when a miniport driver or its HBA detects a SCSI error condition.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The SCSI port driver and SCSI miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## Syntax

````
VOID ScsiPortLogError(
  _In_     PVOID               HwDeviceExtension,
  _In_opt_ PSCSI_REQUEST_BLOCK Srb,
  _In_     UCHAR               PathId,
  _In_     UCHAR               TargetId,
  _In_     UCHAR               Lun,
  _In_     ULONG               ErrorCode,
  _In_     ULONG               UniqueId
);
````

## Parameters

`HwDeviceExtension`

Pointer to the hardware device extension. This is a per-HBA storage area that the port driver allocates and initializes on behalf of the miniport driver. Miniport drivers usually store HBA-specific information in this extension, such as the state of the HBA and the HBA's mapped access ranges. This area is available to the miniport driver in the <b>DeviceExtension-&gt;HwDeviceExtension</b> member of the HBA's device object immediately after the miniport driver calls <a href="..\srb\nf-srb-scsiportinitialize.md">ScsiPortInitialize</a>. The port driver frees this memory when it removes the device.

`OPTIONAL`

TBD

`PathId`

Identifies the SCSI bus.

`TargetId`

Identifies the target controller or device on the bus.

`Lun`

Identifies the logical unit number of the target device.

`ErrorCode`

Specifies an error code indicating one of the following values as the type of error.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
SP_BAD_FW_ERROR

</td>
<td>
Indicates the driver has detected bad or old firmware. The device will not be used.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
SP_BAD_FW_WARNING

</td>
<td>
Indicates the driver has detected a card with old or bad firmware, which can result in reduced performance or functionality.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
SP_BUS_PARITY_ERROR

</td>
<td>
Indicates a SCSI bus parity error was detected.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
SP_BUS_TIME_OUT

</td>
<td>
Indicates a SCSI bus connection to a logical unit timed out.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
SP_INTERNAL_ADAPTER_ERROR

</td>
<td>
Indicates an internal HBA error was detected.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
SP_INVALID_RESELECTION

</td>
<td>
Indicates a logical unit reselected unexpectedly or with an invalid queue tag.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
SP_IRQ_NOT_RESPONDING

</td>
<td>
Indicates the HBA is not interrupting when expected.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
SP_PROTOCOL_ERROR

</td>
<td>
Indicates the miniport driver detected a SCSI bus protocol error.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
SP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT

</td>
<td>
Indicates an operation to the controller has timed out.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
SP_UNEXPECTED_DISCONNECT

</td>
<td>
Indicates that a target disconnected unexpectedly.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`UniqueId`

Specifies a unique identifier for the error. This value differentiates the current error from other errors with the same <i>ErrorCode</i>. For some miniport drivers, this identifies the line of code where the error was detected. For others, it is additional information returned by the HBA.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

A miniport driver should log all real hardware errors. However, it should not log common operational errors, such as selection time-outs or bus resets.
