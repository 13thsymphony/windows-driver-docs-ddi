# PHW_DMA_STARTED callback



## -description
The PHW_DMA_STARTED routine prototype declares a SCSI miniport driver routine that starts DMA for subordinate DMA device. 



## -prototype

````
typedef VOID (*PHW_DMA_STARTED)(
  _In_ PVOID DeviceExtension 
);
````


## -parameters

### -param DeviceExtension  [in]

Pointer to the miniport driver's per-HBA storage area. 


## -returns
None


## -remarks
If the HBA is a subordinate DMA device, the SCSI miniport driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557291">HwScsiDmaStarted</a> routine is called after the OS-specific port driver has set up the system DMA controller for a DMA transfer.

Miniport drivers that work with the StorPort driver do not support adapters that require subordinate DMA.
