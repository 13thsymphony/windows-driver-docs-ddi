# PHW_INITIALIZE callback function
The PHW_INITIALIZE routine prototype declares a routine that initializes the miniport driver after a reboot or power failure occurs.

## Syntax

```
PHW_INITIALIZE PhwInitialize;

BOOLEAN PhwInitialize(
  PVOID DeviceExtension
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`DeviceExtension`

Pointer to the miniport driver's per-HBA storage area.


## Return Value

If the operation succeeds, the initialization routine returns <b>TRUE</b>. Otherwise, the initialize routine returns <b>FALSE</b>.

## Remarks

The initialization routine for both SCSI and StorPort miniport drivers are declared using this prototype. 

For more information about the SCSI miniport driver initialization routine see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557302">HwScsiInitialize</a>. 

For more information about the miniport driver initialization routine that is used with the StorPort driver see <a href="..\storport\nc-storport-hw_initialize.md">HwStorInitialize</a>.
