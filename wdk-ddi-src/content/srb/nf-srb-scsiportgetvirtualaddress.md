# ScsiPortGetVirtualAddress function
The <b>ScsiPortGetVirtualAddress</b> routine returns a virtual address associated with a physical address if the physical address was obtained by a call to <b>ScsiPortGetPhysicalAddress</b>.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The SCSI port driver and SCSI miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## Syntax

````
PVOID ScsiPortGetVirtualAddress(
  _In_ PVOID                 HwDeviceExtension,
  _In_ SCSI_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS PhysicalAddress
);
````

## Parameters

`HwDeviceExtension`

Pointer to the hardware device extension. This is a per-HBA storage area that the port driver allocates and initializes on behalf of the miniport driver. Miniport drivers usually store HBA-specific information in this extension, such as the state of the HBA and the HBA's mapped access ranges. This area is available to the miniport driver in the <b>DeviceExtension-&gt;HwDeviceExtension</b> member of the HBA's device object immediately after the miniport driver calls <a href="..\srb\nf-srb-scsiportinitialize.md">ScsiPortInitialize</a>. The port driver frees this memory when it removes the device.

`PhysicalAddress`

Specifies the physical address to be mapped. This value must have been returned by <b>ScsiPortGetPhysicalAddress</b> and must be from an uncached device extension or SRB extension.


## Return Value

<b>ScsiPortGetVirtualAddress</b> returns a mapped pointer for the given input address. If the <i>PhysicalAddress</i> value is invalid, it returns <b>NULL</b>.

## Remarks

<b>ScsiPortGetVirtualAddress</b> uses <b>SCSI_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS</b> to represent physical addresses.

<div class="code"><span codelanguage="ManagedCPlusPlus"><table>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>
<pre>typedef PHYSICAL_ADDRESS SCSI_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS, *PSCSI_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS;
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
The <b>SCSI_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS</b> type is an operating system-independent data type that SCSI miniport drivers use to represent either a physical addresses or a bus-relative address. 

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The SCSI port driver and SCSI miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div>
