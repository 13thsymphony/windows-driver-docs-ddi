# PHW_STARTIO callback function
The PHW_INITIALIZE routine prototype declares a routine that initializes the miniport driver after a reboot or power failure occurs.

## Syntax

```
PHW_STARTIO PhwStartio;

BOOLEAN PhwStartio(
  PVOID DeviceExtension,
  PSCSI_REQUEST_BLOCK Srb
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`DeviceExtension`

Pointer to the miniport driver's per-HBA storage area.

`Srb`

Pointer to the SCSI request block to be started.


## Return Value

The start I/O routine returns <b>TRUE</b> to acknowledge receipt of the SCSI request block (SRB). If the start I/O routine does not receive a well-formed SRB, it returns <b>FALSE</b>.

## Remarks

The start routine for both SCSI and StorPort miniport drivers are declared using this prototype. 

For more information about the SCSI miniport driver's start I/O routine see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557323">HwScsiStartIo</a>. 

For more information about the miniport driver's start I/O routine that is used with the StorPort driver see <a href="..\storport\nc-storport-hw_startio.md">HwStorStartIo</a>.
