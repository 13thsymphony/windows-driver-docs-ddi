# ScsiPortGetLogicalUnit function
The <b>ScsiPortGetLogicalUnit</b> routine returns a pointer to the miniport driver's per-LU storage area for a given peripheral.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The SCSI port driver and SCSI miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## Syntax

````
PVOID ScsiPortGetLogicalUnit(
  _In_ PVOID HwDeviceExtension,
  _In_ UCHAR PathId,
  _In_ UCHAR TargetId,
  _In_ UCHAR Lun
);
````

## Parameters

`HwDeviceExtension`

Pointer to the hardware device extension. This is a per-HBA storage area that the port driver allocates and initializes on behalf of the miniport driver. Miniport drivers usually store HBA-specific information in this extension, such as the state of the HBA and the HBA's mapped access ranges. This area is available to the miniport driver in the <b>DeviceExtension-&gt;HwDeviceExtension</b> member of the HBA's device object immediately after the miniport driver calls <a href="..\srb\nf-srb-scsiportinitialize.md">ScsiPortInitialize</a>. The port driver frees this memory when it removes the device.

`PathId`

Identifies the SCSI bus.

`TargetId`

Identifies the target controller or device on the bus.

`Lun`

Identifies the logical unit number of the target device.


## Return Value

<b>ScsiPortGetLogicalUnit</b> returns a pointer to the miniport driver's storage area for the requested logical unit. If the operating system-specific port driver considers this logical unit to be nonexistent, it returns <b>NULL</b>.

## Remarks

<b>ScsiPortGetLogicalUnit</b> is irrelevant if the miniport driver's <b>DriverEntry</b> routine specified zero for the <b>LuExtensionSize</b> in the HW_INITIALIZATION_DATA when it called <b>ScsiPortInitialize</b>. Otherwise, the operating system-specific port driver allocates and initializes with zeros a set of LU extensions of the specified size for the miniport driver to use.

Per-LU storage can be used to store data relevant to a particular peripheral, such as saved data pointers. To access this area, the miniport driver calls <b>ScsiPortGetLogicalUnit</b> when the driver is maintaining information about the state of or current operation for any particular peripheral.

The operating system-specific port driver can consider a logical unit to be nonexistent if there is no active request for that logical unit and the device has never been successfully selected.
