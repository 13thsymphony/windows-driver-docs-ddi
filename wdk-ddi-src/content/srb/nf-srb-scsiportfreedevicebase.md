# ScsiPortFreeDeviceBase function
The <b>ScsiPortFreeDeviceBase</b> routine frees a range of device I/O or memory space addresses previously mapped into the system address space with <b>ScsiPortGetDeviceBase</b>.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The SCSI port driver and SCSI miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## Syntax

````
VOID ScsiPortFreeDeviceBase(
  _In_ PVOID HwDeviceExtension,
  _In_ PVOID MappedAddress
);
````

## Parameters

`HwDeviceExtension`

Pointer to the hardware device extension. This is a per-HBA storage area that the port driver allocates and initializes on behalf of the miniport driver. Miniport drivers usually store HBA-specific information in this extension, such as the state of the HBA and the HBA's mapped access ranges. This area is available to the miniport driver in the <b>DeviceExtension-&gt;HwDeviceExtension</b> member of the HBA's device object immediately after the miniport driver calls <a href="..\srb\nf-srb-scsiportinitialize.md">ScsiPortInitialize</a>. The port driver frees this memory when it removes the device.

`MappedAddress`

Pointer to the base address of the range to be freed. This address must be the same as that returned by <a href="..\srb\nf-srb-scsiportgetdevicebase.md">ScsiPortGetDeviceBase</a>.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

If a miniport driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557300">HwScsiFindAdapter</a> routine determines that the driver does not need a particular mapped base address for an adapter, it must release the mapping by calling this routine. For example, when a miniport driver determines there are no supported HBAs on a particular I/O bus, it must call <b>ScsiPortFreeDeviceBase</b> with each mapped address returned by <b>ScsiPortGetDeviceBase</b>, if any calls to this routine were made.

<b>ScsiPortFreeDeviceBase</b> can be called only from miniport driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557300">HwScsiFindAdapter</a> routine. Calls from other miniport driver routines will result in system failure or incorrect operation for the caller.
