## -struct-fields

### -field Header

The 
     <a href="netvista.ndis_object_header">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a> structure for the
     NDIS_PORT_AUTHENTICATION_PARAMETERS structure. Set the 
     <b>Type</b> member of the structure that 
     <b>Header</b> specifies to NDIS_OBJECT_TYPE_DEFAULT, the 
     <b>Revision</b> member to NDIS_PORT_AUTHENTICATION_PARAMETERS_REVISION_1, and the 
     <b>Size</b> member to NDIS_SIZEOF_PORT_AUTHENTICATION_PARAMETERS_REVISION_1.


### -field SendControlState

The control state of the port that the miniport adapter should use for send operations. This
     member must contain one of the following values:
     




### -field NdisPortControlStateUnknown

The port's control state for send operations is unknown.


### -field NdisPortControlStateControlled

The port is in a controlled state for send operations. That is, the port requires
       authorization.


### -field NdisPortControlStateUncontrolled

The port is in an uncontrolled state for send operations. That is, the port does not require
       authorization.

</dd>
</dl>

### -field RcvControlState

The control state of the port that the miniport adapter should use for receive operations. This
     member must contain one of the following values:
     




### -field NdisPortControlStateUnknown

The port's control state for receive operations is unknown.


### -field NdisPortControlStateControlled

The port is in a controlled state for receive operations. That is, the port requires
       authorization.


### -field NdisPortControlStateUncontrolled

The port is in an uncontrolled state for receive operations. That is, the port does not require
       authorization.

</dd>
</dl>

### -field SendAuthorizationState

The authorization state of the port that the miniport adapter should use for send operations.
     Ignore this member if the 
     <b>SendControlState</b> member is set to 
     <b>NdisPortControlStateUncontrolled</b>.
     

This member must contain one of the following values:




### -field NdisPortAuthorizationUnknown

The port's authorization state for send operations is unknown.


### -field NdisPortAuthorized

The port is authorized for send operations.


### -field NdisPortUnauthorized

The port is not authorized for send operations.


### -field NdisPortReauthorizing

The port is re-authorizing for send operations.

</dd>
</dl>

### -field RcvAuthorizationState

The authorization state of the port that the miniport adapter should use for receive operations.
     Ignore this member if the 
     <b>RcvControlState</b> member is set to 
     <b>NdisPortControlStateUncontrolled</b>.
     

This member must contain one of the following values:




### -field NdisPortAuthorizationUnknown

The port's authorization state for receive operations is unknown.


### -field NdisPortAuthorized

The port is authorized for receive operations.


### -field NdisPortUnauthorized

The port is not authorized for receive operations.


### -field NdisPortReauthorizing

The port is re-authorizing for receive operations.

</dd>
</dl>

## -remarks
The NDIS_PORT_AUTHENTICATION_PARAMETERS structure is used in 
    <a href="netvista.oid_gen_port_authentication_parameters">
    OID_GEN_PORT_AUTHENTICATION_PARAMETERS</a> OID requests to specify the current authentication state of
    an NDIS port.
