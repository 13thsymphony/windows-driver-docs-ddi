# _NDIS_SRIOV_PROBED_BARS_INFO structure
The <b>NDIS_SRIOV_PROBED_BARS_INFO</b> structure specifies the values of the PCI Express (PCIe) Base Address Registers (BARs) of a network adapter that supports the single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) interface. 
 

The values specified by the <b>NDIS_SRIOV_PROBED_BARS_INFO</b> structure are those that were reported by the adapter following a query that was performed by the PCI bus driver. This query determines the memory or I/O address space that is required by the device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _NDIS_SRIOV_PROBED_BARS_INFO {
  NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER Header;
  ULONG              BaseRegisterValuesOffset;
} NDIS_SRIOV_PROBED_BARS_INFO, *PNDIS_SRIOV_PROBED_BARS_INFO;
````

## Members


`BaseRegisterValuesOffset`

A ULONG value that contains the offset, in units of bytes, from the beginning of this structure to an array of ULONG values. The array  contains a ULONG value for each BAR of the PCIe network adapter.

The maximum number of elements within this array is PCI_TYPE0_ADDRESSES.

For more information, see the Remarks section.

`Header`

The type, revision, and size of the <b>NDIS_SRIOV_PROBED_BARS_INFO</b> structure. This member is formatted as an <a href="..\ntddndis\ns-ntddndis-_ndis_object_header.md">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a> structure.

The miniport driver must set the <b>Type</b> member of <b>Header</b> to NDIS_OBJECT_TYPE_DEFAULT. To specify the version of the <b>NDIS_SRIOV_PROBED_BARS_INFO</b> structure, the driver must set the <b>Revision</b> member of <b>Header</b> to the following value: 





#### NDIS_SRIOV_PROBED_BARS_INFO_REVISION_1

Original version for NDIS 6.30 and later.

Set the <b>Size</b> member to NDIS_SIZEOF_SRIOV_PROBED_BARS_INFO_REVISION_1.

## Remarks
The <b>NDIS_SRIOV_PROBED_BARS_INFO</b> structure is used in OID query requests of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451870">OID_SRIOV_PROBED_BARS</a>.  Each
    element in the array that follows the <b>NDIS_SRIOV_PROBED_BARS_INFO</b> structure contains a ULONG value for a BAR of the network adapter. The offsets of the elements within the array must match the offsets of the BARs on the adapter.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Each element in the array must contain the BAR value that was returned during the BAR query that was performed by the PCI bus driver.</div>
<div> </div>
For more information about the base address registers of a PCI device, see the <i>PCI Local Bus Specification</i>.
