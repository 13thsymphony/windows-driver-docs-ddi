# _NDIS_LINK_SPEED structure
The NDIS_LINK_SPEED structure specifies transmit and receive link speeds.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _NDIS_LINK_SPEED {
  ULONG64 XmitLinkSpeed;
  ULONG64 RcvLinkSpeed;
} NDIS_LINK_SPEED, *PNDIS_LINK_SPEED;
````

## Members


`RcvLinkSpeed`

The receive link speed in bits per second. A value of -1 in this member indicates that the receive
     link speed is unknown.

`XmitLinkSpeed`

The transmit link speed in bits per second. A value of -1 in this member indicates that the
     transmit link speed is unknown.

## Remarks
The NDIS_LINK_SPEED structure specifies link speeds in the 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569594">OID_GEN_LINK_SPEED_EX</a> and 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569602">OID_GEN_MAX_LINK_SPEED</a> OIDs.
