## -enum-fields

### -field NdisWakeReasonUnspecified

The type of wake-up event is not specified.

### -field NdisWakeReasonPacket

The network adapter generated the wake-up event because it received a packet that matched a wake-on-LAN (WOL) pattern.

### -field NdisWakeReasonMediaDisconnect

The network adapter generated the wake-up event because it disconnected from the network media.

### -field NdisWakeReasonMediaConnect

The network adapter generated the wake-up event because it connected to the network media.

### -field NdisWakeReasonWlanNLODiscovery

The 802.11 network adapter generated the wake-up event because it detected a service set identifier (SSID) that was specified through a network list offload (NLO). 
For more information about NLO, see <a href="netvista.wi-fi_network_list_offload">Wi-Fi Network List Offload</a>.

### -field NdisWakeReasonWlanAPAssociationLost

The 802.11 network adapter generated the wake-up event because it became disassociated with the access point (AP).

### -field NdisWakeReasonWlanGTKHandshakeError

The 802.11 network adapter generated the wake-up event because it encountered an error during the IEEE 802.11i RSN group transient key (GTK) handshake with the AP.

### -field NdisWakeReasonWlan4WayHandshakeRequest

The 802.11 network adapter generated the wake-up event because it received the first frame of the IEEE 802.11i RSN 4-way handshake with the AP. This handshake is performed when the adapter authenticates with the AP.

### -field NdisWakeReasonWwanRegisterState

The mobile broadband (MB) network adapter generated the wake-up event because its registration state to the MB Service has changed.

### -field NdisWakeReasonWwanSMSReceive

The mobile broadband (MB) network adapter generated the wake-up event because the MB Service has to be notified about the receipt of a Short Message Service (SMS) message. The adapter generates this wake-up event either after the completion of a previously-issued <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569839">OID_WWAN_SMS_READ</a> query request, or the arrival of a new class-0 (flash/alert) message from the network provider as an event notification.

### -field NdisWakeReasonWwanUSSDReceive

The mobile broadband (MB) network adapter generated the wake-up event because it received an Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) message.

## -remarks
The  
    <b>WakeReason</b> member of the 
    <a href="netvista.ndis_pm_wake_reason">NDIS_PM_WAKE_REASON</a> structure contains an <b>NDIS_PM_WAKE_REASON_TYPE</b> enumeration value.
