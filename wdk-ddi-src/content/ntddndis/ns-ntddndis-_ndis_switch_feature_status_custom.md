# _NDIS_SWITCH_FEATURE_STATUS_CUSTOM structure
The <b>NDIS_SWITCH_FEATURE_STATUS_CUSTOM</b> structure specifies the  custom status information for a Hyper-V extensible switch. This information is known as <i>feature status</i> information. The format of this information is defined by the independent software vendor (ISV). 



The <b>NDIS_SWITCH_FEATURE_STATUS_CUSTOM</b> structure specifies the  custom status information for a Hyper-V extensible switch. This information is known as <i>feature status</i> information. The format of this information is defined by the independent software vendor (ISV).

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _NDIS_SWITCH_FEATURE_STATUS_CUSTOM {
  NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER Header;
  ULONG              Flags;
  ULONG              FeatureStatusCustomBufferLength;
  ULONG              FeatureStatusCustomBufferOffset;
} NDIS_SWITCH_FEATURE_STATUS_CUSTOM, *PNDIS_SWITCH_FEATURE_STATUS_CUSTOM;
````

## Members

        
            `FeatureStatusCustomBufferLength`

            A ULONG value that specifies the size, in bytes, of the feature status buffer.
        
            `FeatureStatusCustomBufferOffset`

            A ULONG value that specifies the offset, in bytes, to the  feature status buffer that follows the <b>NDIS_SWITCH_FEATURE_STATUS_CUSTOM</b> structure. The offset is measured from the start of the <b>NDIS_SWITCH_FEATURE_STATUS_CUSTOM</b> structure up to the beginning of the feature status buffer.
        
            `Flags`

            A ULONG value that contains a bitwise <b>OR</b> of flags. This member is reserved for NDIS.
        
            `Header`

            The type, revision, and size of the <b>NDIS_SWITCH_FEATURE_STATUS_CUSTOM</b> structure. This member is formatted as an <a href="..\ntddndis\ns-ntddndis-_ndis_object_header.md">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a> structure.

The <b>Type</b> member of <b>Header</b> must be set to NDIS_OBJECT_TYPE_DEFAULT. To specify the version of the <b>NDIS_SWITCH_FEATURE_STATUS_CUSTOM</b> structure, the <b>Revision</b> member of <b>Header</b> must be set to the following value:

    ## Remarks
        The <a href="..\ntddndis\ns-ntddndis-_ndis_switch_feature_status_parameters.md">NDIS_SWITCH_FEATURE_STATUS_PARAMETERS</a> structure is used in OID method requests of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh598260">OID_SWITCH_FEATURE_STATUS_QUERY</a>. This OID request returns the following structures in the information buffer that is associated with the OID request:<ul>
<li>
An <a href="..\ntddndis\ns-ntddndis-_ndis_switch_feature_status_parameters.md">NDIS_SWITCH_FEATURE_STATUS_PARAMETERS</a> structure that specifies the parameters for the feature status information that is to be returned for the extensible switch.  The switch extension populates the <b>FeatureStatusVersion</b> member of the structure to reflect the version of the custom status being returned in the NDIS_SWITCH_FEATURE_STATUS_CUSTOM buffer. The Hyper-v Extensible switch populates all other members when issuing the query OID.

</li>
<li>
An <b>NDIS_SWITCH_FEATURE_STATUS_CUSTOM</b> structure that contains the feature status data for the extensible switch.  The switch extension populates the <b>FeatureStatusCustomBufferLength</b> member of the structure to reflect the size of the custom status being returned. The Hyper-v Extensible switch populates all other members when issuing the query OID.

</li>
</ul> The <b>InformationBuffer</b> member of the <a href="..\ndis\ns-ndis-_ndis_oid_request.md">NDIS_OID_REQUEST</a> structure contains a pointer to this information buffer.

An <a href="..\ntddndis\ns-ntddndis-_ndis_switch_feature_status_parameters.md">NDIS_SWITCH_FEATURE_STATUS_PARAMETERS</a> structure that specifies the parameters for the feature status information that is to be returned for the extensible switch.  The switch extension populates the <b>FeatureStatusVersion</b> member of the structure to reflect the version of the custom status being returned in the NDIS_SWITCH_FEATURE_STATUS_CUSTOM buffer. The Hyper-v Extensible switch populates all other members when issuing the query OID.

An <b>NDIS_SWITCH_FEATURE_STATUS_CUSTOM</b> structure that contains the feature status data for the extensible switch.  The switch extension populates the <b>FeatureStatusCustomBufferLength</b> member of the structure to reflect the size of the custom status being returned. The Hyper-v Extensible switch populates all other members when issuing the query OID.
