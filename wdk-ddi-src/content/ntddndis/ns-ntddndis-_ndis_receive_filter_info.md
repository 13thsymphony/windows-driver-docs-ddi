# _NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO structure
The <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO</b> structure contains information about a receive filter that is currently configured on a miniport driver.



NDIS receive filters are used in the following NDIS interfaces:
<ul>
<li>

<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/500FBF0F-54D9-4675-8E2D-447387DA8798">NDIS Packet Coalescing</a>. For more information about how to use receive filters in this interface, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/20EA71E0-B880-4891-A12E-76F4C9AB16E6">Managing Packet Coalescing Receive Filters</a>.

</li>
<li>

For more information about how to use receive filters in this interface, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/F0137D59-1701-4DFC-BB30-27E477FC0706">Setting a Receive Filter on a Virtual Port</a>.

</li>

</ul>

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO {
  NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER       Header;
  ULONG                    Flags;
  NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_TYPE FilterType;
  NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_ID   FilterId;
} NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO, *PNDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO;
````

## Members


`FilterId`

A receive filter identifier. The filter identifier
     is an integer from one up to and including the number of receive filters that the network adapter
     supports. A value of zero is not valid.

`FilterType`

The type of the receive filter.

`Flags`

A bitwise OR of flags. This member is reserved for NDIS.

`Header`

The 
     <a href="..\ntddndis\ns-ntddndis-_ndis_object_header.md">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a> structure for the
     <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO</b> structure. The driver sets the 
     <b>Type</b> member of the structure that 
     <b>Header</b> specifies to NDIS_OBJECT_TYPE_DEFAULT.

To indicate the version of the <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO</b> structure, the driver sets the 
     <b>Revision</b> member to one of the following values:





#### NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO_REVISION_1

Original version for NDIS 6.20.

The driver sets the 
        <b>Size</b> member to NDIS_SIZEOF_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO_REVISION_1.

## Remarks
The <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO</b> structure is used with the 
    <a href="..\ntddndis\ns-ntddndis-_ndis_receive_filter_info_array.md">
    NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_INFO_ARRAY</a> structure for the 
    OID request of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/network/oid-receive-filter-enum-filters">OID_RECEIVE_FILTER_ENUM_FILTERS</a>. This OID request enumerates receive filters that have been configured on the miniport driver. This includes packet coalescing receive filters or the receive filters configured on a  receive queue that is used in the VMQ or SR-IOV interface.

## Requirements

| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows version** | Supported in NDIS 6.20 and later. Supported in NDIS 6.20 and later. |
