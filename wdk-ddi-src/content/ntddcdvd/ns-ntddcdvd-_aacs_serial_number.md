# _AACS_SERIAL_NUMBER structure
The AACS_SERIAL_NUMBER structure contains an Advanced Access Content System (AACS) serial number and corresponding message authentication code (MAC).

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _AACS_SERIAL_NUMBER {
  UCHAR PrerecordedSerialNumber[16];
  UCHAR MAC[16];
} AACS_SERIAL_NUMBER, *PAACS_SERIAL_NUMBER;
````

## Members


`MAC`

The message authentication code (MAC) that the client uses to verify that the serial number is for the current AACS authentication sequence.

`PrerecordedSerialNumber`

The serial number.

## Remarks
Clients retrieve the AACS serial number with an <a href="..\ntddcdvd\ni-ntddcdvd-ioctl_aacs_read_serial_number.md">IOCTL_AACS_READ_SERIAL_NUMBER</a> request.
