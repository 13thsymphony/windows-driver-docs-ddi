# IOCTL_AACS_READ_MEDIA_KEY_BLOCK_SIZE IOCTL



## -description
Queries the logical unit for the size of the buffer that is required to hold the Advanced Access Control System (AACS) Media Key Block (MKB). 



## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
The buffer at <b>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> contains the AACS_LAYER_NUMBER number of the layer. The AACS_LAYER_NUMBER is an unsigned long integer value in the range 0 to 255 inclusive that specifies the layer of the media to which a command applies.

<code>typedef ULONG AACS_LAYER_NUMBER, *PAACS_LAYER_NUMBER;
</code>


### -input-buffer-length
<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> in the I/O stack location indicates the size, in bytes, of the buffer, which must be &gt;= <b>sizeof</b>(AACS_LAYER_NUMBER).


### -output-buffer
The buffer at <b>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> contains a ULONG that holds the size in bytes of the full AACS MKB for this media.


### -output-buffer-length
Use this value to determine the size of the buffer to allocate for <a href="..\ntddcdvd\ni-ntddcdvd-ioctl_aacs_read_media_key_block.md">IOCTL_AACS_READ_MEDIA_KEY_BLOCK</a>. The size is always a multiple of 32,768 (0x8000).


### -in-out-buffer

<text></text>

### -inout-buffer-length

<text></text>

### -status-block
I/O Status block
The <b>Information</b> field is set to the number of bytes transferred. The <b>Status</b> field is set to STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. The following failure codes are common with this operation:



Failure of one of the copy protection mechanisms.

The authentication process has failed.

No AACS protection exists for this media.

The AGID for AACS has not been established.


## -remarks
The IOCTL_AACS_READ_MEDIA_KEY_BLOCK_SIZE request will not work if the media in the logical unit is not AACS protected.

The IOCTL_AACS_READ_MEDIA_KEY_BLOCK_SIZE request corresponds to one of the steps of the Advanced Access Content System (AACS) authentication algorithm (AACS-Auth). For a complete description of AACS-Auth, see the <i>Advanced Access Content System, Introduction and Common Cryptographic Elements</i> specification that is published by Advanced Access Content System Licensing Administrator (AACS LA).
