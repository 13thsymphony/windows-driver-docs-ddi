### -input-buffer
<p><b>Irp-&gt;UserBuffer</b> points to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff539949">HID_XFER_PACKET</a> structure that the HID class driver uses to input the following members:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Points to a requester-allocated output buffer that a HID minidriver uses to return a feature report.</p>

<p>Specifies the size, in bytes, of the output buffer.</p>

<p>Specifies a report ID associated with a top-level collection.</p>

### -input-buffer-length

### -status-block
I/O Status block
<p>HID minidrivers that carry out the I/O to the device set the following fields of <b>Irp-&gt;IoStatus</b>:</p>

<p><b>Information</b> is set to the number of bytes transferred from the device.</p>

<p><b>Status</b> is set to STATUS_SUCCESS if the transfer completed without error. Otherwise, it is set to an appropriate NTSTATUS error code.</p>

<p>HID minidrivers that call other drivers with this IOCTL to carry out the I/O to their device, should ensure that the <b>Information</b> field of the status block is correct and not change the contents of the <b>Status</b> field.</p>
