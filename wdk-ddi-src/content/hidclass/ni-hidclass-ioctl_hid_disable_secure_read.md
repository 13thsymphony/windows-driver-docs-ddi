# IOCTL_HID_DISABLE_SECURE_READ IOCTL
The IOCTL_HID_DISABLE_SECURE_READ request cancels an <a href="..\hidclass\ni-hidclass-ioctl_hid_enable_secure_read.md">IOCTL_HID_ENABLE_SECURE_READ</a> request for a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2d3efb38-4eba-43db-8cff-9fac30209952">HID collection</a>. Only a "trusted" user-mode application (an application with SeTcbPrivilege privileges) can successfully use this request. Kernel-mode drivers have SeTcbPrivilege privileges by default, but user-mode applications do not.

For information about how to use enable and disable secure read requests to enforce a secure read for a collection, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/be3c7d1b-195c-4b7f-a404-070b3b265333">Enforcing a Secure Read For a HID Collection</a>.
