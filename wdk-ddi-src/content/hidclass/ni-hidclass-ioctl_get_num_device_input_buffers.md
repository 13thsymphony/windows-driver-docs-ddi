# IOCTL_GET_NUM_DEVICE_INPUT_BUFFERS IOCTL



## -description
The IOCTL_GET_NUM_DEVICE_INPUT_BUFFERS request obtains the size of the input report queue for a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/dcbee8e3-d03a-45c8-92e4-0897b9f55177">top-level collection</a>. 

The input report queue is implemented as a ring buffer. If a collection transmits data to the HID class driver faster than the input reports are read, reports can be lost. The size of the input report queue can be adjusted using <a href="..\hidclass\ni-hidclass-ioctl_set_num_device_input_buffers.md">IOCTL_SET_NUM_DEVICE_INPUT_BUFFERS</a>. 

For general information about HIDClass devices, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2d3efb38-4eba-43db-8cff-9fac30209952">HID Collections</a>. 



## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.OutputBufferLength</b> in the I/O stack location of the IRP indicates the size, in bytes, of the output buffer, which must be &gt;= <b>sizeof</b>(ULONG). 


### -input-buffer-length
The size of the buffer is <b>sizeof</b>(ULONG). 


### -output-buffer
<b>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> points to a buffer that will receive the size of the report input queue. 


### -output-buffer-length
The size of the buffer is <b>sizeof</b>(ULONG). 


### -in-out-buffer

<text></text>

### -inout-buffer-length

<text></text>

### -status-block
I/O Status block
The HID class driver sets the following fields of <b>Irp-&gt;IoStatus</b>:

<b>Information</b> is set to <b>sizeof</b>(ULONG) if the size of the report input queue is successfully retrieved. 

<b>Status</b> is set to STATUS_SUCCESS if the transfer completed without error. Otherwise, it is set to an appropriate NTSTATUS error code.
