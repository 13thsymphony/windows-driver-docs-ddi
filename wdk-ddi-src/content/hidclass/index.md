| [IOCTL_HID_GET_INDEXED_STRING IOCTL](ni-hidclass-ioctl-hid-get-indexed-string.md) | The IOCTL_HID_GET_INDEXED_STRING request obtains a specified embedded string for a top-level collection. |
| [IOCTL_HID_GET_INPUT_REPORT IOCTL](ni-hidclass-ioctl-hid-get-input-report.md) | IOCTL_HID_GET_INPUT_REPORT returns an input report from a HID Class device. |
| [IOCTL_HID_GET_MANUFACTURER_STRING IOCTL](ni-hidclass-ioctl-hid-get-manufacturer-string.md) | The IOCTL_HID_GET_MANUFACTURER_STRING request obtains a top-level collection's embedded string that identifies the manufacturer of the device. |
| [IOCTL_HID_GET_MS_GENRE_DESCRIPTOR IOCTL](ni-hidclass-ioctl-hid-get-ms-genre-descriptor.md) | The IOCTL_HID_GET_MS_GENRE_DESCRIPTOR request is used for retrieving the genre descriptor for the device. |
