# _PTS_DATA structure
The PTS_DATA structure is used for protocol type selection (PTS).

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PTS_DATA {
  UCHAR Type;
  UCHAR Fl;
  UCHAR Dl;
  ULONG CLKFrequency;
  ULONG DataRate;
  UCHAR StopBits;
} PTS_DATA, *PPTS_DATA;
````

## Members

        
            `CLKFrequency`

            Contains the clock frequency. Some smart card readers must be programmed by using the new clock frequency to use after the PTS request.
        
            `DataRate`

            Contains the new data rate. Some smart card readers (for example, serial readers) must be set to the new data rate to use after a PTS request.
        
            `Dl`

            The Dl value to use as part of PTS1 for the PTS request.
        
            `Fl`

            The Fl value to use as part of PTS1 for the PTS request.
        
            `StopBits`

            Contains the number of stop bits to use with the inserted card.
        
            `Type`

            Controls how the remaining members of this structure are calculated. This member can have one of the following values:

    ## Remarks
        The smart card reader driver library assigns values to the members of this structure before it calls the callback function that sets the protocol. The driver library considers the characteristics of the inserted smart card, the supported clock frequencies, and supported data rates of the reader when it assigns the values. </p>
