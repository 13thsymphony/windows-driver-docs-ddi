# _CLOCK_RATE_CONVERSION structure



## -description
The CLOCK_RATE_CONVERSION structure holds a value that determines the duration of a bit of data and the corresponding maximum operating frequency that accompanies the indicated bit length. 



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _CLOCK_RATE_CONVERSION {
  const ULONG F;
  const ULONG fs;
} CLOCK_RATE_CONVERSION, *PCLOCK_RATE_CONVERSION;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field F

Contains a value that calculates the elementary time unit (ETU). The ETU indicates the space of transmission time that is occupied by a single bit of data. For more information, see the <i>ISO 7816-3 Specification</i>. 


### -field fs

Contains the maximum clock frequency that is allowed.  For more information, see the <i>ISO 7816-3 Specification</i>. 


## -remarks
As stated in the <i>ISO 7816-3 Specification</i>, the operating system defines an array of CLOCK_RATE_CONVERSION structures that determine the maximum operating frequency for a smart card or a smart card reader. The <i>ISO 7816-3 Specification</i> defines a mapping between ETUs and clock frequencies. The following array, defined in <i>Smclib.h</i>, shows the mapping:
