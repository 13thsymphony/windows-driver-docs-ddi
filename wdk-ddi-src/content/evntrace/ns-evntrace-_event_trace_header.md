# _EVENT_TRACE_HEADER structure



## -description
The <b>EVENT_TRACE_HEADER</b> structure is used to pass a WMI event to the WMI event logger. It is overlaid on the <a href="..\wmistr\ns-wmistr-_wnode_header.md">WNODE_HEADER</a> portion of the <a href="..\wmistr\ns-wmistr-tagwnode_event_item.md">WNODE_EVENT_ITEM</a> passed to <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iowmiwriteevent.md">IoWMIWriteEvent</a>. Information contained in the <b>EVENT_TRACE_HEADER</b> is written to the WMI log file.

## -struct-fields

### -field Size

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the buffer that is allocated to hold event tracing information. The value that is specified must include both the size of the <b>EVENT_TRACE_HEADER</b> structure and the size of any driver-specific data. (<b>EVENT_TRACE_HEADER</b> is overlaid on a <a href="..\wmistr\ns-wmistr-_wnode_header.md">WNODE_HEADER</a> structure, but the <b>Size</b> member of <b>EVENT_TRACE_HEADER</b> and the <b>BufferSize</b> member of <b>WNODE_HEADER</b> do not specify the same size. Do not use the <b>BufferSize</b> member of <b>WNODE_HEADER</b> to set the <b>Size</b> member.) 


### -field FieldTypeFlags

Flags to indicate which fields in the <b>EVENT_TRACE_HEADER</b> structure are valid.


### -field HeaderType

Reserved for internal use.


### -field MarkerFlags

Reserved for internal use.


### -field Version

Drivers can use this member to store version information. This information is not interpreted by the event logger.


### -field Class


       Event class information.


### -field Type

Trace event type. This can be one of the predefined EVENT_TRACE_TYPE_<i>XXX</i> values contained in Evntrace.h or can be a driver-defined value. Callers are free to define private event types with values greater than the reserved values in Evntrace.h.


### -field Level

Trace instrumentation level. A driver-defined value meant to represent the degree of detail of the trace instrumentation. Drivers are free to give this value meaning. This value should be 0 by default. More information about how consumers can request different levels of trace information will be provided in a future version of the documentation.


### -field Version

Version of trace record. Version information that can be used by the driver to track different event formats.

</dd>
</dl>

### -field ThreadId

Thread identifier.


### -field ProcessId

Process identifier.


### -field TimeStamp

The time at which the driver event occurred. This time value is expressed in absolute system time format. Absolute system time is the number of 100-nanosecond intervals since the start of the year 1601 in the Gregorian calendar. If the WNODE_FLAG_USE_TIMESTAMP is set in <b>Flags,</b> the system logger will leave the value of <b>TimeStamp</b> unchanged. Otherwise, the system logger will set the value of <b>TimeStamp</b> at the time it receives the event. A driver can call <b>KeQuerySystemTime</b> to set the value of <b>TimeStamp</b>. 


### -field Guid

The GUID that identifies the data block for the event. 


### -field GuidPtr

If the WNODE_FLAG_USE_GUID_PTR flag bit is set in <b>Flags</b>, <b>GuidPtr</b> points to the GUID that identifies the data block for the event.


### -field KernelTime

Reserved for internal use.


### -field UserTime

Reserved for internal use.


### -field ProcessorTime

Reserved for internal use.


### -field ClientContext

Reserved for internal use.


### -field Flags

Provides information about the contents of this structure. For information about <b>EVENT_TRACE_HEADER</b><b> Flags</b> values, see the <b>Flags</b> description in <a href="..\wmistr\ns-wmistr-_wnode_header.md">WNODE_HEADER</a>.


## -remarks
A driver that supports trace events will use this structure to report events to the WMI event logger. Trace events should not be reported until the driver receives a request to enable events and the control GUID is one the driver supports. The driver should initialize an <b>EVENT_TRACE_HEADER</b> structure, fill in any user-defined event data at the end, and pass a pointer to the <b>EVENT_TRACE_HEADER</b> to <b>IoWMIWriteEvent</b>. The driver should continue reporting trace events until it receives a request to disable the control GUID for the trace events.

If the driver does not specify the WNODE_FLAG_USE_MOF_PTR flag in the <b>Flags</b> member of <b>EVENT_TRACE_HEADER</b>, the <b>EVENT_TRACE_HEADER</b> structure is followed in memory by event-specific data. In this case, the <b>Size</b> member must be <b>sizeof</b>(<b>EVENT_TRACE_HEADER</b>) plus the size of the event-specific data. 

If the driver does specify the WNODE_FLAG_USE_MOF_PTR flag, the <b>EVENT_TRACE_HEADER</b> structure is followed in memory by an array of <b>MOF_FIELD</b> structures (which are defined in Evntrace.h) that contain pointers to the data and sizes rather than the event tracing data itself. In this case, the <b>Size</b> member must be <b>sizeof</b>(<b>EVENT_TRACE_HEADER</b>) plus the size of the array of <b>MOF_FIELD</b> structures.
