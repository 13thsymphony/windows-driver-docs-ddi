# DUMP_READ callback



## -description
The <i>Dump_Read</i> callback routine is called after the read from the dump port driver. The filter driver can access the dump data during the call to this routine.


## -prototype

````
PDUMP_READ Dump_Read;

NTSTATUS Dump_Read(
  _In_ PFILTER_EXTENSION FilterExtension,
  _In_ PLARGE_INTEGER    DiskByteOffset,
  _In_ PMDL              Mdl
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param FilterExtension [in]

A pointer to a <a href="storage.filter_extension">FILTER_EXTENSION</a> structure.

### -param DiskByteOffset [in]

The value, in bytes, relative to the source partition for the crash dump or hibernation. Filter drivers should not modify this field.

### -param Mdl [in]

A pointer to an <a href="kernel.mdl">MDL</a> structure that describes the data buffer containing the dump data. Filter drivers should not modify this field.

## -returns
If the routine succeeds, it must return STATUS_SUCCESS. Otherwise, it must return one of the error status values defined in <i>Ntstatus.h</i>.

## -remarks
Filter drivers can read the data that was read by the crashdump process. 

Filter drivers can modify the contents of the data buffer contained in <b>Mdl</b> to revert any changes made to the data when it was written to disk.
