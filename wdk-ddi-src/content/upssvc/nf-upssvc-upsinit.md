# UPSInit function



## -description
The <b>UPSInit</b> function initializes a UPS minidriver, opens communication to the UPS unit, updates the registry, and causes the minidriver to start monitoring the UPS unit.



## -syntax

````
DWORD UPSInit(
   void 
);
````


## -parameters

### -param  

None


## -returns
The <b>UPSInit</b> function returns one of the following DWORD values:
<dl>
<dt><b>UPS_INITOK</b></dt>
</dl>No errors were encountered during initialization. 
<dl>
<dt><b>UPS_INITREGISTRYERROR</b></dt>
</dl>An error occurred while accessing the registry.
<dl>
<dt><b>UPS_INITCOMMOPENERROR</b></dt>
</dl>An error occurred while opening the COM port.
<dl>
<dt><b>UPS_INITCOMMSETUPERROR</b></dt>
</dl>An error occurred while setting up the COM port.
<dl>
<dt><b>UPS_INITUNKNOWNERROR</b></dt>
</dl>An unidentified error occurred.

 


## -remarks
The <b>UPSInit</b> function is the first function exported by a UPS minidriver that is called by the UPS service. The function must complete all initialization operations for the minidriver, including the following:

Opening a communication path to the UPS unit

Determining the initial state of the UPS unit

Updating <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d0d4ef8f-9df1-48a3-b0fc-cea4eb3cdf40">UPS registry entries</a>


Beginning the monitoring of the UPS unit

If the <b>UPSInit</b> function returns a value other than UPS_INITOK, the UPS service immediately calls the <a href="..\upssvc\nf-upssvc-upsstop.md">UPSStop</a> function.
