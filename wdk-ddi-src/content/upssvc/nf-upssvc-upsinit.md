## Return Value

The <b>UPSInit</b> function returns one of the following DWORD values:

## Remarks

The <b>UPSInit</b> function is the first function exported by a UPS minidriver that is called by the UPS service. The function must complete all initialization operations for the minidriver, including the following:

<ul>
<li>
Opening a communication path to the UPS unit

</li>
<li>
Determining the initial state of the UPS unit

</li>
<li>
Updating <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d0d4ef8f-9df1-48a3-b0fc-cea4eb3cdf40">UPS registry entries</a>


</li>
<li>
Beginning the monitoring of the UPS unit

</li>
</ul>
If the <b>UPSInit</b> function returns a value other than UPS_INITOK, the UPS service immediately calls the <a href="..\upssvc\nf-upssvc-upsstop.md">UPSStop</a> function.
