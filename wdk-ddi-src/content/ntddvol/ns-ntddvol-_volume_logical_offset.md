# _VOLUME_LOGICAL_OFFSET structure
The VOLUME_LOGICAL_OFFSET structure contains a logical offset into a volume.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _VOLUME_LOGICAL_OFFSET {
  LONGLONG LogicalOffset;
} VOLUME_LOGICAL_OFFSET, *PVOLUME_LOGICAL_OFFSET;
````

## Members


`LogicalOffset`

Contains a logical offset in bytes into a volume.

## Remarks
The VOLUME_LOGICAL_OFFSET structure is used with <a href="..\ntddvol\ni-ntddvol-ioctl_volume_physical_to_logical.md">IOCTL_VOLUME_PHYSICAL_TO_LOGICAL</a> and <a href="..\ntddvol\ni-ntddvol-ioctl_volume_logical_to_physical.md">IOCTL_VOLUME_LOGICAL_TO_PHYSICAL</a> to request a logical offset equivalent of a physical offset or a physical offset equivalent of a logical offset, respectively.

## Requirements
