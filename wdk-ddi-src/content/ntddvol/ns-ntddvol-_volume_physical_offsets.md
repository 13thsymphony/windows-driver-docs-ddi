# _VOLUME_PHYSICAL_OFFSETS structure
The VOLUME_PHYSICAL_OFFSETS structure contains an array of physical offsets and accompanying physical disk numbers and is used with <a href="..\ntddvol\ni-ntddvol-ioctl_volume_logical_to_physical.md">IOCTL_VOLUME_LOGICAL_TO_PHYSICAL</a> to request a series of pairs of physical offsets and disk numbers that correspond to a single logical offset.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _VOLUME_PHYSICAL_OFFSETS {
  ULONG                  NumberOfPhysicalOffsets;
  VOLUME_PHYSICAL_OFFSET PhysicalOffset[ANYSIZE_ARRAY];
} VOLUME_PHYSICAL_OFFSETS, *PVOLUME_PHYSICAL_OFFSETS;
````

## Members


`NumberOfPhysicalOffsets`

Contains the number of physical offsets returned by the call to <a href="..\ntddvol\ni-ntddvol-ioctl_volume_logical_to_physical.md">IOCTL_VOLUME_LOGICAL_TO_PHYSICAL</a>.

`PhysicalOffset`

Contains an array of structures of type <a href="..\ntddvol\ns-ntddvol-_volume_physical_offset.md">VOLUME_PHYSICAL_OFFSET</a>. Each element of the array contains a pair consisting of a physical disk number and an accompanying physical offset &lt;disk number, disk offset&gt;.


## Requirements
