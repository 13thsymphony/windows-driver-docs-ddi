# IOCTL_VOLUME_READ_PLEX IOCTL
Performs a read on a specific <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/139a10e9-203b-499b-9291-8537eae9189c">plex</a> of a volume. Because all plexes are identical, the volume manager can retrieve data from any of a volume's plexes during a normal read operation. The volume manager spreads reads among a volume's plexes, to balance the I/O load on the physical media and to maximize read performance. 

If, however, an application or kernel-mode component must read data from a particular plex instead of letting the volume manager pick one, it can use this IOCTL to do so.

### Major Code
[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](xref:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control")

### Input Buffer
Caller inserts the <a href="..\ntddvol\ns-ntddvol-_volume_read_plex_input.md">VOLUME_READ_PLEX_INPUT</a> structure, containing the logical offset, at the beginning of the buffer at <b>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b>.

### Input Buffer Length
<b>
       Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> in the I/O stack location of the IRP indicates the size, in bytes, of the input buffer, which must be greater than or equal to the value of <b>sizeof</b>(VOLUME_READ_PLEX_INPUT).

### Output Buffer
Like <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549327">IRP_MJ_READ</a>, this IOCTL stores the read data in the memory buffer passed as a memory descriptor list (MDL) in the <b>Irp-&gt;MdlAddress</b> field.

### Output Buffer Length
The length of the buffer.

### Input / Output Buffer
<text></text>

### Input / Output Buffer Length
<text></text>

### Status Block
If the operation is successful, the volume manager sets the <b>Status</b> field to STATUS_SUCCESS.

The VOLUME_READ_PLEX_INPUT structure at <b>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> has a <b>Length</b> member that must be aligned on a 512-byte boundary. If <b>Length</b> does not have the proper alignment, the operation fails and the volume manager sets the <b>Status</b> field to VKE_EINVAL.
