# _VOLUME_PHYSICAL_OFFSET structure
The VOLUME_PHYSICAL_OFFSET structure contains a physical offset into a volume and its accompanying physical disk number and is used with <a href="..\ntddvol\ni-ntddvol-ioctl_volume_physical_to_logical.md">IOCTL_VOLUME_PHYSICAL_TO_LOGICAL</a> and <a href="..\ntddvol\ni-ntddvol-ioctl_volume_logical_to_physical.md">IOCTL_VOLUME_LOGICAL_TO_PHYSICAL</a> to request a logical offset equivalent of a physical offset or a physical offset equivalent of a logical offset, respectively.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _VOLUME_PHYSICAL_OFFSET {
  ULONG    DiskNumber;
  LONGLONG Offset;
} VOLUME_PHYSICAL_OFFSET, *PVOLUME_PHYSICAL_OFFSET;
````

## Members


`DiskNumber`

Contains the number of the physical disk.

`Offset`

Contains the physical offset in bytes of the data on the disk.
