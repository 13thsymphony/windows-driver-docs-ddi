# IOCTL_BTH_HCI_VENDOR_COMMAND IOCTL
The IOCTL_BTH_HCI_VENDOR_COMMAND request allows Bluetooth applications to send vendor-specific
     commands to radios.

### Major Code
[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](xref:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control")

### Input Buffer
The 
      <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member points to a 
      <a href="..\bthioctl\ns-bthioctl-_bth_vendor_specific_command.md">BTH_VENDOR_SPECIFIC_COMMAND</a> structure. The structure contains a manufacturer identifier, a link
      management protocol (LMP) version, an HCI command header, and the associated vendor command data that
      includes optional pattern data to match an event to the command.

### Input Buffer Length
The length of a 
      <a href="..\bthioctl\ns-bthioctl-_bth_vendor_specific_command.md">BTH_VENDOR_SPECIFIC_COMMAND</a> structure.

### Output Buffer
The <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member points to a buffer that contains the event data returned from the radio. The data is available in the <b>EventInfo</b> member of the <a href="..\bthioctl\ns-bthioctl-_bth_vendor_event_info.md">BTH_VENDOR_EVENT_INFO</a> structure.

The <b>EventSize</b> member provides the size of the vendor-specific event data returned from the radio.

### Output Buffer Length
The length of a <a href="..\bthioctl\ns-bthioctl-_bth_vendor_event_info.md">BTH_VENDOR_EVENT_INFO</a> structure.

### Status Block
I/O Status block
If the request is successful, the 
      <b>Information</b> member of the STATUS_BLOCK structure is set to the size, in bytes, of the buffer that
      holds the command response.

The 
      <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the values in the following table.

STATUS_SUCCESS

The IOCTL completed successfully.

STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL

The input buffer that was passed was too small.

STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER

The input buffer that was passed was invalid.

STATUS_PRIVILEGE_NOT_HELD

The caller does not have the required privileges.

STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES

There was insufficient memory available to process the request.

    ## Remarks
        The IOCTL_BTH_HCI_VENDOR_COMMAND request provides a mechanism that allows vendors to create commands
    that are specific to their Bluetooth radios.

The manufacturer ID and link management protocol (LMP) version values that are in the 
    <a href="..\bthioctl\ns-bthioctl-_bth_vendor_specific_command.md">
    BTH_VENDOR_SPECIFIC_COMMAND</a> structure help to prevent the sending of vendor-specific commands to
    the wrong radio. The LMP version enables the vendors to send vendor-specific commands to radios that have
    a matching LMP version. If the LMP version is zero, all radios from that vendor will receive the
    vendor-specific command.

Patterns are required if a vendor-specific command does not follow the standard HCI flow control and a
    vendor-specific event is generated in response to the vendor-specific command.

If patterns are required, the command should be followed by 
    <a href="..\bthioctl\ns-bthioctl-_bth_vendor_pattern.md">BTH_VENDOR_PATTERN</a> structures for patterns
    that are present in the event. These patterns allow the Bluetooth driver stack to match vendor-specific
    events with the corresponding vendor-specific commands.

The BTH_VENDOR_PATTERN structure specifies such patterns that follow the vendor-specific command data
    that is specified in the 
    <b>Data</b> member of BTH_VENDOR_SPECIFIC_COMMAND structure. The maximum total size of all the patterns
    that follow the command should not be greater than 255.

The event that is generated because of this command is copied into the output buffer (including the
    event header).
