# _BTH_SDP_CONNECT structure
The BTH_SDP_CONNECT structure contains input and output information about a connection between the
  local Bluetooth system and a remote SDP server. This structure is passed as the input buffer and output
  buffer of 
  <a href="..\bthioctl\ni-bthioctl-ioctl_bth_sdp_connect.md">IOCTL_BTH_SDP_CONNECT</a>.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _BTH_SDP_CONNECT {
  BTH_ADDR   bthAddress;
  ULONG      fSdpConnect;
  HANDLE_SDP hConnection;
  UCHAR      requestTimeout;
} BTH_SDP_CONNECT, *PBTH_SDP_CONNECT;
````

## Members


`bthAddress`

The address of the remote SDP server that the local system connects to. This address cannot be to
     the local radio.

`fSdpConnect`

A flag or combination of flags that determines how to handle the connection request. Valid flag
     values are listed in the following table.
     
<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
SDP_CONNECT_ALLOW_PIN

</td>
<td>
If requested, perform a pin exchange with the remote device.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
SDP_CONNECT_CACHE

</td>
<td>
Requests are serviced out of the local cache of the SDP record.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`HANDLE_SDP_FIELD_NAME`



`requestTimeout`

The timeout, in seconds, for requests to the SDP connection handle that is returned in the 
     <b>hConnection</b> member. If the request times out, the SDP connection returned in 
     <b>hConnection</b> must be closed. The values for this field are bound by SDP_REQUEST_TO_MIN and
     SDP_REQUEST_TO_MAX. If SDP_REQUEST_TO_DEFAULT is specified, the timeout is 30 seconds.
