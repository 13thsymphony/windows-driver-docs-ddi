# IOCTL_BTH_SDP_SUBMIT_RECORD IOCTL
The IOCTL_BTH_SDP_SUBMIT_RECORD request allows a profile driver to add an SDP record to the local SDP
     server, allowing the client to advertise that a service is available on the local computer. The profile
     driver calls 
     <a href="..\bthioctl\ni-bthioctl-ioctl_bth_sdp_remove_record.md">IOCTL_BTH_SDP_REMOVE_RECORD</a> to
     stop advertising the server on the local SDP server.



The IOCTL_BTH_SDP_SUBMIT_RECORD request allows a profile driver to add an SDP record to the local SDP
     server, allowing the client to advertise that a service is available on the local computer. The profile
     driver calls 
     <a href="..\bthioctl\ni-bthioctl-ioctl_bth_sdp_remove_record.md">IOCTL_BTH_SDP_REMOVE_RECORD</a> to
     stop advertising the server on the local SDP server.

### Major Code
[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](xref:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control")

### Input Buffer
The 
      <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member specifies the raw SDP stream that contains the record to
      advertise.

### Input Buffer Length
The length of the stream.

### Output Buffer
The 
      <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member points to a buffer that holds a handle to the SDP record. This
      handle can only be used by IOCTL_BTH_SDP_REMOVE_RECORD to remove the record submitted by
      IOCTL_BTH_SDP_SUBMIT_RECORD.

### Output Buffer Length
The length of the buffer.

### Input / Output Buffer
<text></text>

### Input / Output Buffer Length
<text></text>

### Status Block
I/O Status block
If the request is successful, the 
      <b>Information</b> member of the STATUS_BLOCK structure is set to the size, in bytes, of the handle that
      the IOCTL returns. Otherwise, the 
      <b>Information</b> member is set to zero.

The 
      <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the values in the following table.

STATUS_SUCCESS

The IOCTL completed successfully.

STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES

Not enough memory was allocated to process this request.

STATUS_INVALID_BUFFER_SIZE

The output buffer was sized incorrectly.

STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER

The stream passed to the input buffer was invalid.
