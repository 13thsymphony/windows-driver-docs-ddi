# IOCTL_BTH_DISCONNECT_DEVICE IOCTL



## -description

Profile drivers use IOCTL_BTH_DISCONNECT_DEVICE to request the operating system to disconnect the
     specified remote device.



Profile drivers use IOCTL_BTH_DISCONNECT_DEVICE to request the operating system to disconnect the
     specified remote device.



## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
The 
      <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member contains the address of the remote device to disconnect
      from.


### -input-buffer-length
The length of the address in the buffer.


### -output-buffer
None.


### -output-buffer-length
None.


### -in-out-buffer

<text></text>

### -inout-buffer-length

<text></text>

### -status-block
I/O Status block
The 
      <b>Information</b> member of the STATUS_BLOCK structure is set to zero because the Bluetooth driver
      stack returns no data with this IOCTL.

The 
      <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the values in the following table.

STATUS_SUCCESS

The IOCTL completed successfully.

STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_CONNECTED

The specified remote device is not connected.

Â 


## -remarks
Calling IOCTL_BTH_DISCONNECT_DEVICE forces a disconnect from the remote device without regard to the
    state of any L2CAP and SCO connections. All active SCO connections will be disconnected before the ACL
    connection is disconnected. Pending data transfers might fail.
