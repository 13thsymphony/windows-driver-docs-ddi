# IOCTL_BTH_SDP_REMOVE_RECORD IOCTL



## -description

The IOCTL_BTH_SDP_REMOVE_RECORD request removes a local SDP record that the profile driver previously
     submitted. The local server will no longer offer this record to remote devices.



The IOCTL_BTH_SDP_REMOVE_RECORD request removes a local SDP record that the profile driver previously
     submitted. The local server will no longer offer this record to remote devices.



## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
The 
      <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member contains an SDP connection handle from which to remove the SDP
      record. This must be a handle returned from a call to 
      <a href="..\bthioctl\ni-bthioctl-ioctl_bth_sdp_submit_record.md">IOCTL_BTH_SDP_SUBMIT_RECORD</a> or 
      <a href="..\bthioctl\ni-bthioctl-ioctl_bth_sdp_submit_record_with_info.md">
      IOCTL_BTH_SDP_SUBMIT_RECORD_WITH_INFO</a>. Handles from other sources are invalid in this
      context.


### -input-buffer-length
The length of the buffer.


### -output-buffer
None.


### -output-buffer-length
None.


### -in-out-buffer

<text></text>

### -inout-buffer-length

<text></text>

### -status-block
I/O Status block
The 
      <b>Information</b> member of the STATUS_BLOCK structure is set to zero.

The 
      <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the values in the following table.

STATUS_SUCCESS

The IOCTL completed successfully.

STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_CONNECTED

The remote SDP server is disconnected.

STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER

The SDP connection handle passed in the input buffer is invalid.

STATUS_NOT_FOUND

The SDP connection handle passed in the input buffer was not found.

 


## -remarks
If the record to be removed was published using IOCTL_BTH_SDP_SUBMIT_RECORD_WITH_INFO, this indicates
    that class of device (CoD) bits were set. In this case, calling IOCTL_BTH_SDP_REMOVE_RECORD might cause
    the CoD bits to be cleared. The bits will remain set if another client has set them but has not called
    this IOCTL.
