# _BTH_DEVICE_INFO_LIST structure
The BTH_DEVICE_INFO_LIST structure contains output information about all cached, previously
  discovered remote devices.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _BTH_DEVICE_INFO_LIST {
  ULONG           numOfDevices;
  BTH_DEVICE_INFO deviceList[1];
} BTH_DEVICE_INFO_LIST, *PBTH_DEVICE_INFO_LIST;
````

## Members


`deviceList`

An open-ended array of 
     <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=50713">BTH_DEVICE_INFO</a> structures. Each
     structure contains information about a previously discovered remote device.

`numOfDevices`

The number of devices that have been discovered.

## Remarks
The 
    <a href="..\bthioctl\ni-bthioctl-ioctl_bth_get_device_info.md">IOCTL_BTH_GET_DEVICE_INFO</a> call's
    output buffer contains the list of all cached, previously discovered remote devices.

The 
    <b>numOfDevices</b> member of the BTH_DEVICE_INFO_LIST structure returns the total number of
    BTH_DEVICE_INFO structures available. If the calling driver passes in a smaller buffer, only a portion of
    the available structures will be returned.

## Requirements

| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows version** | Versions:\_Supported in Windows Vista, and later. Versions:\_Supported in Windows Vista, and later. |
