# _BTH_VENDOR_SPECIFIC_COMMAND structure
The BTH_VENDOR_SPECIFIC_COMMAND structure specifies a Bluetooth vendor-specific command.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _BTH_VENDOR_SPECIFIC_COMMAND {
  ULONG              ManufacturerId;
  UCHAR              LmpVersion;
  BOOLEAN            MatchAnySinglePattern;
  BTH_COMMAND_HEADER HciHeader;
  UCHAR              Data[1];
} BTH_VENDOR_SPECIFIC_COMMAND, *PBTH_VENDOR_SPECIFIC_COMMAND;
````

## Members


`Data`

A UCHAR array that contains the data and patterns for the command that is specified in the 
     <b>HciHeader</b> member. Patterns are specified with 
     <a href="..\bthioctl\ns-bthioctl-_bth_vendor_pattern.md">BTH_VENDOR_PATTERN</a> structures.

`HciHeader`

A 
     <a href="..\bthioctl\ns-bthioctl-_bth_command_header.md">BTH_COMMAND_HEADER</a> structure that
     contains information about the vendor-specific command that includes an operation code and buffer
     length. The buffer length should only include the size of the data to be sent to the radio. It should
     not include the size of the patterns.

`LmpVersion`

A UCHAR that contains the link management protocol (LMP) version. If the LMP version of a radio is
     greater than this value, the command is sent to the radio. Otherwise, the radio does not receive the
     command. If 
     <b>LmpVersion</b> is zero, all radios will receive the vendor-specific command.

`ManufacturerId`

The manufacturer identifier of the radio. Radios that have this manufacturer identifier can
     receive the vendor-specific command.

`MatchAnySinglePattern`

A BOOLEAN value that specifies if all the patterns in the 
     <b>Data</b> member must match or only one pattern must match to associate an event with a vendor-specific
     command. If there are no patterns that are associated with a vendor-specific command, this member is
     ignored. If 
     <b>MatchAnySinglePattern</b> is <b>FALSE</b>, all the patterns must match to associate an event with the
     command. If 
     <b>MatchAnySinglePattern</b> is <b>TRUE</b>, matching any pattern associates an event with the command.

## Remarks
This BTH_VENDOR_SPECIFIC_COMMAND structure specifies the input buffer for the 
    <mshelp:link keywords="bltooth.ioctl_bth_hci_vendor_command" tabindex="0"><b>
    IOCTL_BTH_HCI_VENDOR_COMMAND</b></mshelp:link> IOCTL. This IOCTL can be used to send vendor-specific commands to
    Bluetooth radios.

To specify the size of the HCI command data, use the
    <b>TotalParameterLength</b> member in the 
    <a href="..\bthioctl\ns-bthioctl-_bth_command_header.md">BTH_COMMAND_HEADER</a> structure in the
    BTH_VENDOR_SPECIFIC_COMMAND structure's 
    <b>HciHeader</b> member.

Patterns are required if a vendor-specific command does not follow the standard HCI flow control and a
    vendor-specific event is generated in response to the vendor-specific command.

If patterns are required, the patterns follow the data to be sent to the radio in the 
    <b>Data</b> member buffer. Each pattern begins with a 
    <a href="..\bthioctl\ns-bthioctl-_bth_vendor_pattern.md">BTH_VENDOR_PATTERN</a> structure.

If such patterns are specified, the 
    <b>TotalParameterLength</b> member should not include the size of the patterns.

## Requirements

| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows Driver kit version** |  |
