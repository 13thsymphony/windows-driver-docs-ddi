# _BTH_VENDOR_EVENT_INFO structure
The BTH_VENDOR_EVENT_INFO structure specifies the buffer that is associated with the
  GUID_BLUETOOTH_HCI_VENDOR_EVENT GUID.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _BTH_VENDOR_EVENT_INFO {
  BTH_ADDR BthAddress;
  ULONG    EventSize;
  UCHAR    EventInfo[1];
} BTH_VENDOR_EVENT_INFO, *PBTH_VENDOR_EVENT_INFO;
````

## Members


`BthAddress`

The address of the local radio that is associated with the event.

`EventInfo`

A UCHAR array for the event buffer. The buffer includes the event header.

`EventSize`

The size, in bytes, of the event buffer. The size includes the event header.

## Remarks
The BTH_VENDOR_EVENT_INFO structure contains data that is associated with a
    GUID_BLUETOOTH_HCI_VENDOR_EVENT event.

An application or driver that registers for notifications for the GUID_BTHPORT_DEVICE_INTERFACE GUID
    receives the WM_DEVICECHANGE message that has 
    <i>wParam</i> set to DBT_CUSTOMEVENT and the event GUID set to GUID_BLUETOOTH_HCI_VENDOR_EVENT.
