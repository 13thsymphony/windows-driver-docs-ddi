# IOCTL_BTH_SDP_SERVICE_ATTRIBUTE_SEARCH IOCTL
The IOCTL_BTH_SDP_SERVICE_ATTRIBUTE_SEARCH request combines an SDP service and attribute search into
     a single operation. This allows a caller to directly obtain SDP records from a remote device.

### Major Code
[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](xref:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control")

### Input Buffer
The 
      <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member contains an 
      <b>
      IOCTL_BTH_SDP_SERVICE_ATTRIBUTE_SEARCH</b> structure that specifies the connection handle to the
      remote SDP server, an array of GUIDs, and the range of attribute values to search for.

### Input Buffer Length
The length of an 
      <b>
      IOCTL_BTH_SDP_SERVICE_ATTRIBUTE_SEARCH</b> structure.

### Output Buffer
The 
      <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member points to a buffer that holds a 
      <a href="..\bthioctl\ns-bthioctl-_bth_sdp_stream_response.md">BTH_SDP_STREAM_RESPONSE</a> structure
      followed by a raw SDP record stream.

### Output Buffer Length
The length of a 
      <a href="..\bthioctl\ns-bthioctl-_bth_sdp_stream_response.md">BTH_SDP_STREAM_RESPONSE</a> structure.

### Input / Output Buffer
<text></text>

### Input / Output Buffer Length
<text></text>

### Status Block
If the request is successful, the 
      <b>Information</b> member of the STATUS_BLOCK structure is set to the size, in bytes, of the SDP
      response stream or the size of the output buffer, whichever is smaller. Otherwise, the 
      <b>Information</b> member is set to zero.

The 
      <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the values in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Status value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STATUS_SUCCESS

</td>
<td>
The IOCTL completed successfully.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_CONNECTED

</td>
<td>
The device on which the SDP service resides was not connected.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES

</td>
<td>
There was not enough memory to complete this operation.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STATUS_INVALID_BUFFER_SIZE

</td>
<td>
The output buffer was sized incorrectly.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER

</td>
<td>
One of the values in the input buffer was not valid.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STATUS_REQUEST_NOT_ACCEPTED

</td>
<td>
The SDP service rejected the request.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STATUS_TOO_MANY_GUIDS_REQUESTED

</td>
<td>
The SDP service could not process the number of GUIDs passed in the input buffer.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks
After a profile driver obtains an SDP record, it can use SDP functions to parse them. Pointers to
    these functions are provided by the 
    <a href="..\bthsdpddi\ns-bthsdpddi-_bthddi_sdp_parse_interface.md">
    BTHDDI_SDP_PARSE_INTERFACE</a> interface.
