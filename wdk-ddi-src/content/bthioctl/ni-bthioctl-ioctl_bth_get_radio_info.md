# IOCTL_BTH_GET_RADIO_INFO IOCTL



## -description

The IOCTL_BTH_GET_RADIO_INFO request obtains information about the specified remote radio.



The IOCTL_BTH_GET_RADIO_INFO request obtains information about the specified remote radio.



## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
The 
      <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member specifies the Bluetooth address of the remote radio to
      query.


### -input-buffer-length
The length of the buffer.


### -output-buffer
The 
      <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member points to a buffer that holds a 
      <a href="..\bthioctl\ns-bthioctl-_bth_radio_info.md">BTH_RADIO_INFO</a> structure. This structure
      contains information about the remote radio's feature support for the Link Management Protocol (LMP),
      the radio's manufacturer ID, and its LMP version.


### -output-buffer-length
The length of a 
      <a href="..\bthioctl\ns-bthioctl-_bth_radio_info.md">BTH_RADIO_INFO</a> structure. 


### -in-out-buffer

<text></text>

### -inout-buffer-length

<text></text>

### -status-block
I/O Status block
If the request is successful, the 
      <b>Information</b> member of the STATUS_BLOCK structure is set to the size, in bytes, of the output
      buffer. Otherwise, the 
      <b>Information</b> member is set to zero.

The 
      <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the values in the following table.

STATUS_SUCCESS

The IOCTL completed successfully.

STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_CONNECTED

The device object for the specified device was not connected.

 


## -remarks
The IOCTL_BTH_GET_RADIO_INFO IOCTL returns similar information as the IOCTL_BTH_GET_LOCAL_INFO IOCTL,
    but for a remote Bluetooth radio.
