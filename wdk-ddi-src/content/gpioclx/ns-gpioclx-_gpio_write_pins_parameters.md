# _GPIO_WRITE_PINS_PARAMETERS structure
The <b>GPIO_WRITE_PINS_PARAMETERS</b> structure describes a write operation on a group of general-purpose I/O (GPIO) pins.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _GPIO_WRITE_PINS_PARAMETERS {
  BANK_ID               BankId;
  PPIN_NUMBER           PinNumberTable;
  ULONG                 PinCount;
  PVOID                 Buffer;
  GPIO_WRITE_PINS_FLAGS Flags;
  PVOID                 Reserved;
} GPIO_WRITE_PINS_PARAMETERS, *PGPIO_WRITE_PINS_PARAMETERS;
````

## Members


`BankId`

The identifier for the bank of GPIO pins that contains the pins to write to. If N is the number of banks in the GPIO controller, <b>BankId</b> is an integer in the range 0 to N–1. The GPIO framework extension (GpioClx) previously obtained the number of banks in the controller from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439399">CLIENT_QueryControllerBasicInformation</a> event callback function. For more information, see Remarks in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439358">CLIENT_CONTROLLER_BASIC_INFORMATION</a>.

`Buffer`

A pointer to a buffer that contains the bit values that this callback function is to write to the GPIO pins that are identified in the <b>PinNumberTable</b> array. The function writes bit 0 (the least significant bit) from the buffer to the GPIO pin that is identified by array element 0, writes bit 1 from the buffer to the pin identified by array element 1, and so on.

`Flags`

A set of flags to control the GPIO pin write operation. No flags are currently defined for this operation.

`PinCount`

The number of elements in the <b>PinNumberTable</b> array.

`PinNumberTable`

A pointer to an array of bank-relative PIN_NUMBER values. Each array element specifies the number of a GPIO pin to write to. If this bank has N pins, the pins are numbered 0 to N–1. The number of elements in this array is specified by the <b>PinCount</b> member.

`Reserved`

Reserved for system use.

## Remarks
The <i>WriteParameters</i> parameter of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439439">CLIENT_WriteGpioPins</a> event callback function is a pointer to a caller-allocated <b>GPIO_WRITE_PINS_PARAMETERS</b> structure. All of the pins that this function writes to are part of the same bank of GPIO pins.
