# GPIO_CLIENT_PRE_PROCESS_CONTROLLER_INTERRUPT function



## -description
The <i>CLIENT_PreProcessControllerInterrupt</i> event callback function performs any pre-processing of a general-purpose I/O (GPIO) interrupt that must be done immediately if the ISR is scheduled to run at a later time.



## -syntax

````
GPIO_CLIENT_PRE_PROCESS_CONTROLLER_INTERRUPT CLIENT_PreProcessControllerInterrupt;

NTSTATUS CLIENT_PreProcessControllerInterrupt(
  _In_ PVOID   Context,
  _In_ BANK_ID BankId
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param Context [in]

A pointer to the GPIO controller driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4BE99C71-9BA6-44E3-A54F-DE8C3440A474">device context</a>.


### -param BankId [in]

The bank that contains the interrupting GPIO pin. If N is the number of banks in the GPIO controller, <b>BankId</b> is an integer in the range 0 to N–1. The GPIO framework extension previously obtained the number of banks in the controller from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439399">CLIENT_QueryControllerBasicInformation</a> event callback function. For more information, see Remarks in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439358">CLIENT_CONTROLLER_BASIC_INFORMATION</a>.


## -returns
The <i>CLIENT_PreProcessControllerInterrupt</i> function returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call is successful. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate error code.


## -remarks
This callback function is optional. A GPIO controller driver implements this function only if it performs most of its interrupt handling at PASSIVE_LEVEL, but must do some initial processing of an interrupt at DIRQL.

Typically, a GPIO controller driver can access a memory-mapped GPIO controller at DIRQL, but can access a serially connected GPIO controller only at PASSIVE_LEVEL. However, some serially connected GPIO controllers might lose interrupt status data if they delay capture of the interrupt status bits until the IRQL drops to PASSIVE_LEVEL. When the IRQL later drops to PASSIVE_LEVEL, the GPIO framework extension (GpioClx) can call the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439395">CLIENT_QueryActiveInterrupts</a> callback function to retrieve the register contents.

The GPIO controller driver indicates whether it must handle interrupts at PASSIVE_LEVEL in the device information that it passes to GpioClx during the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439399">CLIENT_QueryControllerBasicInformation</a> callback. If the GPIO controller is memory-mapped, so that the driver can access the controller's registers at DIRQL, the driver sets the <b>MemoryMappedController</b> flag bit in the <b>Flags</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439358">CLIENT_CONTROLLER_BASIC_INFORMATION</a> structure that the driver passes to GpioClx. Otherwise, the driver sets <b>MemoryMappedController</b> = 0 to indicate that the driver must handle interrupts at PASSIVE_LEVEL. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/E7556046-D85C-4CD1-8C27-578BF5CAFF2B">Passive-Level ISRs</a>.

To register your driver's <i>CLIENT_PreProcessControllerInterrupt</i> callback function, call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439490">GPIO_CLX_RegisterClient</a> method. This method accepts, as an input parameter, a pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439479">GPIO_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_PACKET</a> structure that contains a <i>CLIENT_PreProcessControllerInterrupt</i> function pointer.

To define a <i>CLIENT_PreProcessControllerInterrupt</i> callback function, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of callback function you're defining. Windows provides a set of callback function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the callback function types helps <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2F3549EF-B50F-455A-BDC7-1F67782B8DCA">Code Analysis for Drivers</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/74feeb16-387c-4796-987a-aff3fb79b556">Static Driver Verifier</a> (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it's a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

For example, to define a <i>CLIENT_PreProcessControllerInterrupt</i> callback function that is named <code>MyEvtGpioPreProcessInterrupt</code>, use the GPIO_CLIENT_PRE_PROCESS_CONTROLLER_INTERRUPT function type, as shown in this code example:

Then, implement your callback function as follows:

The GPIO_CLIENT_PRE_PROCESS_CONTROLLER_INTERRUPT function type is defined in the Gpioclx.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation to your function definition. The _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the GPIO_CLIENT_PRE_PROCESS_CONTROLLER_INTERRUPT function type in the header file are used. For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/73a408ba-0219-4fde-8dad-ca330e4e67c3">Declaring Functions by Using Function Role Types for KMDF Drivers</a>.
