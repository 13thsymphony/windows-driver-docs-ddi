# GPIO_CLIENT_START_CONTROLLER function
The <i>CLIENT_StartController</i> event callback function performs operations that are needed when the general-purpose I/O (GPIO) controller device enters the D0 power state.

## Syntax

```
GPIO_CLIENT_START_CONTROLLER GpioClientStartController;

NTSTATUS GpioClientStartController(
  PVOID Context,
  BOOLEAN RestoreContext,
  WDF_POWER_DEVICE_STATE PreviousPowerState
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Context`

A pointer to the GPIO controller driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4BE99C71-9BA6-44E3-A54F-DE8C3440A474">device context</a>.

`RestoreContext`

Whether the client driver should restore the GPIO controller to a previously saved hardware context. If TRUE, the hardware context should be restored. If FALSE, the hardware context should not be restored. For more information, see Remarks.

`PreviousPowerState`

The previous device power state. This parameter is a <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ne-wudfddi_types-_wdf_power_device_state.md">WDF_POWER_DEVICE_STATE</a> enumeration value that specifies the low-power state from which the device entered the D0 power state. The GPIO controller driver can use this information to determine how to configure the controller device so that it is ready to use.


## Return Value

The <i>CLIENT_StartController</i> function returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call is successful. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate error code.

## Remarks

This callback function is implemented by the GPIO controller driver. The GPIO framework extension (GpioClx) calls this function to place the GPIO controller device in a known, initial state at system startup or when the device transitions from a low-power state to a working state. This callback function must perform any operations that are necessary after the device wakes from a low-power state, such as restoring any information that the driver needs after the device enters the D0 power state.

Typically, a <i>CLIENT_StartController</i> callback function sets all the GPIO pins to their default state.

To register your driver's <i>CLIENT_StartController</i> callback function, call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439490">GPIO_CLX_RegisterClient</a> method. This method accepts, as an input parameter, a pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439479">GPIO_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_PACKET</a> structure that contains a <i>CLIENT_StartController</i> function pointer.

Although the <i>CLIENT_StartController</i> callback function is called at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL, you should not make this function <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/creating-pageable-code-in-a-kmdf-driver">pageable</a>. The <i>CLIENT_StartController</i> callback is in the critical timing path for restoring power to the devices in the hardware platform and, for performance reasons, it should not be delayed by page faults.
