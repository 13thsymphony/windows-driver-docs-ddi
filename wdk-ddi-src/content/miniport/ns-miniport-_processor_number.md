# _PROCESSOR_NUMBER structure
The <b>PROCESSOR_NUMBER</b> structure identifies a processor by its group number and group-relative processor number.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct _PROCESSOR_NUMBER {
  USHORT Group;
  UCHAR  Number;
  UCHAR  Reserved;
} *PPROCESSOR_NUMBER, PROCESSOR_NUMBER;
```

## Members


`Group`

The group number. If multiprocessor system contains <i>n</i> groups, the groups are numbered from 0 to <i>n</i>-1.

`Number`

The group-relative processor number. If a group contains <i>m</i> logical processors, the processors are numbered from 0 to <i>m</i>-1.

`Reserved`

Reserved for future use. Initialize to zero.

## Remarks
Windows 7 is the first version of Windows to support processor groups. In Windows 7, only 64-bit versions of Windows support multiple groups; 32-bit versions of Windows support only one group. If a multiprocessor system is running a 64-bit version of Windows and contains no more than 64 logical processors, Windows assigns all processors to group 0. A multiprocessor system that is running a 32-bit version of Windows can contain no more than 32 processors.

In Windows 7, the maximum number of groups in a multiprocessor system is four, but this value might change in future versions of Windows. The safest way to determine the maximum number of groups in Windows 7 or a later version of Windows is to call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553035">KeQueryMaximumGroupCount</a> routine. Kernel-mode drivers that call <b>KeQueryMaximumGroupCount</b> will not require code changes if the formula that is used to calculate the maximum number of groups changes in a future version of Windows.

Kernel-mode routines that use the <b>PROCESSOR_NUMBER</b> structure include <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552076">KeGetCurrentProcessorNumberEx</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552096">KeGetProcessorIndexFromNumber</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552100">KeGetProcessorNumberFromIndex</a>, and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553031">KeQueryLogicalProcessorRelationship</a>.
