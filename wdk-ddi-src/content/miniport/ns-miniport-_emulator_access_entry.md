# _EMULATOR_ACCESS_ENTRY structure
The EMULATOR_ACCESS_ENTRY structure specifies an element in the <b>EmulatorAccessEntries</b> array set up in the VIDEO_PORT_CONFIG_INFO structure by drivers of VGA-compatible (SVGA) adapters on x86-based NT-based operating system platforms.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _EMULATOR_ACCESS_ENTRY {
  ULONG                     BasePort;
  ULONG                     NumConsecutivePorts;
  EMULATOR_PORT_ACCESS_TYPE AccessType;
  UCHAR                     AccessMode;
  UCHAR                     StringSupport;
  PVOID                     Routine;
} EMULATOR_ACCESS_ENTRY, *PEMULATOR_ACCESS_ENTRY;
````

## Members


`AccessMode`

Specifies how the given I/O port can be accessed as one or a combination (ORed) of the following values:


<dl>
<dt>EMULATOR_READ_ACCESS</dt>
<dt>EMULATOR_WRITE_ACCESS</dt>
</dl>


The I/O port range must be accessible in at least one of the preceding modes.

`AccessType`

Specifies the size of the data transferred through the given I/O port as one of <b>Uchar</b>, <b>Ulong</b>, or <b>Ushort</b>.

`BasePort`

Specifies the bus-relative physical address of the I/O port or ports to be hooked out by the V86 emulator. This value and the range of ports must fall within an access range of I/O ports already claimed in the registry by <b>VideoPortGetAccessRanges</b> or <b>VideoPortVerifyAccessRanges</b>.

`NumConsecutivePorts`

Specifies the number of consecutive ports to be hooked by the V86 emulator, starting at <b>BasePort</b>. This value is determined by the width of each hooked I/O port. For example, if port addresses 0x3C0 and 0x3C1 are hooked as a single USHORT-addressable port, this value should be 1.

`Routine`

Pointer to the miniport driver's <i>SvgaHwIoPortXxx</i> that handles accesses to the port or ports described in this structure.

`StringSupport`

Indicates whether the driver-supplied <i>SvgaHwIoPortXxx</i> function supports string accesses in cases where many values of the given <b>AccessType</b> are "pumped" through an I/O port consecutively. If this member is set to <b>TRUE</b>, the <b>Routine</b> member must specify the entry point of a miniport driver-supplied<i> SvgaHwIoPortXxxString</i> function.

## Remarks
VGA-compatible miniport drivers of SVGA video hardware in x86-based machines must define emulator access ranges, which a VGA-compatible miniport driver can set up with <b>VideoPortSetTrappedEmulatorPorts</b> to be accessed directly from full-screen MS-DOS applications for faster I/O. Such a driver must supply a set of <i>SvgaHwIoPortXxx</i> functions to validate any sequence of application-issued <b>IN</b>s, <b>INSB/INSW/INSD</b>s, <b>OUT</b>s, and/or <b>OUTSB/OUTSW/OUTSD</b>s to each such I/O port range.

Data in each EMULATOR_ACCESS_ENTRY-type element is used to determine which I/O ports (memory locations at which adapter registers are accessible) in the miniport driver's access ranges have been taken over (hooked out) by the V86 emulator on x86-based platforms. Values written to these locations by full-screen MS-DOS applications are trapped and forwarded to the miniport driver's corresponding <i>SvgaHwIoPortXxx</i> function for validation before they are written to or read from the video adapter. However, the miniport driver can enable the application to directly access particular I/O port ranges by calling <b>VideoPortSetTrappedEmulatorPorts</b> to improve performance.
