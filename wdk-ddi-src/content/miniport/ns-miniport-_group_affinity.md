# _GROUP_AFFINITY structure
The <b>GROUP_AFFINITY</b> structure specifies a group number and the processor <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4ef14b5b-128b-4b7c-9211-116e8bd60cab">affinity</a> within that group.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _GROUP_AFFINITY {
  KAFFINITY Mask;
  WORD      Group;
  WORD      Reserved[3];
} GROUP_AFFINITY, *PGROUP_AFFINITY;
````

## Members


`Group`

Specifies the group number. In Windows 7, the group number must be in the range from 0 to 3.

`Mask`

Specifies the affinity mask. This parameter is a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551830">KAFFINITY</a> value. The bits in the affinity mask identify a set of processors within the group identified by <b>Group</b>.

`Reserved`

Reserved for future use. Set all three <b>Reserved</b> array elements to zero.

## Remarks
This structure describes a group-specific affinity.

A <b>GROUP_AFFINITY</b> structure can describe a thread affinity, which is a set of processors on which a thread is allowed to run. All of the processors in this set belong to the group that is identified by the <b>Group</b> member of the structure. The <b>Mask</b> member contains an affinity mask that identifies the processors in the set. For example, the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-kesetsystemgroupaffinitythread.md">KeSetSystemGroupAffinityThread</a> and <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-kereverttousergroupaffinitythread.md">KeRevertToUserGroupAffinityThread</a> routines use <b>GROUP_AFFINITY</b> structures to specify thread affinities.

A <b>GROUP_AFFINITY</b> structure can describe an interrupt affinity, which is a set of processors on which an interrupt service routine can receive interrupts. For example, the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iogetdevicenumanode.md">IoGetDeviceNumaNode</a> routine uses <b>GROUP_AFFINITY</b> structures to specify interrupt affinities.

## Requirements
