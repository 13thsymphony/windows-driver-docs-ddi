# UrsReportHardwareEvent function
Notifies the USB dual-role class extension about a new hardware event.

## Syntax

````
FORCEINLINE NTSTATUS UrsReportHardwareEvent(
  _In_ WDFDEVICE          Device,
  _In_ URS_HARDWARE_EVENT HardwareEvent
);
````

## Parameters

`Device`

A handle to the framework device object that the client driver retrieved in the previous call to <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicecreate.md">WdfDeviceCreate</a>.

`HardwareEvent`

A <a href="..\urstypes\ne-urstypes-_urs_hardware_event.md">URS_HARDWARE_EVENT</a>-type value that indicates the type of event that occurred.


## Return Value

The method returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this method might return an appropriate <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7792201b-63bb-4db5-803d-2af02893d505">NTSTATUS</a> error code.

## Remarks

Before reporting any hardware events, the client driver for the dual-role controller must indicate to the class extension that the driver supports hardware events by calling <a href="..\ursdevice\nf-ursdevice-urssethardwareeventsupport.md">UrsSetHardwareEventSupport</a>.

The client driver cannot pass <b>UrsHardwareEventNone</b> as the <i>HardwareEvent</i> parameter value. That value is reserved for internal use.

The client driver must call this method to report any hardware event, such as ID-pin interrupts. Typically, in the driver's implementation of the <a href="..\wdfinterrupt\nc-wdfinterrupt-evt_wdf_interrupt_isr.md">EvtInterruptIsr</a> callback, the driver reads the  ID-pin state and reports the event to the class extension by calling this method.
