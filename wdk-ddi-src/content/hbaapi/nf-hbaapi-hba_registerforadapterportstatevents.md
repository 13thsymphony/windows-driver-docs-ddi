# HBA_RegisterForAdapterPortStatEvents function
The <b>HBA_RegisterForAdapterPortStatEvents</b> routine registers the indicated user callback routine to call when a port statistics event occurs.

## Syntax

````
HBA_STATUS HBA_API HBA_RegisterForAdapterPortStatEvents(
   HBA_PORTSTAT_CALLBACK callback,
   void                  *userData,
   HBA_HANDLE            handle,
   HBA_WWN               PortWWN,
   PHBA_PORTSTATISTICS   stats,
   HBA_UINT32            statType,
   HBA_CALLBACKHANDLE    *callbackHandle
);
````

## Parameters

`callback`

Pointer to a callback routine of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557117">HBA_PORTSTAT_CALLBACK</a> that is called when an adapter is added to the system.

`pUserData`

TBD

`Handle`

TBD

`PortWWN`

Contains a 64-bit worldwide name (WWN) that uniquely identifies the HBA port from which port events are reported. For a discussion of worldwide names, see the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API</i> specification.

`stats`

Pointer to a structure of type <a href="..\hbaapi\ns-hbaapi-hba_portstatistics.md">HBA_PortStatistics</a> that, on input, holds the statistical levels that determine when port statistics events are generated. On output, this member holds statistical data gathered for the port referenced by <i>PortWWN. </i>

`statType`

Holds a value that indicates the mechanism used to trigger port statistics events. If the value is HBA_EVENT_PORT_STAT_THRESHOLD, then each non-NULL member of the HBA_PortStatistics structure pointed to by <i>stats </i>will indicate the threshold at which an event is generated for that particular statistical parameter. For example, if the <b>TxWords</b> member of the HBA_PortStatistics structure holds a value of 1,000,000, then an event will be generated once 1,000,000 words have been transmitted.

If the value of <i>statType </i>is HBA_EVENT_PORT_STAT_GROWTH, then the values in the HBA_PortStatistics structure will be interpreted as growth-rate numbers. The T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API</i> specification recommends that port statistics be checked once a minute, and if the value or a given statistics parameter has grown by more than the number indicated for that parameter in HBA_PortStatistics, an event is generated, but the actual frequency with which growth is monitored is hardware-specific.

`pCallbackHandle`

TBD


## Return Value

The <b>HBA_RegisterForAdapterPortStatEvents</b> routine returns a value of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557233">HBA_STATUS</a> that indicates the status of the HBA. In particular, this member should have one of the following values.
<table>

<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Returned if the callback routine was successfully registered. 

</td>

<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_WWN</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Returned if the HBA referenced by <i>handle</i> does not have a port with a name that matches the value in <i>PortWWN</i>.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Returned if the hardware does not support statistic events. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Returned if an unspecified error occurred that prevented the registration of the callback routine. 

</td>
</tr>
