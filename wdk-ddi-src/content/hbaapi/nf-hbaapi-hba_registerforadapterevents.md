# HBA_RegisterForAdapterEvents function



## -description
The <b>HBA_RegisterForAdapterEvents</b> routine registers the indicated user callback routine to call when an adapter event occurs. 



## -syntax

````
HBA_STATUS HBA_API HBA_RegisterForAdapterEvents(
   HBA_ADAPTER_CALLBACK callback,
   void                 *userData,
   HBA_HANDLE           handle,
   HBA_CALLBACKHANDLE   *callbackHandle
);
````


## -parameters

### -param callback 

Pointer to a callback routine of type <a href="storage.hba_adapter_callback">HBA_ADAPTER_CALLBACK</a> that is called when an adapter is added to the system.


### -param userData 

Pointer to a buffer that is passed to the callback routine with each event. This data correlates the event with the source of the event registration. 


### -param handle 

Contains a value returned by the routine <a href="storage.hba_openadapter">HBA_OpenAdapter</a> that identifies the HBA for which the adapter events are generated. 


### -param callbackHandle 

Contains an opaque identifier that the user must pass to <a href="storage.hba_removecallback">HBA_RemoveCallback</a> to de-register the callback routine.


## -returns
The <b>HBA_RegisterForAdapterEvents</b> routine returns a value of type <a href="storage.hba_status">HBA_STATUS</a> that indicates the status of the HBA. In particular, this member should have one of the following values.
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_OK</b></dt>
</dl>Returned if the callback routine was successfully registered. 
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR</b></dt>
</dl>Returned if an unspecified error occurred that prevented the registration of the callback routine. 

 


## -remarks
If the HBA referenced by <i>handle </i>is removed from the system, the callback function is called with event type of HBA_EVENT_ADAPTER_REMOVE.

If the configuration of the HBA referenced by <i>handle </i>is changed, the callback function is called with event type of HBA_EVENT_ADAPTER_CHANGE.
