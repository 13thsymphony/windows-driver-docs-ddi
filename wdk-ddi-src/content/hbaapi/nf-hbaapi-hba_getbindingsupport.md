# HBA_GetBindingSupport function
The <b>HBA_GetBindingSupport</b> routine retrieves the binding capabilities currently enabled for the specified port.

## Syntax

````
HBA_STATUS HBA_API HBA_GetBindingSupport(
  _In_  HBA_HANDLE          Handle,
  _In_  HBA_WWN             HbaPortWWN,
  _Out_ HBA_BIND_CAPABILITY *Flags
);
````

## Parameters

`Handle`

Contains a value returned by the routine <a href="..\hbaapi\nf-hbaapi-hba_openadapter.md">HBA_OpenAdapter</a> that identifies the HBA on which the port is located.

`HbaPortWWN`

Contains a 64-bit world-wide name (WWN) that uniquely identifies the local HBA port for which this routine retrieves persistent binding capabilities that are currently enabled. For a discussion of worldwide names, see the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API</i> specification.

`Flags`

Contains a bitwise OR of flags associated with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556046">HBA_BIND_TYPE</a> WMI property qualifier that represent the persistent binding capabilities of the port that are currently enabled.


## Return Value

The <b>HBA_GetBindingSupport</b> routine returns a value of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557233">HBA_STATUS</a> that indicates the status of the HBA. In particular, <b>HBA_GetBindingCapability</b> returns one of the following qualifiers.
