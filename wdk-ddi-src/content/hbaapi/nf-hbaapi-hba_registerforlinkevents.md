# HBA_RegisterForLinkEvents function
The <b>HBA_RegisterForLinkEvents</b> routine registers with a specified adapter for asynchronous fabric link-level events.

## Syntax

````
HBA_STATUS HBA_API HBA_RegisterForLinkEvents(
   HBA_LINK_CALLBACK  callback,
   void               *userData,
   void               *pRLIRBuffer,
   HBA_UINT32         RLIRBufferSize,
   HBA_HANDLE         handle,
   HBA_CALLBACKHANDLE *callbackHandle
);
````

## Parameters

`callback`

Pointer to a callback routine of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556121">HBA_LINK_CALLBACK</a> to call when the event occurs.

`userData`

Pointer to user input data that is passed to the callback routine when it is called with each occurrence of the event. This data can synchronize the event handling with event registration.

`pRLIRBuffer`

Pointer to registered link incident report (RLIR) data that is passed to the callback routine with each occurrence of the event. This data is overwritten by the callback routine each time it is called.

`RLIRBufferSize`

Contains the size, in bytes, of the buffer at <i>pRLIRBuffer</i>.

`Handle`

TBD

`pCallbackHandle`

TBD


## Return Value

The <b>HBA_RegisterForLinkEvents</b> routine returns a value of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557233">HBA_STATUS</a> that indicates the status of the HBA. In particular, <b>HBA_RegisterForLinkEvents</b> returns one of the following values.
