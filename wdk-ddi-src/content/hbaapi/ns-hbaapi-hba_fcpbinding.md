# HBA_FCPBinding structure
The HBA_FCPBinding structure contains an array of bindings between operating system and fibre channel protocol (FCP) identifiers for a set of logical units.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct HBA_FCPBinding {
  HBA_UINT32          NumberOfEntries;
  HBA_FCPBINDINGENTRY entry[1];
} HBA_FCPBINDING, *PHBA_FCPBINDING;
````

## Members


`NumberOfEntries`

Indicates the number of bindings.

`entry`

Contains a variable length array of structures of type <a href="..\hbaapi\ns-hbaapi-hba_fcpbindingentry.md">HBA_FCPBindingEntry</a> each of which defines a binding between a pair of operating system and fibre channel protocol (FCP) identifiers for a logical unit.
