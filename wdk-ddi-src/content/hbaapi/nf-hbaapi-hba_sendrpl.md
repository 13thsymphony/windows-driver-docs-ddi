# HBA_SendRPL function
The <b>HBA_SendRPL</b> routine sends a read port list (RPL) request to the indicated port or domain controller.

## Syntax

````
HBA_STATUS HBA_API HBA_SendRPL(
  _In_    HBA_HANDLE Handle,
  _In_    HBA_WWN    HbaPortWWN,
  _In_    HBA_WWN    AgentWwn,
  _In_    HBA_UINT32 AgentDomain,
  _In_    HBA_UINT32 PortIndex,
  _Out_   void       *pRspBuffer,
  _Inout_ HBA_UINT32 *RspBufferSize
);
````

## Parameters

`Handle`

Contains a value returned by the routine <a href="..\hbaapi\nf-hbaapi-hba_openadapter.md">HBA_OpenAdapter</a> that identifies the local HBA through which the request is sent.

`HbaPortWWN`

Contains a 64-bit worldwide name (WWN) that uniquely identifies the local port through which the read port list (RPL) command is sent. For a discussion of worldwide names, see the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API</i> specification.

`Agent_wwn`

TBD

`Agent_domain`

TBD

`PortIndex`

Contains the port index of the first port in the retrieved list of ports of type FC_Port.

`pRspBuffer`

Pointer to a buffer that receives the results of the read port list (RPL) request, if the request succeeds. If the destination port or domain controller rejects the request, this buffer holds the link service reject (LS_RJT) payload data. If the amount of returned data exceeds the buffer size specified in <i>RspBufferSize</i>, the data is truncated to the buffer size<i>. </i>The payload data is in big-endian format (higher order bytes are in lower addresses).

`pRspBufferSize`

TBD


## Return Value

The <b>HBA_SendRPL</b> routine returns a value of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557233">HBA_STATUS</a> that indicates the status of the HBA. In particular, <b>HBA_SendRPL</b> returns one of the following values.

<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR_ELS_REJECT</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Returned if the destination port referenced by <i>AgentWwn, </i>or the domain controller referenced by <i>AgentDomain, </i>rejected the request node identification information data (RNID) that identifies the source HBA. 

</td>

<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Returned if an unspecified error occurred that prevented the execution of the RPL request.
