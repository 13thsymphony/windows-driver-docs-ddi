# HBA_SendRLS function
The <b>HBA_SendRLS</b> WMI routine sends a read link error status block (RLS) request through the indicated local port to the indicated remote port to retrieve a link error status block associated with the remote port.

## Syntax

````
HBA_STATUS HBA_API HBA_SendRLS(
  _In_    HBA_HANDLE HbaHandle,
  _In_    HBA_WWN    HbaPortWWN,
  _In_    HBA_WWN    DestWWN,
  _Out_   void       *pRspBuffer,
  _Inout_ HBA_UINT32 *pRspBufferSize
);
````

## Parameters

`HbaHandle`

Contains a value returned by the routine <a href="..\hbaapi\nf-hbaapi-hba_openadapter.md">HBA_OpenAdapter</a> that identifies the HBA through which the request is sent.

`HbaPortWWN`

Contains a 64-bit worldwide name (WWN) that uniquely identifies the local port through which the request is sent. For a discussion of worldwide names, see the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API</i> specification.

`DestWWN`

Contains a 64-bit WWN that uniquely identifies the destination port to which the request is sent.

`pRspBuffer`

Pointer to a buffer that receives the output data of the RLS request, if the request succeeds. If the destination port rejects the request, this buffer holds the link service reject (LS_RJT) payload data. If the amount of returned data exceeds the buffer size specified in <i>pRspBufferSize</i>, the data is truncated to the buffer size<i>. </i>The payload data is in big-endian format (higher order bytes are in lower addresses).

`pRspBufferSize`

Indicates the size, in bytes, of the buffer at <i>pRspBuffer</i>. A size of 28 bytes is sufficient for the largest response.


## Return Value

The <b>HBA_SendRLS</b> routine returns a value of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557233">HBA_STATUS</a> that indicates the status of the HBA. In particular, <b>HBA_SendRLS</b> returns one of the following values.
