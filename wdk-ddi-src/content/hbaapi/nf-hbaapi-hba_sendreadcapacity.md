# HBA_SendReadCapacity function



## -description
The <b>HBA_SendReadCapacity</b> routine sends a SCSI read capacity command to the indicated remote port. 



## -syntax

````
HBA_STATUS HBA_API HBA_SendReadCapacity(
  _In_  HBA_HANDLE handle,
  _In_  HBA_WWN    portWWN,
  _In_  HBA_UINT64 fcLUN,
  _Out_ void       *pRspBuffer,
  _In_  HBA_UINT32 RspBufferSize,
  _Out_ void       *pSenseBuffer,
  _In_  HBA_UINT32 SenseBufferSize
);
````


## -parameters

### -param handle [in]

Contains a value returned by the routine <a href="storage.hba_openadapter">HBA_OpenAdapter</a> that identifies the HBA through which the SCSI read capacity command is sent.


### -param portWWN [in]

Contains a 64-bit worldwide name (WWN) that uniquely identifies the remote target port to which the SCSI read capacity command is sent. For a discussion of worldwide names, see the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API</i> specification. 


### -param fcLUN [in]

Indicates the fibre channel logical unit number of the logical unit to which the SCSI read capacity command will be sent. 


### -param pRspBuffer [out]

Pointer to a buffer that receives the output data of the SCSI read capacity command.


### -param RspBufferSize [in]

Indicates the size, in bytes, of the buffer at <i>pRspBuffer</i>.


### -param pSenseBuffer [out]

Pointer to a buffer that receives the SCSI sense data.


### -param SenseBufferSize [in]

On input, indicates on input the size, in bytes, of the buffer at <i>pSenseBuffer</i>. On output, this member indicates the number of bytes of sense data returned. 


## -returns
The <b>HBA_ScsiReadCapacity</b> routine returns a value of type <a href="storage.hba_status">HBA_STATUS</a> that indicates the status of the HBA. In particular, <b>HBA_ScsiReadCapacity</b> returns one of the following values.
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_OK</b></dt>
</dl>Returned if the complete payload of a reply to the SCSI read capacity command was successfully retrieved. 
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_WWN</b></dt>
</dl>Returned if the HBA referenced by <i>handle</i> does not contain a port with a name that matches <i>HbaPortWWN</i>. 
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR_NOT_A_TARGET</b></dt>
</dl>Returned if the specified remote port specified by <i>portWWN </i>does not have SCSI target functionality.
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR_TARGET_BUSY</b></dt>
</dl>Returned if the SCSI read capacity command could not be delivered without causing a SCSI overlapped command condition.
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_SCSI_CHECK_CONDITION</b></dt>
</dl>Returned if a SCSI check condition occurred and SCSI send data is provided in the buffer at <i>pSenseBuffer</i>.
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR</b></dt>
</dl>Returned if an unspecified error occurred that prevented the execution of the SCSI inquiry command.
