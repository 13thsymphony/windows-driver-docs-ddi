# HBA_ipaddress structure
The HBA_ipaddress structure specifies an IP address in a way that is independent of the version of the IP protocol in use.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct HBA_ipaddress {
  int   ipversion;
  union {
    unsigned char ipv4address[4];
    unsigned char ipv6address[16];
  } ipaddress;
} HBA_IPADDRESS, *PHBA_IPADDRESS;
````

## Members


`ipversion`

Indicates the version of the IP protocol in use.

`ipaddress`

#### ipv4address

Contains a dotted decimal IP4 address if version 4 of the IP protocol is in use. 



#### ipv6address

Contains a dotted decimal IP6 address if version 6 of the IP protocol is in use.
