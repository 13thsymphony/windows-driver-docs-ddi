# HBA_OpenAdapterByWWN function



## -description
The <b>HBA_OpenAdapterByWWN</b> routine opens the HBA that is associated with either a node or a port that has the indicated name. 



## -syntax

````
HBA_STATUS HBA_API HBA_OpenAdapterByWWN(
  _Out_ HBA_HANDLE *HbaHandle,
  _In_  HBA_WWN    Wwn

<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_OK</b></dt>
</dl>Returned if <b>HBA_OpenAdapterByWWN</b> successfully returns a valid handle. 
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_WWN</b></dt>
</dl>Returned if there is no HBA that has a port name or node name that matches <i>Wwn</i>.
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR_AMBIGUOUS_WWN</b></dt>
</dl>Returned if multiple adapters have associated port or node names that match <i>Wwn</i>. This can occur if two or more adapters are associated with nodes of the same name. 
<dl>
