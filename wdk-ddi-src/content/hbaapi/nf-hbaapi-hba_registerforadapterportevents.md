# HBA_RegisterForAdapterPortEvents function



## -description
The <b>HBA_RegisterForAdapterPortEvents</b> routine registers the indicated user callback routine to call when a port event occurs. 



## -syntax

````
HBA_STATUS HBA_API HBA_RegisterForAdapterPortEvents(
   HBA_PORT_CALLBACK  callback,
   void               *userData,
   HBA_HANDLE         handle,
   HBA_WWN            PortWWN,
   HBA_CALLBACKHANDLE *callbackHandle
);
````


## -parameters

### -param callback 

Pointer to a callback routine of type <a href="storage.hba_port_callback">HBA_PORT_CALLBACK</a> that is called when an adapter is added to the system.


### -param userData 

Pointer to a buffer that is passed to the callback routine with each event. This data correlates the event with the source of the event registration. 


### -param handle 

Contains a value returned by the routine <a href="storage.hba_openadapter">HBA_OpenAdapter</a> that identifies the HBA for which the adapter events are generated. 


### -param PortWWN 

Contains a 64-bit worldwide name (WWN) that uniquely identifies the HBA port from which port events are reported. For a discussion of worldwide names, see the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API</i> specification.


### -param callbackHandle 

Contains an opaque identifier that the user must pass to <a href="storage.hba_removecallback">HBA_RemoveCallback</a> to de-register the callback routine.


## -returns
The <b>HBA_RegisterForAdapterPortEvents</b> routine returns a value of type <a href="storage.hba_status">HBA_STATUS</a> that indicates the status of the HBA. In particular, this member should have one of the following values.
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_OK</b></dt>
</dl>Returned if the callback routine was successfully registered. 
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_WWN</b></dt>
</dl>Returned if the HBA referenced by <i>handle</i> does not have a port with a name that matches the value in <i>PortWWN</i>.
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR</b></dt>
</dl>Returned if an unspecified error occurred that prevented the registration of the callback routine. 

 


## -remarks
For a list of port events, see <a href="storage.hba_port_callback">HBA_PORT_CALLBACK</a>.
