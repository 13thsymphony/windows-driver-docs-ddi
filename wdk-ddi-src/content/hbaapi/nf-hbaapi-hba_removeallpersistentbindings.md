# HBA_RemoveAllPersistentBindings function
The <b>HBA_RemoveAllPersistentBindings</b> routine removes all persistent bindings for a specified HBA port.

## Syntax

````
HBA_STATUS HBA_API HBA_RemoveAllPersistentBindings(
  _In_ HBA_HANDLE Handle,
  _In_ HBA_WWN    HbaPortWWN
);
````

## Parameters

`Handle`

Contains a value returned by the routine <a href="..\hbaapi\nf-hbaapi-hba_openadapter.md">HBA_OpenAdapter</a> that identifies the HBA on which the port is located.

`HbaPortWWN`

Contains a 64-bit worldwide name (WWN) that uniquely identifies the local HBA port for which to remove all persistent bindings. For a discussion of worldwide names, see the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API</i> specification.


## Return Value

The <b>HBA_RemoveAllPersistentBindings</b> routine returns a value of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557233">HBA_STATUS</a> that indicates the status of the HBA. In particular, <b>HBA_RemoveAllPersistentBindings</b> returns one of the following values.

<table>

<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>

<tr>
<td width="40%">

<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_WWN</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Returned if the HBA referenced by <i>handle</i> does not contain a port with a name that matches <i>HbaPortWWN</i>. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Returned if the HBA referenced by <i>handle</i> does not support persistent bindings.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Returned if an unspecified error occurred that prevented the removal of the persistent bindings.
