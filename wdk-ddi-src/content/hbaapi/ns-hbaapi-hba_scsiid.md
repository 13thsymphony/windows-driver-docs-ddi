# HBA_ScsiId structure
The HBA_ScsiId structure contains information used by the operating system to identify a SCSI logical unit.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct HBA_ScsiId {
  char       OSDeviceName[256];
  HBA_UINT32 ScsiBusNumber;
  HBA_UINT32 ScsiTargetNumber;
  HBA_UINT32 ScsiOSLun;
} *PHBA_SCSIID, HBA_SCSIID;
```

## Members


`OSDeviceName`

Contains a name assigned to the device by the operating system. For example: "\device\ScsiPort3."

`ScsiBusNumber`

Contains the number assigned by the operating system to SCSI bus that the device is on.

`ScsiTargetNumber`

Contains the target ID number assigned by the operating system to the target device.

`ScsiOSLun`

Contains the logical unit number assigned by the operating system to the logical unit.

## Remarks
For a detailed discussion of how the data assigned to members of this structure should be formatted, see the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API</i> specification.
