# HBA_GetFcpTargetMapping function



## -description
The <b>HBA_GetFcpTargetMapping</b> routine retrieves the mappings between operating system and fibre channel protocol (FCP) identifiers for a set of targets that the HBA can enumerate.



## -syntax

````
HBA_STATUS HBA_API HBA_GetFcpTargetMapping(
  _In_    HBA_HANDLE            HbaHandle,
  _Inout_ PHBA_FCPTARGETMAPPING Mapping
);
````


## -parameters

### -param HbaHandle [in]

Contains a value returned by the routine <a href="..\hbaapi\nf-hbaapi-hba_openadapter.md">HBA_OpenAdapter</a> that identifies the HBA to query for the target mappings. The HBA returns mappings for the targets that it can enumerate. 


### -param Mapping [in, out]

Pointer to a structure of type <a href="..\hbaapi\ns-hbaapi-hba_fcptargetmapping.md">HBA_FCPTargetMapping</a> that contains an array of bindings between operating system and FCP identifiers for a set of target devices. These mappings are maintained by the HBA referenced by <i>HbaHandle</i>. On input, the <b>NumberOfEntries</b> member of HBA_FCPTargetMapping should contain a number of mappings that fit in the output buffer. On output, the <b>NumberOfEntries</b> contains the number of mappings requested, or the full set of mappings, whichever is smaller. The value in <b>NumberOfEntries</b> contains the number of mappings returned even when an error occurred due to insufficient buffer space. 


## -returns
The <b>HBA_GetFcpTargetMapping</b> routine returns a value of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557233">HBA_STATUS</a> that indicates the status of the HBA. In particular, <b>HBA_GetFcpTargetMapping</b> returns one of the following qualifiers.
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_OK</b></dt>
</dl>Returned if all the mapping entries were retrieved. 
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR_MORE_DATA</b></dt>
</dl>Returned if there was insufficient buffer space to retrieve all of the target mappings. 
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR</b></dt>
</dl>Returned if an unspecified error occurred that prevented the retrieval of the target mappings.
