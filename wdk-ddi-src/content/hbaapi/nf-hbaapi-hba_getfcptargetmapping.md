# HBA_GetFcpTargetMapping function
The <b>HBA_GetFcpTargetMapping</b> routine retrieves the mappings between operating system and fibre channel protocol (FCP) identifiers for a set of targets that the HBA can enumerate.

## Syntax

````
HBA_STATUS HBA_API HBA_GetFcpTargetMapping(
  _In_    HBA_HANDLE            HbaHandle,
  _Inout_ PHBA_FCPTARGETMAPPING Mapping
);
````

## Parameters

`Handle`

TBD

`Mapping`

Pointer to a structure of type <a href="..\hbaapi\ns-hbaapi-hba_fcptargetmapping.md">HBA_FCPTargetMapping</a> that contains an array of bindings between operating system and FCP identifiers for a set of target devices. These mappings are maintained by the HBA referenced by <i>HbaHandle</i>. On input, the <b>NumberOfEntries</b> member of HBA_FCPTargetMapping should contain a number of mappings that fit in the output buffer. On output, the <b>NumberOfEntries</b> contains the number of mappings requested, or the full set of mappings, whichever is smaller. The value in <b>NumberOfEntries</b> contains the number of mappings returned even when an error occurred due to insufficient buffer space.


## Return Value

The <b>HBA_GetFcpTargetMapping</b> routine returns a value of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557233">HBA_STATUS</a> that indicates the status of the HBA. In particular, <b>HBA_GetFcpTargetMapping</b> returns one of the following qualifiers.
