# HBA_SetPersistentBindingV2 function
The <b>HBA_SetPersistentBindingV2</b> routine establishes a set of bindings between operating system and fibre channel protocol (FCP) identifiers for the logical units that the HBA can enumerate on the specified port.

## Syntax

````
HBA_STATUS HBA_API HBA_SetPersistentBindingV2(
  _In_ HBA_HANDLE       Handle,
  _In_ HBA_WWN          HbaPortWWN,
  _In_ PHBA_FCPBINDING2 Binding
);
````

## Parameters

`Handle`

Contains a value returned by the routine <a href="..\hbaapi\nf-hbaapi-hba_openadapter.md">HBA_OpenAdapter</a> that identifies the HBA on which the port referenced by <i>HbaPortWWN </i>is located.

`HbaPortWWN`

Contains a 64-bit worldwide name (WWN) that uniquely identifies the port that enumerates the logical units specified by the persistent bindings. For a discussion of worldwide names, see the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API</i> specification.

`Binding`

Contains a structure of type <a href="..\hbaapi\ns-hbaapi-hba_fcpbinding2.md">HBA_FCPBinding2</a> that holds an array of elements of type <a href="..\hbaapi\ns-hbaapi-hba_fcpbindingentry2.md">HBA_FCPBindingEntry2</a>, each of which holds a persistent binding between operating system and fibre channel protocol (FCP) identifiers for a logical unit. On input, the <b>NumberOfEntries</b> member of HBA_FCPBinding2 should contain the number of bindings that fit in the output buffer. On output, <b>NumberOfEntries</b> holds the number of bindings actually returned, which is equal to the number specified on input or the full set of available bindings, whichever is smaller. The value in <b>NumberOfEntries</b> will contain the number of persistent bindings returned even when an error occurred because of insufficient buffer space. 

On output, the <b>Status</b> member of each HBA_FCPBindingEntry2 structure is 0.


## Return Value

The <b>HBA_SetBindingSupport2</b> routine returns a value of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557233">HBA_STATUS</a> that indicates the status of the HBA. In particular, <b>HBA_SetBindingSupport2</b> returns one of the following values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Returned if one or more of the persistent bindings were successfully established. Each requested binding can succeed or fail independently of the others. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_WWN</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Returned if the HBA referenced by <i>handle</i> does not contain a port with a name that matches <i>HbaPortWWN</i>. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Returned if the adapter referenced by <i>handle </i>does not support persistent bindings. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>HBA_STATUS_ERROR</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Returned if an unspecified error occurred that prevented the routine from associating any of the specified persistent bindings with the port. 

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

The <b>HBA_SetPersistentBindingV2</b> routine establishes a set of bindings between operating system and fibre channel protocol (FCP) identifiers for the logical units that the HBA, referenced by <i>HbaHandle, </i>can enumerate on the port specified by <i>HbaPortWWN</i>. The bindings that <b>HBA_SetPersistentBindingV2</b> establishes persist across reboots of the operating system.
