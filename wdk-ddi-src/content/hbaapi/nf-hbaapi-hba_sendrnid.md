# HBA_SendRNID function
The <b>HBA_SendRNID</b> routine sends a request for node identification data (RNID) to the indicated HBA, which in turn routes the request through the indicated port or node to the appropriate fabric configuration server.

## Syntax

````
HBA_STATUS HBA_API HBA_SendRNID(
  _In_    HBA_HANDLE  HbaHandle,
  _In_    HBA_WWN     Wwn,
  _In_    HBA_WWNTYPE WwnType,
  _Out_   void        *pRspBuffer,
  _Inout_ HBA_UINT32  *RspBufferSize
);
````

## Parameters

`Handle`

TBD

`Wwn`

Contains a 64-bit worldwide name (WWN) that uniquely identifies a port or a node from which the RNID command is issued. For a discussion of worldwide names, see the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API</i> specification.

`WnnType`

TBD

`pRspBuffer`

Pointer to a buffer that contains, in big-endian (wire) format, the payload data from the reply to the node identification request.

`RspBufferSize`

On input, indicates the size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by <i>pRspBuffer</i>. On return, this member indicates the size, in bytes, of the response data.


## Return Value

The <b>HBA_SendRNID</b> routine returns a value of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557233">HBA_STATUS</a> that indicates the status of the HBA.

## Remarks

The node identification data request is a common transport (CT) command that queries a fabric configuration server for node identification data. For a complete description of this command, see the sections dealing with node identification requests in the <i>Fibre Channel Generic Services - 4 (FC-GS-4)</i> specification published by the ANSI committee.

The <b>HBA_SendRNID</b> library routine serves a purpose very similar to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565459">SendRNID</a> WMI method.
