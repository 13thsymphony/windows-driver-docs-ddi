# HBA_FCPTargetMapping structure
The HBA_FCPTargetMapping structure contains an array of bindings between operating system and fibre channel protocol (FCP) identifiers for a set of target devices.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct HBA_FCPTargetMapping {
  HBA_UINT32       NumberOfEntries;
  HBA_FCPSCSIENTRY entry[1];
} HBA_FCPTARGETMAPPING, *PHBA_FCPTARGETMAPPING;
````

## Members


`entry`

Contains a variable length array of structures of type <a href="..\hbaapi\ns-hbaapi-hba_fcpscsientry.md">HBA_FcpScsiEntry</a> each of which defines a mapping between an operating system identifier for a logical unit and the corresponding fibre channel protocol (FCP) identifier for the logical unit.

`NumberOfEntries`

Indicates the number of bindings.
