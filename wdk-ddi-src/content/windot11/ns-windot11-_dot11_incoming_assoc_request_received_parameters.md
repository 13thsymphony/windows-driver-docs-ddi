# _DOT11_INCOMING_ASSOC_REQUEST_RECEIVED_PARAMETERS structure
<div class="alert"><b>Important</b>  The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560689">Native 802.11 Wireless LAN</a> interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6EF92E34-7BC9-465E-B05D-2BCB29165A18">WLAN Universal Windows driver model</a>.</div><div> </div>The DOT11_INCOMING_ASSOC_REQUEST_RECEIVED_PARAMETERS structure specifies the results of the
  acceptance procedure of the 802.11 station after it receives an incoming association request, or
  re-association request, from a peer station on an infrastructure BSS.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DOT11_INCOMING_ASSOC_REQUEST_RECEIVED_PARAMETERS {
  NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER Header;
  DOT11_MAC_ADDRESS  PeerMacAddr;
  BOOLEAN            bReAssocReq;
  ULONG              uAssocReqOffset;
  ULONG              uAssocReqSize;
} DOT11_INCOMING_ASSOC_REQUEST_RECEIVED_PARAMETERS, *PDOT11_INCOMING_ASSOC_REQUEST_RECEIVED_PARAMETERS;
````

## Members


`bReAssocReq`

For nonzero values of 
     <b>uStatus</b>, 
     <b>bReAssocReq</b> is <b>TRUE</b> if the request from the peer station is a re-association request.

`Header`

The type, revision, and size of the DOT11_INCOMING_ASSOC_REQUEST_RECEIVED_PARAMETERS structure.
     This member is formatted as an 
     <a href="..\ntddndis\ns-ntddndis-_ndis_object_header.md">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a> structure.
     

The miniport driver must set the members of 
     <b>Header</b> to the following values:



For more information about these members, see 
     <a href="..\ntddndis\ns-ntddndis-_ndis_object_header.md">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a>.


#### Revision

This member must be set to DOT11_INCOMING_ASSOC_REQUEST_RECEIVED_PARAMETERS_REVISION_1.


#### Size

This member must be set to 
       <b>sizeof</b>(DOT11_INCOMING_ASSOC_REQUEST_RECEIVED_PARAMETERS).


#### Type

This member must be set to NDIS_OBJECT_TYPE_DEFAULT.

`PeerMacAddr`

The media access control (MAC) address of the peer station that sent an association
     request.

`uAssocReqOffset`

For nonzero values of 
     <b>uStatus</b>, this member specifies the offset of the request frame that is used in the association
     operation. The frame includes information elements (IEs) but does not include the 802.11 MAC
     header.

`uAssocReqSize`

For nonzero values of 
     <b>uStatus</b>, this member specifies the length, in bytes, of the request frame that is used in the
     association operation. The frame includes information elements (IEs) but does not include the 802.11 MAC
     header.

## Remarks
The Native 802.11 miniport driver includes a DOT11_INCOMING_ASSOC_REQUEST_RECEIVED_PARAMETERS
    structure when the driver makes an 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/network/ndis-status-dot11-incoming-assoc-request-received">
    NDIS_STATUS_DOT11_INCOMING_ASSOC_REQUEST_RECEIVED</a> status indication.

## Requirements
