## -struct-fields

### -field Header

The type, revision, and size of the DOT11_INCOMING_ASSOC_REQUEST_RECEIVED_PARAMETERS structure.
     This member is formatted as an 
     <a href="..\ntddndis\ns-ntddndis-_ndis_object_header.md">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a> structure.
     

The miniport driver must set the members of 
     <b>Header</b> to the following values:




### -field Type

This member must be set to NDIS_OBJECT_TYPE_DEFAULT.


### -field Revision

This member must be set to DOT11_INCOMING_ASSOC_REQUEST_RECEIVED_PARAMETERS_REVISION_1.


### -field Size

This member must be set to 
       <b>sizeof</b>(DOT11_INCOMING_ASSOC_REQUEST_RECEIVED_PARAMETERS).

</dd>
</dl>
For more information about these members, see 
     <a href="..\ntddndis\ns-ntddndis-_ndis_object_header.md">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a>.


### -field PeerMacAddr

The media access control (MAC) address of the peer station that sent an association
     request.


### -field bReAssocReq

For nonzero values of 
     <b>uStatus</b>, 
     <b>bReAssocReq</b> is <b>TRUE</b> if the request from the peer station is a re-association request.


### -field uAssocReqOffset

For nonzero values of 
     <b>uStatus</b>, this member specifies the offset of the request frame that is used in the association
     operation. The frame includes information elements (IEs) but does not include the 802.11 MAC
     header.


### -field uAssocReqSize

For nonzero values of 
     <b>uStatus</b>, this member specifies the length, in bytes, of the request frame that is used in the
     association operation. The frame includes information elements (IEs) but does not include the 802.11 MAC
     header.


## -remarks
The Native 802.11 miniport driver includes a DOT11_INCOMING_ASSOC_REQUEST_RECEIVED_PARAMETERS
    structure when the driver makes an 
    <a href="netvista.ndis_status_dot11_incoming_assoc_request_received">
    NDIS_STATUS_DOT11_INCOMING_ASSOC_REQUEST_RECEIVED</a> status indication.
