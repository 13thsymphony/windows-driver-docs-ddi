# _DOT11_DISASSOCIATE_PEER_REQUEST structure
<div class="alert"><b>Important</b>  The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560689">Native 802.11 Wireless LAN</a> interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6EF92E34-7BC9-465E-B05D-2BCB29165A18">WLAN Universal Windows driver model</a>.</div><div> </div>The DOT11_DISASSOCIATE_PEER_REQUEST structure specifies a disassociation operation in which the NIC
  disassociates from a peer station.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DOT11_DISASSOCIATE_PEER_REQUEST {
  NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER Header;

## Members


`Header`

The type, revision, and size of the DOT11_DISASSOCIATE_PEER_REQUEST structure. This member is
     formatted as an 
     <a href="..\ntddndis\ns-ntddndis-_ndis_object_header.md">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a> structure.
     

The miniport driver must set the members of 
     <b>Header</b> to the following values:





#### Type

This member must be set to NDIS_OBJECT_TYPE_DEFAULT.



#### Revision

This member must be set to DOT11_DISASSOCIATE_PEER_REQUEST_REVISION_1.



#### Size

This member must be set to 
       <b>sizeof</b>(DOT11_DISASSOCIATE_PEER_REQUEST).

For more information about these members, see 
     <a href="..\ntddndis\ns-ntddndis-_ndis_object_header.md">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a>.

`PeerMacAddr`

The media access control (MAC) address of the peer station that the 802.11 station is to
     disassociate from. If 
     <b>PeerMacAddr</b> has a value of 0xFF, the 802.11 station must disassociate from all
     associated stations. When 
     <b>PeerMacAddr</b> is a unicast address, the 802.11 station must disassociate from a
     specific station.

`usReason`

A USHORT value that specifies the reason code field in the disassociation frame that is sent by
     the 802.11 miniport driver.
