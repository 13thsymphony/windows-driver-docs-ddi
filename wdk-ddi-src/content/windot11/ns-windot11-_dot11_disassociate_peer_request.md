typedef struct _DOT11_DISASSOCIATE_PEER_REQUEST {
  NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER Header;

## -struct-fields

### -field Header

The type, revision, and size of the DOT11_DISASSOCIATE_PEER_REQUEST structure. This member is
     formatted as an 
     <a href="netvista.ndis_object_header">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a> structure.
     

The miniport driver must set the members of 
     <b>Header</b> to the following values:




### -field Type

This member must be set to NDIS_OBJECT_TYPE_DEFAULT.


### -field Revision

This member must be set to DOT11_DISASSOCIATE_PEER_REQUEST_REVISION_1.

</dl>
For more information about these members, see 
     <a href="netvista.ndis_object_header">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a>.


### -field PeerMacAddr

The media access control (MAC) address of the peer station that the 802.11 station is to
     disassociate from. If 
     <b>PeerMacAddr</b> has a value of 0xFF, the 802.11 station must disassociate from all
     associated stations. When 
     <b>PeerMacAddr</b> is a unicast address, the 802.11 station must disassociate from a
     specific station.


### -field usReason

A USHORT value that specifies the reason code field in the disassociation frame that is sent by
     the 802.11 miniport driver.
