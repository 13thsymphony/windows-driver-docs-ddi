## Members


`ullDecryptFailureCount`

The number of encrypted packets that the peer station failed to decrypt.

`ullDecryptSuccessCount`

The number of received encrypted packets that the peer station successfully decrypted.

`ullRxPacketFailureCount`

The number of MSDU packets and MMPDU frames that the IEEE MAC sublayer of the peer station
     attempted to receive, but that failed to be received.

`ullRxPacketSuccessCount`

The number of MSDU packets and MMPDU frames that the IEEE MAC sublayer of the peer station
     successfully received.

`ullTxPacketFailureCount`

The number of MSDU packets and MMPDU frames that the IEEE MAC sublayer of the peer station
     attempted to transmit, but that failed to transmit.

`ullTxPacketSuccessCount`

The number of MAC service data unit (MSDU) packets and MAC management protocol data unit (MMPDU)
     frames that the IEEE MAC sublayer of the peer station successfully transmitted.
