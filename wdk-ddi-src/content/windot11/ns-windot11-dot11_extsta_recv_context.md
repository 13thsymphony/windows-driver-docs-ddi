## -struct-fields

### -field Header

The type, revision, and size of the DOT11_EXTSTA_RECV_CONTEXT structure. This member is formatted
     as an 
     <a href="netvista.ndis_object_header">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a> structure.
     

The miniport driver must set the members of 
     <b>Header</b> to the following values:




### -field Type

This member must be set to NDIS_OBJECT_TYPE_DEFAULT.


### -field Revision

This member must be set to DOT11_EXTSTA_RECV_CONTEXT_REVISION_1.


### -field Size

This member must be set to 
       sizeof(DOT11_EXTSTA_RECV_CONTEXT).

</dd>
</dl>
For more information about these members, see 
     <a href="netvista.ndis_object_header">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a>.


### -field uReceiveFlags

The attributes of the received packet data specified through a bitmask. 
     

If the miniport driver is operating in ExtSTA mode, the driver must always set 
     <b>uReceiveFlags</b> to zero.

The following flag values are valid for the miniport driver if is operating in NetMon mode.




### -field DOT11_RECV_FLAG_RAW_PACKET

If this bit is set, the packet contains the data as it was originally received by the 802.11
       station. For more information about raw packets, see 
       <a href="netvista.indicating_raw_802_11_packets">Indicating Raw 802.11
       Packets</a>.


### -field DOT11_RECV_FLAG_RAW_PACKET_FCS_FAILURE

If this bit is set, the raw packet data was received with frame check sequence (FCS) failures.
       

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The miniport driver must set DOT11_RECV_FLAG_RAW_PACKET when setting
       DOT11_RECV_FLAG_RAW_PACKET_FCS_FAILURE.</div>
<div> </div>

### -field DOT11_RECV_FLAG_RAW_PACKET_TIMESTAMP

If this bit is set, the NIC sets the timestamp information in the 
       <b>ullTimestamp</b> member.

</dd>
</dl>

### -field uPhyId

The identifier (ID) of the PHY on which the 802.11 station received the packet.


### -field uChCenterFrequency

The channel center frequency, in units of megahertz (MHz), of the frequency band on which the
     802.11 station received the packet.


### -field usNumberOfMPDUsReceived

The number of media access control (MAC) protocol data unit (MPDU) fragments received and
     reassembled by the 802.11 station for the packet. The value of 
     <b>usNumberOfMPDUsReceived</b> must be from one through the value of DOT11_MAX_NUM_OF_FRAGMENTS.


### -field lRSSI

The received signal strength indication (RSSI) value for the last received MPDU fragment of the
     802.11 packet. The RSSI value is in units of decibels referenced to 1.0 milliwatts (dBm).


### -field ucDataRate

The data rate at which the 802.11 station received the packet. The value of 
     <b>ucDataRate</b> is the value of the 
     <b>ucDataRateIndex</b> member of the data rate from the 802.11 station's data rate mapping table. For
     more information about the data rate mapping table, see 
     <a href="netvista.oid_dot11_data_rate_mapping_table">
     OID_DOT11_DATA_RATE_MAPPING_TABLE</a>.


### -field uSizeMediaSpecificInfo

The size, in bytes, of the media specific information at the 
     <b>pvMediaSpecificInfo</b> member. 
     <b>uSizeMediaSpecificInfo</b> supports copying of the media-specific information and passing it to an IHV
     extension.
     

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This member is currently reserved for future use and must contain
     zero.</div>
<div> </div>

### -field pvMediaSpecificInfo

A pointer to a buffer that contains media-specific infomration. The mininiport driver can set this
     member if the miniport driver passes media-specific OOB data to an IHV-specific 802.3 protocol driver.
     

The native 802.11 framework copies this pointer to the 
     <b>MediaSpecificInformation</b> entry at the 
     <b>NetBufferListInfo</b> member of the 802.3 
     <a href="netvista.net_buffer_list">NET_BUFFER_LIST</a> structures in NDIS receive
     indications.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  IHV extensions are currently unable to receive the 
     <b>MediaSpecificInformation</b>.</div>
<div> </div>

### -field ullTimestamp

An 802.11 timing synchronization function (TSF) timer value, in microseconds, that specifies the
     time when the packet was received. This member is provided to support 
     <a href="netvista.indicating_raw_802_11_packets">indicating raw 802.11 packets</a>.
     

If a NIC does not support 
     <b>ullTimestamp</b>, it must not set the DOT11_RECV_FLAG_RAW_PACKET_TIMESTAMP flag in the 
     <b>uReceiveFlags</b> member.


## -remarks
When performing a Native 802.11 receive operation, the miniport driver must format each received
    802.11 packet as a 
    <a href="netvista.net_buffer_list">NET_BUFFER_LIST</a> structure, with the packet
    data formatted as a 
    <a href="netvista.net_buffer">NET_BUFFER</a> structure and linked to the
    NET_BUFFER_LIST structure. Each NET_BUFFER_LIST structure must include out-of-band (OOB) data. The OOB
    data specifies the attributes of the received packet that are specific to the wireless LAN (WLAN)
    media.

The miniport driver accesses the Native 802.11 OOB data through the 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568401">NET_BUFFER_LIST_INFO</a> macro with the
    following parameters:

The 
      <i>_NBL</i> parameter, which is passed the pointer to the 
      <a href="netvista.net_buffer_list">NET_BUFFER_LIST</a> structure used for the
      received 802.11 packet.

The _
      <i>id</i> parameter, which is passed the identifier (ID) value of 
      <b>MediaSpecificInformation</b>.

If the miniport driver sets DOT11_RECV_FLAG_RAW_PACKET in the 
    <b>uReceiveFlags</b> member, the driver must follow these guidelines when preparing the
    DOT11_EXTSTA_RECV_CONTEXT structure:

Set the value of 
      <b>usNumberOfMPDUsReceived</b> to one.

Set the value of 
      <b>lRSSI</b> to the RSSI value for the raw packet itself.

Set the value of 
      <b>ucDataRate</b> to the 
      <b>ucDataRateIndex</b> value for the raw packet itself.

Set the value of 
      <b>ucRSSI</b> to the normalized RSSI value for the raw packet itself.

For more information about raw packets, see 
    <a href="netvista.indicating_raw_802_11_packets">Indicating Raw 802.11
    Packets</a>.
