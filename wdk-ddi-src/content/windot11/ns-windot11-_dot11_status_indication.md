# _DOT11_STATUS_INDICATION structure



## -description

## -syntax

````
typedef struct _DOT11_STATUS_INDICATION {
  ULONG       uStatusType;
  NDIS_STATUS ndisStatus;
} DOT11_STATUS_INDICATION, *PDOT11_STATUS_INDICATION;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field uStatusType

The type of status indication that is made by the miniport driver.
     

For more information about the value that is used for the 
     <b>uStatusType</b> member, see the topic for the OID that requires a completion indication that uses the
     DOT11_STATUS_INDICATION structure.


### -field ndisStatus

An NDIS_STATUS value that indicates the result of the operation.
     

If the operation completed without a failure, the miniport driver must set the 
     <b>ndisStatus</b> member to NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS. Otherwise, the driver must set 
     <b>ndisStatus</b> to the appropriate NDIS_STATUS_xxx value for the failure.


## -remarks
For the Windows Vista operating system, only 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569409">OID_DOT11_RESET_REQUEST</a> requires the
    use of the DOT11_STATUS_INDICATION structure for completion indications.
