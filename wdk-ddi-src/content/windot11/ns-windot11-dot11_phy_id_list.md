# DOT11_PHY_ID_LIST structure



## -description

## -syntax

````
typedef struct DOT11_PHY_ID_LIST {
  NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER Header;
  ULONG              uNumOfEntries;

  ULONG              dot11PhyId[1];

## -struct-fields

### -field Header

The type, revision, and size of the DOT11_PHY_ID_LIST structure. This member is formatted as an 
     <a href="netvista.ndis_object_header">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a> structure.
     

The miniport driver must set the members of 
     <b>Header</b> to the following values:




### -field Type

This member must be set to NDIS_OBJECT_TYPE_DEFAULT.


### -field Revision

This member must be set to DOT11_PHY_ID_LIST_REVISION_1.


### -field Size

This member must be set to 
       sizeof(DOT11_PHY_ID_LIST).

</dd>
</dl>
For more information about these members, see 
     <a href="netvista.ndis_object_header">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a>.


### -field uNumOfEntries

The number of entries in the 
     <b>dot11PhyId</b> array.


### -field uTotalNumOfEntries

The maximum number of entries that the 
     <b>dot11PhyId</b> array can contain.


### -field dot11PhyId

The list of PHY identifiers (IDs).


## -remarks
A PHY ID in the 
    <b>dot11PhyId</b> array must be one of the following:

An index into the table of supported PHYs that are defined by the Native 802.11 Operational 
      <b>msDot11SupportedPhyTypes</b> management information base (MIB) object. For more information about PHY
      IDs and the 
      <b>msDot11SupportedPhyTypes</b> MIB object, see 
      <a href="netvista.oid_dot11_supported_phy_types">
      OID_DOT11_SUPPORTED_PHY_TYPES</a>.

A PHY ID with the value of DOT11_PHY_ID_ANY. This PHY ID is called a 
      <i>wildcard PHY ID</i> and is used to specify any supported PHY on the 802.11 station. If the wildcard
      PHY ID is used, it must be the only entry in the 
      <b>dot11PhyId</b> array.

A miniport driver returns the DOT11_PHY_ID_LIST structure when queried by either 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569102">OID_DOT11_ACTIVE_PHY_LIST</a> or 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569144">OID_DOT11_DESIRED_PHY_LIST</a>.

When these OIDs are queried, the miniport driver must verify that the 
    <b>InformationBuffer</b> member of the 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-miniport_oid_request.md">MiniportOidRequest</a> function's
    <i>OidRequest</i> parameter is large enough to return the entire DOT11_PHY_ID_LIST structure, including
    all entries in the 
    <b>dot11PhyId</b> array. The value of the 
    <b>InformationBufferLength</b> member of the 
    <i>OidRequest</i> parameter determines what the miniport driver must do, as the following list shows:

If the value of the 
      <b>InformationBufferLength</b> member is less than the length, in bytes, of the entire DOT11_PHY_ID_LIST
      structure, the miniport driver must do the following:

Set the 
        <b>uNumOfEntries</b> member to zero.

Set the 
        <b>uTotalNumOfEntries</b> member to the number of entries in the 
        <b>dot11PhyId</b> array.

For the 
        <i>OidRequest</i> parameter, set the 
        <b>BytesWritten</b> member to zero and the 
        <b>BytesNeeded</b> member to the length, in bytes, of the entire DOT11_PHY_ID_LIST structure.

Fail the query request by returning NDIS_STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW from its 
        <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-miniport_oid_request.md">MiniportOidRequest</a> function.

If the value of the 
      <b>InformationBufferLength</b> member is greater than or equal to the length, in bytes, of the entire
      DOT11_PHY_ID_LIST structure, the miniport driver must do the following to complete a successful query
      request:

For the DOT11_PHY_ID_LIST structure, set the 
        <b>uNumOfEntries</b> and 
        <b>uTotalNumOfEntries</b> members to the total number of entries in the 
        <b>dot11PhyId</b> array.

For the 
        <i>OidRequest</i> parameter, set the 
        <b>BytesNeeded</b> member to zero and the 
        <b>BytesWritten</b> member to the length, in bytes, of the entire DOT11_PHY_ID_LIST structure. The
        miniport driver must also copy the entire DOT11_PHY_ID_LIST structure to the 
        <b>InformationBuffer</b> member.

Return NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS from its 
        <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-miniport_oid_request.md">MiniportOidRequest</a> function.
