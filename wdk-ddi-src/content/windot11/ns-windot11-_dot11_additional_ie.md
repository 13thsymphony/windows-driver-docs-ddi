# _DOT11_ADDITIONAL_IE structure
<div class="alert"><b>Important</b>  The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560689">Native 802.11 Wireless LAN</a> interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6EF92E34-7BC9-465E-B05D-2BCB29165A18">WLAN Universal Windows driver model</a>.</div><div> </div>The DOT11_ADDITIONAL_IE structure specifies characteristics of additional information elements (IEs)
  for a BSS 802.11 Beacon or Probe Response frame.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DOT11_ADDITIONAL_IE {
  NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER Header;
  ULONG              uBeaconIEsOffset;
  ULONG              uBeaconIEsLength;

## Members


`Header`

The type, revision, and size of the DOT11_ADDITIONAL_IE structure. This member is formatted as an 
     <a href="..\ntddndis\ns-ntddndis-_ndis_object_header.md">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a> structure.
     

The miniport driver must set the members of 
     <b>Header</b> to the following values:



For more information about these members, see 
     <a href="..\ntddndis\ns-ntddndis-_ndis_object_header.md">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a>.


#### Revision

This member must be set to DOT11_ADDITIONAL_IE_REVISION_1.


#### Size

This member must be set to 
       <b>sizeof</b>(DOT11_ADDITIONAL_IE).


#### Type

This member must be set to NDIS_OBJECT_TYPE_DEFAULT.

`uBeaconIEsLength`

The length of the additional IEs, in bytes, in the beacon frame sent by the NIC. The default value
     is 0.

`uBeaconIEsOffset`

The offset of the additional IEs, in bytes, in the beacon frame sent by the NIC. This offset is
     relative to the start of the buffer that contains the DOT11_ADDITIONAL_IE structure. The default value
     is 0.

`uResponseIEsLength`

The length of the additional IEs, in bytes, in the probe response frame sent by the NIC. The
     default value is 0.

`uResponseIEsOffset`

The offset of the additional IEs, in bytes, in the probe response frame sent by the NIC. This
     offset is relative to the start of the buffer that contains the DOT11_ADDITIONAL_IE structure. The
     default value is 0.

## Remarks
This structure is used with 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569103">OID_DOT11_ADDITIONAL_IE</a>.

The miniport driver should reset the members of the DOT11_ADDITIONAL_IE structure to the default
    values when it receives an 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569409">OID_DOT11_RESET_REQUEST</a> request.

## Requirements
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows version** | Available in Windows 7 and later versions of the Windows operating   systems. Available in Windows 7 and later versions of the Windows operating   systems. |
