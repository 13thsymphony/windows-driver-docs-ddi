# ACPI


Overview of the ACPI technology.

To develop ACPI, you need these headers:

 * [acpiioct.h](..\acpiioct\index.md)
 * [acpitabl.h](..\acpitabl\index.md)
 * [oprghdlr.h](..\oprghdlr\index.md)

For the programming guide, see [ACPI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/acpi).

This section contains reference documentation for developing drivers to interface with Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) devices. ACPI devices are defined by the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) Specification.
