# Point of Service (POS)


Overview of the Point of Service (POS) technology.

To develop Point of Service (POS), you need these headers:

 * [pointofservicecommontypes.h](..\pointofservicecommontypes\index.md)
 * [pointofservicedriverinterface.h](..\pointofservicedriverinterface\index.md)
 * [poscx.h](..\poscx\index.md)

For the programming guide, see [Point of Service (POS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/pos).

The Microsoft POS API  provides applications with a simple and consistent interface for communicating with Point of Service (POS) peripheral devices, such as bar code scanners and magnetic card readers. 

This section contains reference topics for POS drivers and the PosCx API.
