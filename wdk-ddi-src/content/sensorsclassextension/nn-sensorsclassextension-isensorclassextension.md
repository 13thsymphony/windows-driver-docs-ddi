# ISensorClassExtension interface

The ISensorClassExtension interface provides methods that the sensor driver uses to communicate with the sensor platform (and, therefore, client applications) through the sensor class extension object.

## Methods

<p>The <b>ISensorClassExtension</b> interface has these methods.</p>

| Method | Description |
| ---- |:---- |
| [ISensorClassExtension::CleanupFile](nf-sensorsclassextension-isensorclassextension-cleanupfile.md) | The ISensorClassExtension::CleanupFile method notifies the class extension about a file handle that closes and cancels all pending I/O requests, for the specified application. |
| [ISensorClassExtension::Initialize](nf-sensorsclassextension-isensorclassextension-initialize.md) | The ISensorClassExtension::Initialize method initializes the sensor class extension object. |
| [ISensorClassExtension::PostEvent](nf-sensorsclassextension-isensorclassextension-postevent.md) | The ISensorClassExtension::PostEvent method raises one or more driver events in the sensor class extension. |
| [ISensorClassExtension::PostStateChange](nf-sensorsclassextension-isensorclassextension-poststatechange.md) | The ISensorClassExtension::PostStateChange method notifies the sensor class extension about a change in the operational state of the sensor. |
| [ISensorClassExtension::ProcessIoControl](nf-sensorsclassextension-isensorclassextension-processiocontrol.md) | The ISensorClassExtension::ProcessControl method sends Windows Portable Devices (WPD) I/O control requests to the sensor class extension for processing. |
| [ISensorClassExtension::Uninitialize](nf-sensorsclassextension-isensorclassextension-uninitialize.md) | The ISensorClassExtension::Uninitialize method uninitializes the sensor class extension object. |
