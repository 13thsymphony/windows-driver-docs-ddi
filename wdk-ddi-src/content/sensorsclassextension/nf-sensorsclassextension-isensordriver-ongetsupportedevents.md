# OnGetSupportedEvents method
The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545623">ISensorDriver::OnGetSupportedEvents</a> method retrieves the list of events that the specified sensor can raise.

## Syntax

````
HRESULT OnGetSupportedEvents(
   LPWSTR  pwszSensorID,
   GUID ** ppSupportedEvents,
   ULONG * pulEventCount
);
````

## Parameters

`pwszSensorID`

LPWSTR that contains the ID for the sensor from which the client application is requesting the events list.

`ppSupportedEvents`

Address of a GUID pointer that receives the array of supported event IDs. If the driver does not support events, return a buffer containing a single GUID that has its value set to GUID_NULL.

`pulEventCount`

Address of a ULONG that receives the count of event IDs in the buffer returned through ppSupportedEvents. If the driver does not support events, set this value to zero.


## Return Value

If the operation succeeds, this method returns S_OK. Otherwise, this method returns one of the error codes that are defined in Winerror.h.

## Remarks

Event IDs are represented by <b>GUID</b>s. Platform-defined events are defined in sensors.h. 

You must use CoTaskMemAlloc to create the event ID buffer. The sensor class extension frees this memory.
