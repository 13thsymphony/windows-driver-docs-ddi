# SPB_TRANSFER_LIST_ENTRY structure
The <b>SPB_TRANSFER_LIST_ENTRY</b> structure describes a single transfer in an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7415DB28-5E93-4F47-B169-7C652969D4C7">I/O transfer sequence</a>.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct SPB_TRANSFER_LIST_ENTRY {
  SPB_TRANSFER_DIRECTION Direction;
  ULONG                  DelayInUs;
  SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER    Buffer;
} SPB_TRANSFER_LIST_ENTRY, *PSPB_TRANSFER_LIST_ENTRY;
````

## Members


`Buffer`

The buffer for this transfer. This member uses one of the following buffer formats: simple buffer, scatter-gather list, or (for kernel-mode clients) MDL. For more information about buffer formats, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh406215">SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER</a>.

`DelayInUs`

An optional delay, in microseconds, before this transfer begins. For more information, see the description of the <b>DelayInUs</b> member in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh406218">SPB_TRANSFER_DESCRIPTOR</a>.

`Direction`

The direction of the transfer.  This member is set to one of the following <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh406220">SPB_TRANSFER_DIRECTION</a> enumeration values:
<ul>
<li><b>SpbTransferDirectionFromDevice</b></li>
<li><b>SpbTransferDirectionToDevice</b></li>
</ul>

## Remarks
To request an I/O transfer sequence for a target device on the bus, a client (peripheral driver) of the SPB controller driver sends an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh450857">IOCTL_SPB_EXECUTE_SEQUENCE</a> request that describes the sequence. The transfers in the sequence are described by an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh406221">SPB_TRANSFER_LIST</a> structure that is followed by an array of one or more <b>SPB_TRANSFER_LIST_ENTRY</b> structures. Each element in this array describes an individual transfer in the sequence.
