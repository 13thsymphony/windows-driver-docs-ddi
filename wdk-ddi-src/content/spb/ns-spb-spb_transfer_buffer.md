# SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER structure



## -description
The <b>SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER</b> structure describes the data buffer for an individual transfer in an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7415DB28-5E93-4F47-B169-7C652969D4C7">I/O transfer sequence</a>.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER {
  SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER_FORMAT Format;
  union {
    SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER_LIST_ENTRY Simple;
    struct {
      PSPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER_LIST_ENTRY List;
      ULONG                           ListCe;
    } BufferList;
    PMDL                           Mdl;
  };
} SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER, *PSPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Format

The buffer format.  This member is set to one of the following <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh406216">SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER_FORMAT</a> enumeration values:

<ul>
<li><b>SpbTransferBufferFormatSimple</b></li>
<li><b>SpbTransferBufferFormatList</b></li>
<li><b>SpbTransferBufferFormatSimpleNonPaged</b></li>
<li><b>SpbTransferBufferFormatMdl</b></li>
</ul>
<b>SpbTransferBufferFormatMdl</b> is a valid value only for I/O transfer sequences that are requested by clients of the SPB controller driver that are kernel-mode components.


### -field Simple

A SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER_LIST_ENTRY  structure that specifies the base address and the length of a simple transfer buffer. Use this member of the union if <b>Format</b> is <b>SpbTransferBufferFormatSimple</b> or <b>SpbTransferBufferFormatSimpleNonPaged</b>. The <b>SpbTransferBufferFormatSimpleNonPaged</b> format is used only by kernel-mode clients.


### -field BufferList

A scatter-gather list that consists of an array of buffer descriptors. Use this member of the union if <b>Format</b> is <b>SpbTransferBufferFormatList</b>.


### -field List

A pointer to an array of <b>SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER_LIST_ENTRY</b> structures that describe the buffers in the scatter-gather list.


### -field ListCe

The number of elements in the <b>List</b> array.

</dd>
</dl>

### -field Mdl

A pointer to an MDL that describes the buffer. This member is used only by kernel-mode clients. Use this member of the union if <b>Format</b> is <b>SpbTransferBufferFormatMdl</b>. For more information, see Remarks.


## -remarks
This structure is used by an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh406223">SPB_TRANSFER_LIST_ENTRY</a> structure to describe a transfer buffer.

The <b>Mdl</b> member of this structure can be used only by clients of the SPB controller driver that are kernel-mode components. User-mode clients must not use this member. For more information about MDLs, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565421">Using MDLs</a>.
