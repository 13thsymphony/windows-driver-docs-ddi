# SPB_TRANSFER_LIST structure
The <b>SPB_TRANSFER_LIST</b> structure describes an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7415DB28-5E93-4F47-B169-7C652969D4C7">I/O transfer sequence</a>.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _SPB_TRANSFER_LIST {
  ULONG                   Size;
  ULONG                   Reserved;
  ULONG                   TransferCount;
  SPB_TRANSFER_LIST_ENTRY Transfers[1];
} SPB_TRANSFER_LIST, *PSPB_TRANSFER_LIST;
````

## Members


`Reserved`

Reserved for use by the operating system. Set to zero.

`Size`

The size, in bytes, of the <b>SPB_TRANSFER_LIST</b> structure. This size value does not include any <b>Transfers</b> array elements that might follow this structure. If new members are added to future versions of this structure, the <b>Size</b> value can be used to determine which version of the <b>SPB_TRANSFER_LIST</b> structure is being used.

`TransferCount`

The number of elements in the <b>Transfers</b> array. This array contains a minimum of one element.

`Transfers`

This member is the first element in an array of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh406223">SPB_TRANSFER_LIST_ENTRY</a> structures.  Each array element describes an individual transfer in the I/O transfer sequence. If the array contains more than one element, the additional array elements immediately follow the <b>SPB_TRANSFER_LIST</b> structure in memory. The transfers are performed in the order in which they appear in the array, starting with the first element.

## Remarks
The input buffer for an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh450857">IOCTL_SPB_EXECUTE_SEQUENCE</a> request begins with an <b>SPB_TRANSFER_LIST</b> structure. The first transfer in the requested I/O transfer sequence is specified in the <b>Transfers</b> member of this structure. If the sequence contains more than one transfer, the array elements that describe the additional transfers immediately follow the <b>SPB_TRANSFER_LIST</b> structure.

The input buffer for an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh974774">IOCTL_SPB_FULL_DUPLEX</a> request begins with an <b>SPB_TRANSFER_LIST</b> structure. The <b>SPB_TRANSFER_LIST</b> structure for this request always specifies two buffers. The first buffer, which is described by the <b>Transfers</b> member of this structure, contains the data to write to the device. The second buffer, which is described by an array element that immediately follows the <b>SPB_TRANSFER_LIST</b> structure, is used to hold the data read from the device.

If your SPB controller driver supports custom I/O control (IOCTL) requests that use input or output buffers, use the <b>SPB_TRANSFER_LIST</b> structure to describe these buffers. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/577122CC-D1F8-41C5-BE77-A22FC8516B82">Using the SPB_TRANSFER_LIST Structure for Custom IOCTLs</a>.
