# SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER_LIST_ENTRY structure
The <b>SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER_LIST_ENTRY</b> structure describes either a simple transfer buffer, or an element in an array of one or more transfer buffers.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER_LIST_ENTRY {
  PVOID Buffer;
  ULONG BufferCb;
} SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER_LIST_ENTRY, *PSPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER_LIST_ENTRY;
````

## Members


`Buffer`

The virtual address of the transfer buffer. For a transfer that is requested by a client of the SPB controller driver that runs in user mode, this buffer must reside entirely in user-mode memory.

`BufferCb`

The size, in bytes, of the transfer buffer that <b>Buffer</b> points to.

## Remarks
To request an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7415DB28-5E93-4F47-B169-7C652969D4C7">I/O transfer sequence</a> for a target device on the bus, a client (peripheral driver) of the SPB controller driver sends an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh450857">IOCTL_SPB_EXECUTE_SEQUENCE</a> request that describes the sequence. The transfers in the sequence are described by an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh406221">SPB_TRANSFER_LIST</a> structure that is followed by an array of one or more <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh406223">SPB_TRANSFER_LIST_ENTRY</a> structures. Each element in this array describes an individual transfer in the sequence, and each element contains an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh406215">SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER</a> structure that describes the buffer to use for the transfer.

If the buffer format is  <b>SpbTransferBufferFormatSimple</b>, an  <b>SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER</b> structure contains a single <b>SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER_LIST_ENTRY</b> structure that describes a simple buffer that is specified by an address and a length. If the buffer format is <b>SpbTransferBufferFormatList</b>, the buffer is a scatter-gather list, and the  <b>SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER</b> structure contains a pointer to an <b>SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER_LIST_ENTRY</b> array that describes the list.
