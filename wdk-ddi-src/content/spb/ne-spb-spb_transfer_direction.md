# SPB_TRANSFER_DIRECTION enumeration



## -description
The <b>SPB_TRANSFER_DIRECTION</b> enumeration describes the direction (read or write) of a single transfer in an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7415DB28-5E93-4F47-B169-7C652969D4C7">I/O transfer sequence</a>.



## -syntax

````
typedef enum  { 
  SpbTransferDirectionNone,
  SpbTransferDirectionFromDevice,
  SpbTransferDirectionToDevice,
  SpbTransferDirectionMax
} SPB_TRANSFER_DIRECTION;
````


## -enum-fields

### -field SpbTransferDirectionNone

The data transfer direction is undefined.


### -field SpbTransferDirectionFromDevice

The data transfer direction is from the device to system memory (read from device).


### -field SpbTransferDirectionToDevice

The data transfer direction is from system memory to the device (write to device).


### -field SpbTransferDirectionMax

Reserved for use by the operating system.


## -remarks
The values in this enumeration indicate the directions of the individual transfers in an I/O transfer sequence. The input buffer for an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh450857">IOCTL_SPB_EXECUTE_SEQUENCE</a> I/O control request is an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh406221">SPB_TRANSFER_LIST</a> structure that specifies a list of transfers for the sequence. Each transfer is described by an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh406223">SPB_TRANSFER_LIST_ENTRY</a> structure that contains the transfer parameters, which include the transfer direction. The transfer direction is <b>SpbTransferDirectionFromDevice</b> for a read operation, and is <b>SpbTransferDirectionToDevice</b> for a write operation.

Your SPB controller driver can call  the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh450922">SpbRequestGetParameters</a> method to retrieve a set of SPB-specific parameters from an I/O request. One of these parameters is an <b>SPB_TRANSFER_DIRECTION</b> enumeration value that indicates the transfer direction of the previous I/O request. The SPB controller driver can use this direction value to determine whether the current read or write (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549327">IRP_MJ_READ</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550819">IRP_MJ_WRITE</a>) request requires a change in transfer direction on the bus.

In addition, <b>SpbRequestGetParameters</b> retrieves a position value that indicates the relative position of a read or write  request in the list of transfers for the multiple-request sequence. If a read request or a write request has a position value of <b>SpbRequestSequencePositionSingle</b> or <b>SpbRequestSequencePositionFirst</b>, the direction value for the previous transfer is <b>SpbTransferDirectionNone</b> (that is, there is no previous transfer direction). For a read or write request that has a position value of <b>SpbRequestSequencePositionMiddle</b> or <b>SpbRequestSequencePositionLast</b>, the direction value indicates whether the previous transfer was a read or a write. For an unlock (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh450859">IOCTL_SPB_UNLOCK_CONTROLLER</a>) request, which has a position value of <b>SpbRequestSequencePositionLast</b>, the direction value indicates whether the last transfer in the sequence was a read or a write.

A lock (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh450858">IOCTL_SPB_LOCK_CONTROLLER</a>) request has no previous direction. Similarly, an I/O control request that is passed to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5A4BC061-4703-4C46-BD5D-A891F3DA8842">EvtSpbControllerIoOther</a> callback function has no previous direction. For either of these requests, the previous direction value retrieved by <b>SpbRequestGetParameters</b> is <b>SpbTransferDirectionNone</b>.
