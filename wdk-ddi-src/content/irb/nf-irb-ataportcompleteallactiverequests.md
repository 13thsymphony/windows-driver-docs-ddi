# AtaPortCompleteAllActiveRequests function
The <b>AtaPortCompleteAllActiveRequests</b> routine completes all active IRBs for the indicated device.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The ATA port driver and ATA miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## Syntax

````
VOID AtaPortCompleteAllActiveRequests(
  _In_ PVOID ChannelExtension,
  _In_ UCHAR Target,
  _In_ UCHAR Lun,
  _In_ UCHAR IrbStatus
);
````

## Parameters

`ChannelExtension`

A pointer to the channel extension.

`Target`

Specifies the target identifier of the device.

`Lun`

Specifies the logical unit number of the device.

`IrbStatus`

Specifies the status with which the requests will be completed.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

The <b>AtaPortCompleteAllActiveRequests</b> routine completes all active IRBs on the device as indicated by the <i>Target </i>and <i>Lun</i> parameters. Miniport drivers use this routine to complete all active IRPs if there is a reset. Miniport drivers can complete IRBs on all devices concurrently by assigning a value of IDE_UNTAGGED to the <i>Target </i>and <i>Lun </i>parameters, instead of specifying a specific device.

The miniport driver must not call this routine from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558992">IdeHwInterrupt</a> routine.

## Requirements
