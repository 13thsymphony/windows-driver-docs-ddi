# AtaPortStallExecution function
The <b>AtaPortStallExecution</b> stalls in the miniport driver.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The ATA port driver and ATA miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## Syntax

````
VOID AtaPortStallExecution(
  _In_ ULONG Delay
);
````

## Parameters

`Delay`

Specifies the delay interval, in microseconds.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

Miniport drivers should rarely call the <b>AtaPortStallExecution</b> routine. The total stall time in any miniport driver routine must always be less than one millisecond. Because this call ties up a processor, the processor does no useful work while it stalls in the driver.

Typically, a miniport driver should call <b>AtaPortStallExecution</b> only if the driver must wait for some sort of state change on the HBA that is unable to cause an interrupt, or if the driver must delay for a very short interval between accesses to the HBA.

Miniport drivers should use the <a href="..\irb\nf-irb-ataportrequesttimer.md">AtaPortRequestTimer</a> routine for delays longer than 1 millisecond.
