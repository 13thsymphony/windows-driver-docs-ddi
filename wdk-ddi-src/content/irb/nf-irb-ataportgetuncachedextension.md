# AtaPortGetUnCachedExtension function
The <b>AtaPortGetUncachedExtension</b> routine allocates an uncached common buffer that is shared by the CPU and the device.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The ATA port driver and ATA miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## Syntax

````
PVOID AtaPortGetUnCachedExtension(
  _In_ PVOID ChannelExtension,
  _In_ ULONG UncachedExtensionSize,
  _In_ ULONG IrbExtensionSize
);
````

## Parameters

`ChannelExtension`

A pointer to the channel extension.

`UncachedExtensionSize`

Specifies the length, in bytes, of the uncached common buffer. Set this parameter to 0 if the miniport driver does not require an uncached extension.

`IrbExtensionSize`

Specifies the size, in bytes, that is required by the miniport driver for its per request storage, if any. 

Set this parameter set to 0 if the miniport driver does not maintain per IRB information for which it requires storage.


## Return Value

<b>AtaPortGetUncachedExtension</b> returns a virtual address pointer to the uncached extension. If it cannot allocate the requested memory, or if the memory was previously allocated, it returns <b>NULL</b>.

## Remarks

The miniport driver can use IRB extensions as storage for driver-determined, request-specific information, such as data that is necessary to process a particular request.

The port driver does not initialize IRB extensions, but sets a pointer to an extension in each IRB that it sends to the miniport driver.

HBA hardware can safely access an IRB extension.

The miniport driver must not call <b>AtaPortGetUncachedExtension</b> from any routine other than its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557465">IdeHwControl</a> routine, and only when it is processing a control action of <b>StartChannel</b>. Calls of <b>AtaPortGetUncachedExtension</b> from other miniport driver routines result in incorrect operation or even system failure. The port driver automatically frees the uncached extension after it invokes <b>IdeHwControl</b> with the <b>StopChannel</b> control action.
