# AtaPortControllerSyncRoutine function



## -description
The <b>AtaPortControllerSyncRoutine</b> routine provides synchronized access to data structures that are shared across all channels on a controller.



## -syntax

````
BOOLEAN __inline AtaPortControllerSyncRoutine(
  _In_ PVOID      ChannelExtension,
  _In_ IDE_HW_DPC ControllerSyncRoutine
);
````


## -parameters

### -param ChannelExtension [in]

A pointer to the channel extension. 


### -param ControllerSyncRoutine [in]

A pointer to the routine to call. 


## -returns
None 


## -remarks
The miniport driver uses this routine to synchronize access to data structures that are shared across channels on a controller. The miniport driver, however, should use this routine very sparingly.

The <i>ControllerSyncRoutine</i> function pointer is declared in <i>Irb.h</i> as follows:
