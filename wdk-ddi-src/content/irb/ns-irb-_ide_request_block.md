## Members


`AtaError`

Indicates the error value returned by the device in its error register. The miniport driver should update this field when completing an IRB with <i>IRB_STATUS_DEVICE_ERROR</i>.

`AtaStatus`

Indicates the status returned by the device in its status register. The miniport driver should update this field when completing an IRB with <i>IRB_STATUS_DEVICE_ERROR</i>.

`CdbLength`

Specifies the length in bytes of the buffer pointed to by <b>Cdb</b>.

`Channel`

Specifies the channel number.

`DataBuffer`

Pointer to the buffer where the data resides.

`DataTransferLength`

Contains the length in bytes of the data buffer that contains data to be transferred.

IRB_FUNCTION_ATA_READ

IRB_FUNCTION_ATA_WRITE

IRB_FUNCTION_ATA_FLUSH

IRB_FUNCTION_ATA_SMART

IRB_FUNCTION_SHUTDOWN

IRB_FUNCTION_POWER_CHANGE

IRB_FUNCTION_POWER_REBOOT

IRB_FUNCTION_LUN_RESET

IRB_FUNCTION_MINIPORT_IOCTL

Indicates that the IRB is for the miniport. It is the responsibility of the miniport to interpret the command appropriately.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`IrbExtension`

Pointer to the per-request extension allocated by the port driver.

`IrbFlags`

Qualifies the request with ceratin actions that need to be performed. The table below describes them in detail.
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<b>Flag</b>

</td>
<td>
<b>Description</b>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRB_FLAGS_DRDY_REQUIRED

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the miniport driver must wait for the device to set the DRDY bit in the ATA status register before issuing this command.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRB_FLAGS_USE_DMA

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the request has an associated scatter/gather list and the miniport driver could use DMA to transfer data for this request. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRB_FLAGS_MAP_BUFFERS

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the <b>DataBuffer</b> field in the IRB is mapped. The miniport can safely access <b>DataBuffer</b> when this flag is set. The miniport driver must not access <b>DataBuffer</b> if the flag is not set. The miniport driver could request the port driver to map the data buffer by setting this flag in the IRB in its <b>IdeHwBuildIo</b> routine.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRB_FLAGS_48BIT

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the ATA command in the IRB belongs to the 48 bit LBA feature set. The <b>Previous</b> field in the <i>_IDE_TASK_FILE</i> structure is valid when this flag is set.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRB_FLAGS_PIO_MULTIPLE

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the ATA command is to be transferred using the ATA PIO Multiple method.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRB_FLAGS_RETURN_RESULTS

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the ATA return task file is to be copied to <b>SenseInfoBuffer</b>. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRB_FLAGS_DATA_IN

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the data is to be transferred from the device to the host system (a read operation).

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRB_FLAGS_DATA_OUT

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the data is to be transferred to the device from the host system ( a write operation).

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRB_FLAGS_DISCARDABLE  

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the command shall be done in a best effort manner. (note: this is not currently employed by ATAport).

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRB_FLAGS_HIGH_PRIORITY

</td>
<td>
Indicates that this IRB is to be processed as soon as possible, before non-high-priority IRBs currently in the ATA miniport.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`IrbStatus`

The miniport must set this member to indicates the status of the specified operation. The table below describes the various <b>IrbStatus</b> values and their meaning.
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<b>Value</b>

</td>
<td>
<b>Meaning</b>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRB_STATUS_PENDING

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the request is in progress. The port driver initializes <b>IrbStatus</b> to this value. A miniport driver should never set the <b>IrbStatus</b> member to this value.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRB_STATUS_SUCCESS

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the request was completed successfully.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRB_STATUS_DATALENGTH_MISMATCH

</td>
<td>
Indicates that a data underrun or overrun error occurred. The miniport must update the DataTransferLength field in the IRB to indicate the actual amount of data that was transferred in the case of an underrun.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRB_STATUS_DEVICE_ERROR

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the device returned an error. The miniport driver must update the <i>AtaStatus</i> and <i>AtaError</i> fields in the Irb to the contents of the device ATA status and error register at the completion of the command.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRB_STATUS_INVALID_REQUEST

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the miniport does not support the given request.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRB_STATUS_BUS_RESET

</td>
<td>
Indicates that a bus reset occurred while processing the given request.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRB_STATUS_SELECTION_TIMEOUT

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the destination device could not be selected.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRB_STATUS_BUSY

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the device is busy. The port driver retries any request completed with this status. A request completed with busy status is retried only once. It is the responsibility of the miniport driver to pause the request queue using <b>AtaPortDeviceBusy</b> if the device cannot handle request for a certain period of time.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRB_STATUS_AUTOSENSE_VALID

</td>
<td>
IRB_STATUS_AUTOSENSE_VALID is a bitmask that indicates valid sense data in the <i>SenseInfoBuffer</i> member of the IRB. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IRB_STATUS_RETURN_TASKFILE_VALID

</td>
<td>
IRB_STATUS_RETURN_TASKFILE_VALID is a bitmask that indicates a valid return task file in the <i>SenseInfoBuffer</i> member of the IRB.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`Lun`

Specifies the logical unit number of the device.

`NextIrb`

Pointer to the next IRB to be processed. The port driver sets this to <b>NULL</b>. The miniport driver can use this field to link IRBs together.

`QueueTag`

The queue tag for this IRB. The port driver sets this field to 0.

`Reserved`

Reserved for future use.

`ReservedAsUlong`

Reserved for future use.

`SenseInfoBuffer`

Pointer to the buffer which holds the sense data.

`SenseInfoBufferLength`

Specifies the length in bytes of the buffer pointed to by <b>SenseInfoBuffer</b>.

`SenseInfoBufferType`

Specifies the type of data structure returned in <b>SenseInfoBuffer</b>. Because ATA commands don't have a need for the request sense command, ATA_PASS_THROUGH commands use <b>SenseInfoBuffer</b> to return task file information. For ATA_PASS_THROUGH commands, as identified in the <b>IrbFlags</b> member, the appropriate return <b>TaskFile</b> size should be reported as either SENSE_INFO_BUFFER_RETURN_TYPE_28BIT_TASKFILE or

SENSE_INFO_BUFFER_RETURN_TYPE_48BIT_TASKFILE.

`TargetId`

Specifies the target ID of the device.

`TimeOutValue`

Indicates the time in seconds after which the request will time out.

## Remarks
The IDE_REQUEST_BLOCK structure provides a functionality similar to the <a href="..\srb\ns-srb-_scsi_request_block.md">SCSI_REQUEST_BLOCK</a> but with characteristics more suitable for managing devices on an IDE bus.
