# IDE_HW_INITIALIZE callback function
The <b><i>IdeHwInitialize</i></b> miniport driver routine configures the indicated device.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The ATA port driver and ATA miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## Syntax

```
IDE_HW_INITIALIZE IdeHwInitialize;

BOOLEAN IdeHwInitialize(
  PVOID ChannelExtension,
  PIDE_DEVICE_PARAMETERS DeviceParameters,
  PIDENTIFY_DEVICE_DATA IdentifyData
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`ChannelExtension`

A pointer to the miniport driver per channel device extension.

`DeviceParameters`

A pointer to a structure of type <a href="..\irb\ns-irb-_ide_device_parameters.md">IDE_DEVICE_PARAMETERS</a> that identifies the device to configure and the device parameters with which to configure the device.

`IdentifyData`

A pointer to a structure of type <a href="..\ata\ns-ata-_identify_device_data.md">IDENTIFY_DEVICE_DATA</a> that contains the identify data that is returned by the device.


## Return Value

<b><i>IdeHwInitialize</i></b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the operation succeeds. It returns <b>FALSE</b> if the operation fails.

## Remarks

After the miniport driver enumerates the devices on a channel, it calls the <b><i>IdeHwInitialize</i></b> routine one time for each device it enumerates. The <b><i>IdeHwInitialize</i></b> routine must configure each device based on the information that is specified in the <a href="..\irb\ns-irb-_ide_device_parameters.md">IDE_DEVICE_PARAMETERS</a> structure, pointed to by the <i>DeviceParameters</i> parameter. In exceptional cases, the miniport driver can configure the device by using a set of parameters that differ from those contained in <b>IDE_DEVICE_PARAMETERS</b>. In such cases, the miniport driver must update the information in <b>IDE_DEVICE_PARAMETERS</b> to contain the parameter value that it actually used to configure the device. After the <b><i>IdeHwInitialize</i></b> routine returns, the port driver updates its cached information with the parameter values that are provided by the miniport driver.
