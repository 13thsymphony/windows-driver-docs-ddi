# AtaPortSetBusData function



## -description
The <b>AtaPortSetBusData</b> routine stores the data at <i>Buffer </i>in the indicated device's PCI configuration space at an offset that is specified in <i>ConfigDataOffset</i>.



## -syntax

````
ULONG AtaPortSetBusData(
   IN PVOID ControllerExtension,
   IN PVOID Buffer,
   IN PVOID DataMask,
   IN ULONG ConfigDataOffset,
   IN ULONG BufferLength
);
````


## -parameters

### -param ControllerExtension 

A pointer to the controller extension.


### -param Buffer 

A pointer to the buffer that contains the data to write to the device's PCI bus configuration space.


### -param DataMask 

Contains a data mask buffer that controls which bits of PCI bus configuration data must be updated. The length of <i>Datamask </i>must be the same length as <i>Buffer.</i>


### -param ConfigDataOffset 

Specifies an offset into the device's PCI bus configuration data space where the data is updated.


### -param BufferLength 

Specifies the length, in bytes, of the buffer.


## -returns
<b>AtaPortSetBusData</b> returns the amount of the data that was written in bytes.


## -remarks
<b>AtaPortSetBusData</b> completes a bitwise OR, one byte at a time, of the current PCI configuration space data with the new data in <i>Buffer</i>. Only those bits not indicated by <i>DataMask</i> are left untouched. The byte of data that follows <i>ConfigDataOffset</i>, therefore, is updated as follows:
