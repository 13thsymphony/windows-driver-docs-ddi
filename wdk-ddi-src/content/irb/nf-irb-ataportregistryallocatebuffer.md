# AtaPortRegistryAllocateBuffer function
The <b>AtaPortRegistryAllocateBuffer</b> routine allocates a buffer for registry operations.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The ATA port driver and ATA miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## Syntax

````
PVOID AtaPortRegistryAllocateBuffer(
  _In_ PVOID ChannelExtension,
  _In_ ULONG Count
);
````

## Parameters

`ChannelExtension`

A pointer to the channel extension.

`BufferSize`

TBD


## Return Value

<b>AtaPortRegistryAllocateBuffer</b> returns a pointer to the allocated buffer on success. Otherwise, it returns <b>NULL</b>.

## Remarks

The port driver enables the miniport driver to allocate one buffer for all its registry operations. After the miniport driver has allocated a buffer with <b>AtaPortRegistryAllocateBuffer</b>, later calls to <b>AtaPortRegistryAllocateBuffer</b> will fail and return <b>NULL</b>. After the miniport driver frees the allocated buffer with a call to the <a href="..\irb\nf-irb-ataportregistryfreebuffer.md">AtaPortRegistryFreeBuffer</a> routine, it can again allocate buffers by calling <b>AtaPortRegistryAllocateBuffer</b>.

The miniport driver must call <b>AtaPortRegistryAllocateBuffer</b> either in its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550141">AtaChannelInitRoutine</a> routine or in its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557465">IdeHwControl</a> routine. It cannot call <b>AtaPortRegistryAllocateBuffer</b> from any other routine. Additionally, the miniport driver can only call <b>AtaPortRegistryAllocateBuffer</b> from its <b>IdeHwControl</b> routine if its <b>IdeHwControl</b> routine was called and had a value of either <b>StartChannel</b> or <b>StopChannel</b> in its <i>ControlAction </i>parameter.
