# IDE_HW_INTERRUPT callback



## -description
The <b><i>IdeHwInterrupt</i></b> miniport driver routine handles interrupts from the host bus adapter (HBA) to which the controller for the miniport driver is connected. 



## -prototype

````
IDE_HW_INTERRUPT IdeHwInterrupt;

BOOLEAN IdeHwInterrupt(
  _In_ PVOID ChannelExtension
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param ChannelExtension [in]

A pointer to the channel extension.


## -returns
<b><i>AtaHwInterrrupt</i></b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the interrupt is generated by one of the controller's channels. If a channel did not generate the interrupt, the routine should return <b>FALSE</b> as quickly as possible. 


## -remarks
The <b><i>IdeHwInterrupt</i></b> routine completes interrupt-driven I/O operations. 

If the indicated channel did not generate the interrupt, the miniport driver should make a second (recursive) call to the <b><i>IdeHwInterrupt</i></b> routine to handle interrupts that are intended for the controller's other channel.

If the miniport driver requires a large amount of time to process the interrupt, it must follow these steps:

Dismiss the interrupt on the HBA.

Disable interrupts on the channel that is indicated by the <i>ChannelExtension</i> parameter. 

Request a worker routine by using <a href="..\irb\nf-irb-ataportrequestworkerroutine.md">AtaPortRequestWorkerRoutine</a>. 

Complete additional processing in the worker routine.

Enable interrupts on the channel.

The following ATA port routines must not be called from the <b><i>IdeHwInterrupt</i></b> routine:


<a href="..\irb\nf-irb-ataportcompleteallactiverequests.md">AtaPortCompleteAllActiveRequests</a>



<a href="..\irb\nf-irb-ataportdevicebusy.md">AtaPortDeviceBusy</a>


However, the miniport driver can request a worker routine and make calls in the worker routine.

The worker routine must clear the interrupt on the HBA before it returns <b>TRUE</b>.
