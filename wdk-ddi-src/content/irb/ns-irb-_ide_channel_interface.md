# _IDE_CHANNEL_INTERFACE structure
The IDE_CHANNEL_INTERFACE structure contains interface information for the indicated channel.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The ATA port driver and ATA miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _IDE_CHANNEL_INTERFACE {
  USHORT            Version;
  UCHAR             ChannelNumber;
  UCHAR             Reserved;
  ULONG             ReservedUlong;
  IDE_HW_INITIALIZE IdeHwInitialize;
  IDE_HW_BUILDIO    IdeHwBuildIo;
  IDE_HW_STARTIO    IdeHwStartIo;
  IDE_HW_INTERRUPT  IdeHwInterrupt;
  IDE_HW_RESET      IdeHwReset;
  IDE_HW_CONTROL    IdeHwControl;
} IDE_CHANNEL_INTERFACE, *PIDE_CHANNEL_INTERFACE;
````

## Members


`ChannelNumber`

The port driver sets this field to the number assigned for this channel. For non-native mode controllers, the primary channel will always be assigned 0 and the secondary channel will always be assigned 1.

`IdeHwBuildIo`



`IdeHwControl`



`IdeHwInitialize`



`IdeHwInterrupt`



`IdeHwReset`



`IdeHwStartIo`



`Reserved`

Reserved for future use. The miniport driver must not use this field.

`ReservedUlong`

####

`Version`

The port driver sets this member to sizeof(IDE_CHANNEL_INTERFACE). The miniport driver should verify that the version is greater than or equal to the one it is using.
