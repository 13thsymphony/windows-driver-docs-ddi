# AtaPortRegistryControllerKeyWrite function
The <b>AtaPortRegistryControllerKeyWrite</b> routine writes the data to the indicated value name under the registry key <b>HKLM\CurrentControlSet\Services\</b><i>&lt;service name&gt;</i><b>\Controller</b><i>N</i>, where <i>N </i>is the number of the controller. 
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The ATA port driver and ATA miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## Syntax

````
BOOLEAN __inline AtaPortRegistryControllerKeyWrite(
  _In_ PVOID  ChannelExtension,
  _In_ UCHAR  ControllerNumber,
  _In_ PCHAR  ValueName,
  _In_ UCHAR  ValueType,
  _In_ PUCHAR Buffer,
  _In_ PULONG Length
);
````

## Parameters

`ChannelExtension`

A pointer to the channel extension.

`ControllerNumber`

Contains the controller number.

`ValueName`

Contains the name of the registry value to write to.

`ValueType`

Indicates the type of data that is contained in the registry value. This member should be assigned one of the values indicated in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IDE_REG_DWORD

</td>
<td>
A 4-byte numeric value. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IDE_REG_BINARY

</td>
<td>
Binary data. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IDE_REG_SZ

</td>
<td>
A null-terminated, Unicode string. 

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`Buffer`

A pointer to the source buffer that contains the data to write to the registry value.

`BufferLength`

TBD


## Return Value

<b>AtaPortRegistryControllerKeyWrite</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, it returns <b>FALSE</b>. The routine also returns <b>FALSE</b> if the miniport driver does not call it from the correct routine.

## Remarks

The buffer should be allocated by using <a href="..\irb\nf-irb-ataportregistryallocatebuffer.md">AtaPortRegistryAllocateBuffer</a>. 

The miniport driver must call <b>AtaPortRegistryControllerKeyWrite</b> during the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550141">AtaChannelInitRoutine</a> routine or the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557465">IdeHwControl</a> routine.; The miniport driver cannot call <b>AtaPortRegistryControllerKeyWrite</b> from any other routine or it will return <b>FALSE</b>. Additionally, the miniport driver can only call <b>AtaPortRegistryControllerKeyWrite</b> from its <b>IdeHwControl</b> routine if its <b>IdeHwControl</b> routine was called and had a value of either <b>StartChannel</b> or <b>StopChannel</b> in its <i>ControlAction </i>parameter.
