# IDE_HW_STARTIO callback function
The <b><i>IdeHwStartIo</i></b> miniport driver routine processes the synchronized aspects of an I/O request.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The ATA port driver and ATA miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## Syntax

```
IDE_HW_STARTIO IdeHwStartio;

BOOLEAN IdeHwStartio(
  PVOID ChannelExtension,
  PIDE_REQUEST_BLOCK Irb
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`ChannelExtension`

A pointer to the miniport driver per channel device extension.

`Irb`

A pointer to a structure of type <a href="..\irb\ns-irb-_ide_request_block.md">IDE_REQUEST_BLOCK</a> that defines the IDE request block (IRB) to process.


## Return Value

<b><i>IdeHwStartIo</i></b> returns <b>TRUE</b> to acknowledge the receipt of an IRB. The port driver ignores a return value of <b>FALSE</b>.

## Remarks

Miniport drivers must provide an <b><i>IdeHwStartIo</i></b> routine to process the aspects of an I/O request that must be handled synchronously. For information about how the miniport driver processes the unsynchronized aspects of an I/O request, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557462">IdeHwBuildIo</a>. 

After the miniport driver receives the <b><i>IdeHwStartIo</i></b> call, it owns the request and must complete it.

After this routine returns, the miniport driver should be prepared to receive the next request from the port driver immediately.
