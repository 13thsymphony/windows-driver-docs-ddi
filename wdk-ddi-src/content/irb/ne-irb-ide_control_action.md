# IDE_CONTROL_ACTION Enumeration
The IDE_CONTROL_ACTION enumeration type indicates the control action to be performed by a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557465">IdeHwControl</a> routine.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The ATA port driver and ATA miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>
