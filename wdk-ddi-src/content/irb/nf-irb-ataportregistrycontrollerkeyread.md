# AtaPortRegistryControllerKeyRead function
The <b>AtaPortRegistryControllerKeyRead</b> routine reads the data that is associated with the indicated value name under the registry key <b>HKLM\CurrentControlSet\Services\</b><i>&lt;service name&gt;</i><b>\Controller</b><i>N</i>, where <i>N </i>is the number of the controller.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The ATA port driver and ATA miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## Syntax

````
BOOLEAN __inline AtaPortRegistryControllerKeyRead(
  _In_      PVOID  ChannelExtension,
  _In_      UCHAR  ControllerNumber,
  _In_      PCHAR  ValueName,
  _In_      UCHAR  ValueType,
  _Out_opt_ PUCHAR Buffer,
  _Inout_   PULONG Length
);
````

## Parameters

`ChannelExtension`

A pointer to the channel extension.

`ControllerNumber`

Contains the controller number.

`ValueName`

Contains the name of the registry value to read.

`ValueType`

Indicates the type of the data that is contained in the registry value. This parameter should be assigned one of values indicated in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value type</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IDE_REG_DWORD

</td>
<td>
A 4-byte numeric value. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IDE_REG_BINARY

</td>
<td>
Binary data. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IDE_REG_SZ

</td>
<td>
A null-terminated, Unicode string. 

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`Buffer`

A pointer to the buffer where the results are to be copied.

`BufferLength`

TBD


## Return Value

<b>AtaPortRegistryControllerKeyRead</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, it returns <b>FALSE</b>. The <b>AtaPortRegistryControllerKeyRead</b> routine also returns <b>FALSE</b> if the miniport driver does not call it from the correct routine.

## Remarks

The buffer at <i>Buffer</i> must be allocated by using <a href="..\irb\nf-irb-ataportregistryallocatebuffer.md">AtaPortRegistryAllocateBuffer</a>. 

The miniport driver must call <b>AtaPortRegistryControllerKeyRead</b> either in its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550141">AtaChannelInitRoutine</a> routine or in its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557465">IdeHwControl</a> routine. It cannot call <b>AtaPortRegistryControllerKeyRead</b> from any other routine. Additionally, the miniport driver can only call <b>AtaPortRegistryControllerKeyRead</b> from its <b>IdeHwControl</b> routine if its <b>IdeHwControl</b> routine was called and had a value of either <b>StartChannel</b> or <b>StopChannel</b> in its <i>ControlAction </i>parameter.
