# IDE_CHANNEL_INIT callback



## -description
The <b><i>AtaChannelInitRoutine</i></b> miniport driver routine initializes the miniport driver's channel interface.



## -prototype

````
IDE_CHANNEL_INIT AtaChannelInitRoutine;

BOOLEAN AtaChannelInitRoutine(
  _In_    PVOID                  ChannelExtension,
  _Inout_ PIDE_CHANNEL_INTERFACE ChannelInterface,
  _Inout_ PVOID                  Context
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param ChannelExtension [in]

A pointer to the miniport driver channel extension.


### -param ChannelInterface [in, out]

A pointer to a structure of type <a href="storage.ide_channel_interface">IDE_CHANNEL_INTERFACE</a>. 


### -param Context [in, out]

A pointer to the controller extension.


## -returns
<b><i>AtaChannelInitRoutine</i></b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the initialization succeeded. It returns <b>FALSE</b> if the initialization failed. 


## -remarks
A vendor-supplied miniport driver that supports the channel interface must implement an <b><i>AtaChannelInitRoutine</i></b> routine to initialize the controller's channels. In particular, the <b><i>AtaChannelInitRoutine</i></b> routine must complete the initialization of the <a href="storage.ide_channel_interface">IDE_CHANNEL_INTERFACE</a> structure. The following sequence describes how the miniport driver and the port driver interact to initialize a channel: 

While in its <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-driver_initialize.md">DriverEntry</a> routine, the miniport driver calls the port driver's <a href="storage.ataportinitializeex">AtaPortInitializeEx</a> library routine to launch the initialization of the controller and the miniport driver. 

If the miniport driver supports the channel interface, the <b><i>DriverEntry</i></b> routine must initialize the <b>AtaChannelInitRoutine</b> member of <a href="storage.ide_controller_interface">IDE_CONTROLLER_INTERFACE</a> to point to the miniport driver's <b><i>AtaChannelInitRoutine</i></b> routine.

The port driver calls the <b><i>AtaAdapterControl</i></b> routine by using control action IdeStart. <b><i>AtaChannelInitRoutine</i></b> is called one time for every NumberOfChannels specified in the ControllerConfiguration structure that is returned by the <b><i>AtaAdapterControl</i></b> routine when <b><i>AtaAdapterControl</i></b> handles an <b>IdeStart</b> action.
