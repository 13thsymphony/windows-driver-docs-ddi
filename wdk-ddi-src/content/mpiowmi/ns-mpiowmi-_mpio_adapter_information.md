typedef struct _MPIO_ADAPTER_INFORMATION {
  ULONGLONG PathId;
  UCHAR     BusNumber;
  UCHAR     DeviceNumber;
  UCHAR     FunctionNumber;
  UCHAR     Pad;

## -struct-fields

### -field PathId

An unsigned 64-bitfield that represents an identifier that is assigned to a particular path. This field will match the PathIdentifier field in the instance(s) of the PDO_INFORMATION class that represent device(s) exposed via this path.


### -field BusNumber

An unsigned 8-bitfield that corresponds to the bus number that is assigned by PCI to the host bus adapter through which this path is exposed.


### -field DeviceNumber

An unsigned 8-bitfield that corresponds to the device number that is assigned by PCI to the host bus adapter through which this path is exposed.


### -field FunctionNumber

An unsigned 8-bitfield that corresponds to the function number that is assigned by PCI to the host bus adapter through which this path is exposed.


### -field Pad

Should be zero.


### -field AdapterName

A string field that returns the friendly name of the host bus adapter through which this path is exposed.
