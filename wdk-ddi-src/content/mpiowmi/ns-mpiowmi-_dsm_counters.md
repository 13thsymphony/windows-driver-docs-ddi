# _DSM_COUNTERS structure



## -description
The DSM_COUNTERS structure holds the various timer counters that are applicable to all LUNs that are controlled by the DSM.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _DSM_COUNTERS {
  ULONG     PathVerifyEnabled;
  ULONG     PathVerificationPeriod;
  ULONG     PDORemovePeriod;
  ULONG     RetryCount;

## -struct-fields

### -field PathVerifyEnabled

An unsigned 32-bitfield that is used as a flag. This field indicates if path verification must be performed by MPIO periodically on all paths that expose devices that are controlled by this particular DSM.


### -field PathVerificationPeriod

An unsigned 32-bitfield that is used to indicate the periodicity (in seconds) with which MPIO has been requested to perform path verification. This field is only honored if <i>PathVerifyEnabled</i> is <b>TRUE</b>.


### -field PDORemovePeriod

An unsigned 32-bitfield that controls the amount of time (in seconds) that the pseudo-LUN will continue to remain in system memory, even after losing all its path information.


### -field RetryCount

An unsigned 32-bitfield that specifies the number of times a failed I/O will be retried.


### -field RetryInterval

An unsigned 32-bitfield that specifies the interval of time (in seconds) after which a failed request is retried.


### -field Reserved32

Should be zero.


### -field Reserved64

Should be zero.
