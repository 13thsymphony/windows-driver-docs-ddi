## -syntax

````
typedef struct _MPIO_PATH_INFORMATION {
  ULONG                    NumberPaths;
  ULONG                    Pad;
  MPIO_ADAPTER_INFORMATION PathList[1];
} MPIO_PATH_INFORMATION, *PMPIO_PATH_INFORMATION;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field NumberPaths

An unsigned 32-bitfield that represents the total number of paths that MPIO is aware of.

### -field Pad

Should be zero.

### -field PathList

An array that returns information about each of the paths. The number of elements in the array is given by <i>NumberPaths</i> and each element of the array represents an instance of an MPIO_ADAPTER_INFORMATION structure.
