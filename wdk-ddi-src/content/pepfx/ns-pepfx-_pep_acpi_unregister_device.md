## Syntax
````

  PEPHANDLE DeviceHandle;
  ULONG     InputFlags;
} PEP_ACPI_UNREGISTER_DEVICE, *PPEP_ACPI_UNREGISTER_DEVICE;
````

## Members

        
            `DeviceHandle`

            [in] A PEPHANDLE value that identifies the device's registration for ACPI services. The platform extension plug-in (PEP) supplied this handle in response to a previous <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186689">PEP_NOTIFY_ACPI_REGISTER_DEVICE</a> notification.
        
            `InputFlags`

            [in] A set of input flags. No flags are currently defined for this member, which is always set to PEP_ACPI_UNREGISTER_DEVICE_INPUT_FLAG_NONE (0x0).

    ## Remarks
        This structure is used by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/using-peps-for-acpi-services">PEP_NOTIFY_ACPI_UNREGISTER_DEVICE</a> notification. The <b>DeviceHandle</b> and <b>InputFlags</b> members contain input values that are supplied by the Windows <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/B08F8ABF-FD43-434C-A345-337FBB799D9B">power management framework</a> when this notification is sent.
