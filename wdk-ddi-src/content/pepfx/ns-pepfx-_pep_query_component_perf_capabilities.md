# _PEP_QUERY_COMPONENT_PERF_CAPABILITIES structure
The <b>PEP_QUERY_COMPONENT_PERF_CAPABILITIES</b> structure specifies the number of performance state (P-state) sets that are defined for a component.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PEP_QUERY_COMPONENT_PERF_CAPABILITIES {
  PEPHANDLE DeviceHandle;
  ULONG     Component;
  ULONG     SetCount;
} PEP_QUERY_COMPONENT_PERF_CAPABILITIES, *PPEP_QUERY_COMPONENT_PERF_CAPABILITIES;
````

## Members


`Component`

[in] The index that identifies the component. This member is an index into the <b>Components</b> array in the <a href="..\pepfx\ns-pepfx-_pep_device_register_v2.md">PEP_DEVICE_REGISTER_V2</a> structure that the PEP previously supplied in response to the <b>PEP_DPM_REGISTER_DEVICE</b> notification for this device. If the <b>Components</b> array contains N elements, component indexes range from 0 to N–1.

`DeviceHandle`

[in] A PEPHANDLE value that identifies the device. The PEP supplied this handle in response to a previous <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186849">PEP_DPM_REGISTER_DEVICE</a> notification.

`SetCount`

[out] The number of P-state sets that are defined for this component.

## Remarks
This structure is used by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186839">PEP_DPM_QUERY_COMPONENT_PERF_CAPABILITIES</a> notification. The <b>DeviceHandle</b> and <b>Component</b> members contain input values that are supplied by the Windows <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/B08F8ABF-FD43-434C-A345-337FBB799D9B">power management framework</a> (PoFx) when this notification is sent. The <b>SetCount</b> member contains an output value that the PEP writes to the structure in response to the notification.
