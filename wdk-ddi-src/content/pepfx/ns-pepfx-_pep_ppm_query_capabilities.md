# _PEP_PPM_QUERY_CAPABILITIES structure
The <b>PEP_PPM_QUERY_CAPABILITIES</b> structure contains information about the processor power management (PPM) capabilities of the platform extension plug-in (PEP).

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PEP_PPM_QUERY_CAPABILITIES {
  ULONG   FeedbackCounterCount;
  ULONG   IdleStateCount;
  BOOLEAN PerformanceStatesSupported;
  BOOLEAN ParkingSupported;
} PEP_PPM_QUERY_CAPABILITIES, *PPEP_PPM_QUERY_CAPABILITIES;
````

## Members


`DiscretePerformanceStateCount`



`FeedbackCounterCount`

[out] The number of processor performance feedback counters supported by the PEP for this processor. On x86/AMD64 platforms, this must be zero.

`IdleStateCount`

[out] The number of processor idle states that the PEP supports. The PEP is not required to support the same number of idle states for all processors. The PEP can set <b>IdleStateCount</b> = 0 to indicate that it doesn't support any idle states, in which case the PEP doesn't need to implement any other notifications that deal with processor idle states.

`ParkingSupported`

[out] Whether the PEP supports supplying core parking hints. Set to TRUE if the PEP can indicate which cores to park, or to FALSE if it cannot.

`PerformanceStatesSupported`

[out] Whether the PEP supports performance state controls. Set to TRUE if the PEP supports performance states, or to FALSE if it does not.

## Remarks
This structure is used by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186820">PEP_NOTIFY_PPM_QUERY_CAPABILITIES</a> notification. All four members contain output values that the PEP writes to the structure in response to this notification.

## Requirements
