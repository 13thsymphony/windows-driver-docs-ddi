# _PEP_PPM_QUERY_COORDINATED_STATES structure
The <b>PEP_PPM_QUERY_COORDINATED_STATES</b> structure contains information about each coordinated idle state that the platform extension plug-in (PEP) supports.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PEP_PPM_QUERY_COORDINATED_STATES {
  ULONG                                          Count;
  _Field_size_(Count) PEP_COORDINATED_IDLE_STATE States[ANYSIZE_ARRAY];
} PEP_PPM_QUERY_COORDINATED_STATES, *PPEP_PPM_QUERY_COORDINATED_STATES;
````

## Members


`Count`

[in] The size of the <b>States</b> array. This will be equal to the <b>PlatformStateCount</b> returned from the query platform states notification.

`States`

[out] An array of <a href="..\pepfx\ns-pepfx-_pep_coordinated_idle_state.md">PEP_COORDINATED_IDLE_STATE</a> structures that contains information about each coordinated idle state that the PEP supports.


## Requirements
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows version** | Supported starting with Windows 10. Supported starting with Windows 10. |
| **Header** | pepfx.h (include Pep_x.h) |
