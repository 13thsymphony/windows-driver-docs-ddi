  POHANDLE DeviceHandle;
  ULONG    NotifyCode;
} PEP_WORK_ACPI_NOTIFY, *PPEP_WORK_ACPI_NOTIFY;

## Members


`DeviceHandle`

A POHANDLE value that represents the registration of the device with PoFx. The platform extension plug-in (PEP) previously received this handle from the Windows <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/B08F8ABF-FD43-434C-A345-337FBB799D9B">power management framework</a> (PoFx) during the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186689">PEP_NOTIFY_ACPI_REGISTER_DEVICE</a> notification in which the PEP elected to provide ACPI services for the device.

`NotifyCode`

The Notify code. For a list of Notify codes and their meanings, see section 5.6.6, "Device Object Notifications", of the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface Specification, Revision 5.0 (<a href="http://www.acpi.info">ACPI 5.0 specification</a>).

## Remarks
The <b>AcpiNotify</b> member of the <a href="..\pepfx\ns-pepfx-_pep_work_information.md">PEP_WORK_INFORMATION</a> structure is a <b>PEP_WORK_ACPI_NOTIFY</b> structure.
