# _PEP_PPM_IDLE_COMPLETE_V2 structure



## -description
The <b>PEP_PPM_IDLE_COMPLETE_V2</b> structure describe the idle states from which the processor and hardware platform are waking.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _PEP_PPM_IDLE_COMPLETE_V2 {
  ULONG ProcessorState;
  ULONG PlatformState;
} PEP_PPM_IDLE_COMPLETE_V2, *PPEP_PPM_IDLE_COMPLETE_V2;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field ProcessorState

[in] An index that identifies the idle state from which the processor is waking. The platform extension plug-in (PEP) previously specified the supported processor idle states in response to a <a href="kernel.pep_notify_ppm_query_idle_states_v2">PEP_NOTIFY_PPM_QUERY_IDLE_STATES_V2</a> notification. If the PEP specified N processor idle states, valid processor-idle-state indexes range from 0 to N-1. When the hypervisor is enabled and the platform wakes from an idle state, this member is set to <b>PEP_PROCESSOR_IDLE_STATE_UNKNOWN</b> (0xffffffff). For more information, see <a href="kernel.pep_notify_ppm_idle_complete">PEP_NOTIFY_PPM_IDLE_COMPLETE</a>.


### -field PlatformState

[in] An index that identifies the idle state from which the platform is waking. The PEP previously specified the supported platform idle states in response to a <a href="kernel.pep_notify_ppm_query_platform_states">PEP_NOTIFY_PPM_QUERY_PLATFORM_STATES</a> notification. If the PEP specified M platform idle states, valid platform-idle-state indexes range from 0 to M-1. If the transition from the processor idle state does not involve a transition from an platform idle state, this member will contain the value <b>PEP_PLATFORM_IDLE_STATE_NONE</b> (0xffffffff).


## -remarks
This structure is used by the <a href="kernel.pep_notify_ppm_idle_complete">PEP_NOTIFY_PPM_IDLE_COMPLETE</a> notification. The <b>ProcessorState</b> and <b>PlatformState</b> members contain input values that are supplied by the Windows <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/B08F8ABF-FD43-434C-A345-337FBB799D9B">power management framework</a> (PoFx) when this notification is sent to the PEP.</p>
