# _PEP_PPM_IDLE_COMPLETE structure
The <b>PEP_PPM_IDLE_COMPLETE</b> structure describe the idle states from which the processor and hardware platform are waking.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PEP_PPM_IDLE_COMPLETE {
  ULONG ProcessorState;
  ULONG PlatformState;
} PEP_PPM_IDLE_COMPLETE, *PPEP_PPM_IDLE_COMPLETE;
````

## Members


`PlatformState`

[in] An index that identifies the idle state from which the platform is waking. The PEP previously specified the supported platform idle states in response to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186827">PEP_NOTIFY_PPM_QUERY_PLATFORM_STATES</a> notification. If the PEP specified M platform idle states, valid platform-idle-state indexes range from 0 to M-1. If the transition from the processor idle state does not involve a transition from an platform idle state, this member will contain the value <b>PEP_PLATFORM_IDLE_STATE_NONE</b> (0xffffffff).

`ProcessorState`

[in] An index that identifies the idle state from which the processor is waking. The platform extension plug-in (PEP) previously specified the supported processor idle states in response to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186824">PEP_NOTIFY_PPM_QUERY_IDLE_STATES_V2</a> notification. If the PEP specified N processor idle states, valid processor-idle-state indexes range from 0 to N-1. When the hypervisor is enabled and the platform wakes from an idle state, this member is set to <b>PEP_PROCESSOR_IDLE_STATE_UNKNOWN</b> (0xffffffff). For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186803">PEP_NOTIFY_PPM_IDLE_COMPLETE</a>.

## Remarks
This structure is used by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186803">PEP_NOTIFY_PPM_IDLE_COMPLETE</a> notification. The <b>ProcessorState</b> and <b>PlatformState</b> members contain input values that are supplied by the Windows <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/B08F8ABF-FD43-434C-A345-337FBB799D9B">power management framework</a> (PoFx) when this notification is sent to the PEP.
