# POFXCALLBACKPROCESSORHALT callback



## -description
The <b>ProcessorHalt</b> routine prepares the processor to be halted.



## -prototype

````
POFXCALLBACKPROCESSORHALT ProcessorHalt;

NTSTATUS ProcessorHalt(
  _In_        ULONG                   Flags,
  _Inout_opt_ PVOID                   Context,
  _In_        PPROCESSOR_HALT_ROUTINE Halt
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param Flags [in]

Flags that indicate the properties of the idle state that the processor will enter. The <i>Flags</i> parameter is set to zero or to the bitwise-OR of one or more of the following flag bits.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag name</th>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PROCESSOR_HALT_CACHE_FLUSH_OVERRIDE</td>
<td>0x01</td>
<td>The PEP's <i>Halt</i> callback routine is responsible for flushing the processor's caches. If this flag is <u>not</u> set, <b>ProcessorHalt</b> will flush the caches on entry to the processor idle state, and will invalidate the caches on exit from this state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PROCESSOR_HALT_CACHE_COHERENT</td>
<td>0x02</td>
<td>Prepare the processor to enter an idle state in which the processor's caches will remain coherent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PROCESSOR_HALT_CONTEXT_RETAINED</td>
<td>0x04</td>
<td>Prepare the processor to enter an idle state in which the processor's thread context will be preserved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PROCESSOR_HALT_RETURN_NOT_SAFE</td>
<td>0x08</td>
<td>The PEP's <i>Halt</i> callback routine is guaranteed to not return. Set this flag if the <i>Halt</i> callback transitions the processor to a context-losing, power-gated state that cannot be canceled by hardware. When this flag is set, the operating system will treat a return from the <i>Halt</i> callback as a fatal error.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PROCESSOR_HALT_VIA_PSCI_CPU_SUSPEND</td>
<td>0x16</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -param Context [in, out, optional]

A pointer to a PEP-defined processor-halt context. This pointer is passed as a parameter to the <i>Halt</i> callback routine. This context is opaque to the Windows <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/B08F8ABF-FD43-434C-A345-337FBB799D9B">power management framework</a> (PoFx).


### -param Halt [in]

A pointer to a PEP-implemented <i>Halt</i> callback routine. PoFx calls this routine after preparations to halt the processor have been completed. During this callback, the PEP is expected to transition the processor to the <i>halted</i> state.


## -returns
<b>ProcessorHalt</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the processor is successfully prepared to be halted. Possible error return values include the following status code.
<dl>
<dt>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</dt>
</dl>The <i>Halt</i> parameter is NULL; or an invalid flag value was specified in <i>Flags</i>; or <i>Flags</i> contains an illegal combination of flag bits. For more information, see Remarks.
<dl>
<dt>STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL</dt>
</dl>The PEP's <i>Halt</i> callback routine unexpectedly returned from an idle state in which the processor's hardware context was not preserved.

 


## -remarks
This routine is implemented by the power management framework (PoFx) and is called by the platform extension plug-in (PEP). The <b>ProcessorHalt</b> member of the <a href="..\pepfx\ns-pepfx-_pep_kernel_information_struct_v3.md">PEP_KERNEL_INFORMATION_STRUCT_V3</a> structure is a pointer to a <b>ProcessorHalt</b> routine.

Before halting the processor, the PEP calls the <b>ProcessorHalt</b> routine to give PoFx an opportunity to save the processor's hardware context. If necessary, <b>ProcessorHalt</b> saves this state internally in PoFx so that the state can later be restored when the processor exits the idle state. After preparing the processor to enter the idle state, <b>ProcessorHalt</b> calls the PEP's <i>Halt</i> callback routine to halt the processor.

As part of the PEP's handling of a  <a href="kernel.pep_notify_ppm_idle_execute">PEP_NOTIFY_PPM_IDLE_EXECUTE</a> notification, the PEP must transition the processor to the idle state that the PEP has selected. The following are the two ways to enter the processor idle state:

The following combinations of flag bits are illegal:

PROCESSOR_HALT_CONTEXT_RETAINED = 1 and PROCESSOR_HALT_RETURN_NOT_SAFE = 1

The PEP's <i>Halt</i> callback routine must return from any state in which context      is retained.

PROCESSOR_HALT_CACHE_FLUSH_OVERRIDE = 1 and PROCESSOR_HALT_CACHE_COHERENT = 1

The cache-flush-override flag should be set <u>only</u> if entering an idle state      that is not cache coherent.

PROCESSOR_HALT_CACHE_FLUSH_OVERRIDE = 0 and PROCESSOR_HALT_CACHE_COHERENT = 0

The cache-flush-override flag must be set for any non-cache coherent halt.

PROCESSOR_HALT_CONTEXT_RETAINED = 0 and PROCESSOR_HALT_CACHE_COHERENT = 1

Any idle states that lose processor hardware context (and therefore use the <a href="https://acpica.org/sites/acpica/files/MP Startup for ARM platforms.doc">multiprocessor parking protocol</a> to exit the idle state and return control to the operating system) are not cache-coherent states.

If the <i>Flags</i> parameter contains an illegal combination of flag bits, <b>ProcessorHalt</b> fails and returns STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.

The PEP can call this routine at IRQL &lt;= HIGH_LEVEL.
