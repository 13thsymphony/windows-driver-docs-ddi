# _PEP_SYSTEM_LATENCY structure
The <b>PEP_SYSTEM_LATENCY</b> structure specifies the new value for the system latency tolerance.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PEP_SYSTEM_LATENCY {
  ULONGLONG Latency;
} PEP_SYSTEM_LATENCY, *PPEP_SYSTEM_LATENCY;
````

## Members


`Latency`

[in] The overall system latency tolerance, in 100-nanosecond units. This member specifies the maximum latency that the operating system can tolerate in the time required to move a component from a low-power F<i>x</i> state to F0.

## Remarks
This structure is used by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186856">PEP_DPM_SYSTEM_LATENCY_UPDATE</a> notification. The <b>Latency</b> member of the structure contains an input value that is supplied by the Windows <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9F2D8ACD-44D5-46E0-9FC7-1B38B99450FF">power management framework</a> (PoFx).

## Requirements
