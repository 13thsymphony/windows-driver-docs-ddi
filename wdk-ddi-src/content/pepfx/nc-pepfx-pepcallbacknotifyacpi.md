# PEPCALLBACKNOTIFYACPI function



## -description
An <i>AcceptAcpiNotification</i> event callback routine handles ACPI notifications from the Windows <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/B08F8ABF-FD43-434C-A345-337FBB799D9B">power management framework</a> (PoFx).



## -syntax

````
PEPCALLBACKNOTIFYACPI AcceptAcpiNotification;

BOOLEAN AcceptAcpiNotification(
  _In_        ULONG Notification,
  _Inout_opt_ PVOID Data
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param Notification [in]

The ACPI notification ID. This parameter specifies the type of ACPI notification that PoFx is sending. For a list of ACPI notification IDs, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt186628">ACPI notifications</a>.


### -param Data [in, out, optional]

A pointer to a PoFx-allocated structure that contains the input and/or output data for this notification. The type of this structure depends on the notification ID specified by <i>Notification</i>. For a list of the structure types that are defined for the various ACPI notification IDs, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt186628">ACPI notifications</a>.


## -returns
The <i>AcceptAcpiNotification</i> routine must return TRUE if it handles the notification, or FALSE if it does not.


## -remarks
This routine is implemented by the platform extension plug-in (PEP) for a device. The <b>AcceptAcpiNotification</b> member of the <a href="..\pepfx\ns-pepfx-_pep_information.md">PEP_INFORMATION</a> structure is a pointer to an <i>AcceptAcpiNotification</i> routine. The PEP calls the <a href="..\pepfx\nf-pepfx-pofxregisterplugin.md">PoFxRegisterPlugin</a> or <a href="..\pepfx\nf-pepfx-pofxregisterpluginex.md">PoFxRegisterPluginEx</a> routine to register the PEP's <i>AcceptAcpiNotification</i> routine with PoFx.

The IRQL at which the PEP's <i>AcceptAcpiNotification</i> routine is called varies according to the type of notification that is being sent. The notification type is specified by the <i>Notification</i> parameter. For more information about the IRQL at which each notification type is sent, see the individual reference pages under <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt186628">ACPI notifications</a>.
