# _PEP_PPM_QUERY_FEEDBACK_COUNTERS structure
The <b>PEP_PPM_QUERY_FEEDBACK_COUNTERS</b> structure describes all the processor performance counters that the platform extension plug-in (PEP) supports for a particular processor.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PEP_PPM_QUERY_FEEDBACK_COUNTERS {
  ULONG                          Count;
  PEP_PROCESSOR_FEEDBACK_COUNTER Counters[ANYSIZE_ARRAY];
} PEP_PPM_QUERY_FEEDBACK_COUNTERS, *PPEP_PPM_QUERY_FEEDBACK_COUNTERS;
````

## Members


`Count`

[in] The number of processor performance feedback counters supported by the PEP. The PEP previously supplied this count in response to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186820">PEP_NOTIFY_PPM_QUERY_CAPABILITIES</a> notification.

`Counters`

[out] The first element in an array of <a href="..\pepfx\ns-pepfx-_pep_processor_feedback_counter.md">PEP_PROCESSOR_FEEDBACK_COUNTER</a> structures. If this array contains more than one element, the additional elements immediately follow the end of the <b>PEP_PPM_QUERY_FEEDBACK_COUNTERS</b> structure. The <b>Count</b> member specifies the number of elements in this array. For more information, see Remarks.

## Remarks
This structure is used by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186823">PEP_NOTIFY_PPM_QUERY_FEEDBACK_COUNTERS</a> notification. The <b>Count</b> member of the structure contains an input value that PoFx supplies when this notification is sent. The <b>Counters</b> member contains an output value that the PEP writes in response to the notification. The PEP writes any additional <b>Counters</b> array elements to the output buffer area that follows the <b>PEP_PPM_QUERY_FEEDBACK_COUNTERS</b> structure. The buffer that PoFx allocated for this structure is guaranteed to be large enough to contain any array elements that follow the structure.

## Requirements

| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows version** | Supported starting with Windows 10. Supported starting with Windows 10. |
