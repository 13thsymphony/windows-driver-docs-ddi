# _PEP_DEVICE_PLATFORM_CONSTRAINTS structure
The <b>PEP_DEVICE_PLATFORM_CONSTRAINTS</b> structure specifies the constraints for entry to the various D<i>x</i> power states that are supported by a device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PEP_DEVICE_PLATFORM_CONSTRAINTS {
  PEPHANDLE           DeviceHandle;
  PDEVICE_POWER_STATE MinimumDStates;
  ULONG               PlatformStateCount;
} PEP_DEVICE_PLATFORM_CONSTRAINTS, *PPEP_DEVICE_PLATFORM_CONSTRAINTS;
````

## Members


`DeviceHandle`

[in] A PEPHANDLE value that identifies the device. The PEP supplied this handle in response to a previous <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186849">PEP_DPM_REGISTER_DEVICE</a> notification.

`MinimumDStates`

[in] A pointer to an array of <a href="..\wudfddi\ne-wudfddi-_device_power_state.md">DEVICE_POWER_STATE</a> enumeration values that indicate the lowest-powered D<i>x</i> (device power) state the device can enter for each platform idle state.

`PlatformStateCount`

[in] The number of elements in the array pointed to by the <b>MinimumDStates</b> member. This member contains the platform state count that the PEP supplied in response to a previous <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186827">PEP_NOTIFY_PPM_QUERY_PLATFORM_STATES</a> notification.

## Remarks
This structure is used by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186704">PEP_DPM_DEVICE_IDLE_CONSTRAINTS</a> notification. All three members of this structure contain input values that are supplied by the Windows power management framework (PoFx). In response to this notification, the PEP writes <a href="..\wudfddi\ne-wudfddi-_device_power_state.md">DEVICE_POWER_STATE</a> enumeration values to the elements of the array pointed to by the <b>MinimumDStates</b> member. PoFx allocates the storage for this array before sending the notification.
