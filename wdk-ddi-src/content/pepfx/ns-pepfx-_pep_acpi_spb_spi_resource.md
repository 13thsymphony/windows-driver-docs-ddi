# _PEP_ACPI_SPB_SPI_RESOURCE structure
The <b>PEP_ACPI_SPB_SPI_RESOURCE</b> structure describes an ACPI SPI serial bus resource.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PEP_ACPI_SPB_SPI_RESOURCE {
  PEP_ACPI_SPB_RESOURCE SpbCommon;
  ULONG                 ConnectionSpeed;
  UCHAR                 DataBitLength;
  UCHAR                 Phase;
  UCHAR                 Polarity;
  USHORT                DeviceSelection;
} PEP_ACPI_SPB_SPI_RESOURCE, *PPEP_ACPI_SPB_SPI_RESOURCE;
````

## Members


`ConnectionSpeed`

The maximum speed, in hertz, supported by this connection.

`DataBitLength`

The size, in bits, of the smallest unit of transfer.

`DeviceSelection`

The device selection value. This value is
specific to the device and may refer to a chip-select line, GPIO
line, or other line selection mechanism.

`Phase`

The phase of the clock pulse on which to capture data.

`Polarity`

The polarity of the clock. If zero, this indicates the
clock is low during the first phase. If 1, this indicates the
clock is high during the first phase.

`SpbCommon`

A <a href="..\pepfx\ns-pepfx-_pep_acpi_spb_resource.md">PEP_ACPI_SPB_RESOURCE</a> structure describing this resource.
