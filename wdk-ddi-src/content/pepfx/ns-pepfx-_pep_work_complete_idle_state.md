# _PEP_WORK_COMPLETE_IDLE_STATE structure
The <b>PEP_WORK_COMPLETE_IDLE_STATE</b> structure identifies a component that the platform extension plug-in (PEP) has prepared for a transition to a new F<i>x</i> power state.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PEP_WORK_COMPLETE_IDLE_STATE {
  POHANDLE DeviceHandle;
  ULONG    Component;
} PEP_WORK_COMPLETE_IDLE_STATE, *PPEP_WORK_COMPLETE_IDLE_STATE;
````

## Members


`Component`

[in] The index that identifies the component. This member is an index into the <b>Components</b> array in the <a href="..\pepfx\ns-pepfx-_pep_device_register_v2.md">PEP_DEVICE_REGISTER_V2</a> structure that the PEP previously supplied in response to the <b>PEP_DPM_REGISTER_DEVICE</b> notification for this device. If the <b>Components</b> array contains N elements, component indexes range from 0 to N–1.

`DeviceHandle`

A handle that represents the registration of the device with the Windows <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9F2D8ACD-44D5-46E0-9FC7-1B38B99450FF">power management framework</a> (PoFx). A POHANDLE value that represents the registration of the device with PoFx. The PEP previously received this handle from PoFx during the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186849">PEP_DPM_REGISTER_DEVICE</a> notification that informed the PEP that the device's driver stack registered the device with PoFx.

## Remarks
The <b>CompleteIdleState</b> member of the <a href="..\pepfx\ns-pepfx-_pep_work_information.md">PEP_WORK_INFORMATION</a> structure is a <b>PEP_WORK_COMPLETE_IDLE_STATE</b> structure.

## Requirements
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows version** | Supported starting with Windows 10. Supported starting with Windows 10. |
| **Header** | pepfx.h (include Pep_x.h) |
