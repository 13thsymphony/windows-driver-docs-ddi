# _PEP_ACPI_ABANDON_DEVICE structure
The <b>PEP_ACPI_ABANDON_DEVICE</b> structure indicates whether the platform extension plug-in (PEP) accepts ownership of an abandoned device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PEP_ACPI_ABANDON_DEVICE {
  PANSI_STRING AcpiDeviceName;
  BOOLEAN      DeviceAccepted;
} PEP_ACPI_ABANDON_DEVICE, *PPEP_ACPI_ABANDON_DEVICE;
````

## Members

        
            `AcpiDeviceName`

            [in] A pointer to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540605">ANSI_STRING</a> structure that contains the fully qualified BIOS name for the device. This name specifies the the path and name of the device in the ACPI namespace. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fe0553df-a5b9-46c4-8e1d-8b89a7d4ad67">Enumerating Child Devices and Control Methods</a>.
        
            `DeviceAccepted`

            [out] Whether the PEP claims ownership of the device specified by the <b>AcpiDeviceName</b> member. Set to TRUE if the PEP claims ownership, and to FALSE if the PEP does not own the device.

    ## Remarks
        This structure is used by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt186657">PEP_NOTIFY_ACPI_ABANDON_DEVICE</a> notification. This notification provides an opportunity for the PEP to clean up any remaining device state after the operating system has abandoned the device. The <b>AcpiDeviceName</b> member of the structure contains an input value that is supplied by the Windows <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/B08F8ABF-FD43-434C-A345-337FBB799D9B">power management framework</a> (PoFx). The <b>DeviceAccepted</b> member contains an output value that the PEP writes to the structure in response to the notification.
