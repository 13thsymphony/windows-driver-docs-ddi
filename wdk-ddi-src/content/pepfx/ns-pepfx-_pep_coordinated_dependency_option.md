# _PEP_COORDINATED_DEPENDENCY_OPTION structure
The <b>PEP_COORIDNATED_DEPENDENCY_OPTION</b> structure describes a coordinated idle stateâ€™s dependency to the OS.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PEP_COORDINATED_DEPENDENCY_OPTION {
  UCHAR   ExpectedStateIndex;
  BOOLEAN LooseDependency;
  BOOLEAN InitiatingState;
  BOOLEAN DependentState;
} PEP_COORDINATED_DEPENDENCY_OPTION, *PPEP_COORDINATED_DEPENDENCY_OPTION;
````

## Members


`DependentState`

Indicates if this state is a valid state for a dependent processor to be in.

`ExpectedStateIndex`

Supplies the index of the idle state (coordinated idle state or processor idle state) that must have already been entered/be entered by this idle transition.

`InitiatingState`

Indicates if the OS may simultaneously enter the state referred to by this dependency.
If <b>FALSE</b>, this state is only valid when another processor has previously entered it.

`LooseDependency`

When <b> FALSE</b>, the OS must use synchronization to guarantee that the state referred to by this dependency has already been entered.
When <b>TRUE</b>,  the OS may perform best-effort coordination that the target state is entered.
The PEP must set <b>LooseDependency</b> to <b>TRUE</b> if the <b>ExpectedState</b> is a processor state and has the <b>WakesSpuriously</b> flag set.
