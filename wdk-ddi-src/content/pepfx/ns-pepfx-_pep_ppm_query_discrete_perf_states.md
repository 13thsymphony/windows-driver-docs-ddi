# _PEP_PPM_QUERY_DISCRETE_PERF_STATES structure
Used in the <b>PEP_NOTIFY_PPM_QUERY_DISCRETE_PERF_STATES</b> notification that stores the list of discrete performance states that PEP supports, if the <b>PEP_NOTIFY_PPM_QUERY_CAPABILITIES</b> notification indicates support for discrete performance states.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PEP_PPM_QUERY_DISCRETE_PERF_STATES {
  ULONG                      Count;
  PPEP_PROCESSOR_PERF_STATE  States;
} PEP_PPM_QUERY_DISCRETE_PERF_STATES, *PPEP_PPM_QUERY_DISCRETE_PERF_STATES;
````

## Members


`Count`

On input, the size of the array pointed to by <i>States</i>.

`States`
