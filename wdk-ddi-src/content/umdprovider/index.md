# Umdprovider.h header



This header is used by Display. For more information, see
- [Display](../_display/index.md)

Umdprovider.h contain these programming interfaces:


## Functions

| Title   | Description   |
| ---- |:---- |
| [UMDEtwLogMapAllocation function](nf-umdprovider-umdetwlogmapallocation.md) | Describes how a Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem (Dxgkrnl.sys) memory allocation, or a portion of the allocation, is being used. |
| [UMDEtwLogUnmapAllocation function](nf-umdprovider-umdetwlogunmapallocation.md) | Indicates that a Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem (Dxgkrnl.sys) memory allocation, or a portion of the allocation, is no longer being used. Call this function whether or not the allocation is being destroyed. |
| [UMDEtwRegister function](nf-umdprovider-umdetwregister.md) | Registers the event trace provider. The driver should call this function before it makes any calls to log events. |
| [UMDEtwUnregister function](nf-umdprovider-umdetwunregister.md) | Unregisters the event trace provider. Call this function before the user-mode driver is unloaded. After this function is called, the driver should not make any other calls to log events. |

## Structures

| Title   | Description   |
| ---- |:---- |
| [_UMDETW_ALLOCATION_USAGE structure](ns-umdprovider-_umdetw_allocation_usage.md) | Indicates the reason for mapping from a Microsoft Direct3D memory allocation to a Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem (Dxgkrnl.sys) allocation. |
