# _CMP_MONITOR_PLUGS structure



## -description
This structure is used to monitor plug access. The request allows a driver to monitor all access to local oPCR and iPCR plugs.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _CMP_MONITOR_PLUGS {
  ULONG                Flags;
  PCMP_MONITOR_ROUTINE pfnNotify;
  PVOID                Context;
} CMP_MONITOR_PLUGS, *PCMP_MONITOR_PLUGS;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Flags

On input, the caller sets this member to REGISTER_MONITOR_PLUG_NOTIFY to register to monitor all local plug access. This member can also be set to DEREGISTER_MONITOR_PLUG_NOTIFY to stop monitoring local plug access.


### -field pfnNotify

On input, aointer to a caller-supplied function to be called by the protocol driver when a local plug is accessed. 

This function uses the following prototype: 

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>typedef void
(*PCMP_MONITOR_ROUTINE) (
  IN PCMP_MONITOR_INFO  MonitorInfo
  );</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>



### -field MonitorInfo

On input, a pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537050">CMP_MONITOR_INFO</a> structure containing the contents of the plug that was modified. 

</dd>
</dl>

### -field Context

On input, a pointer to a caller-defined context for the function at <b>pfnNotify</b>.


## -remarks
If successful, the IEC-61883 protocol driver sets <b>Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status </b>to STATUS_SUCCESS. 

If an incorrect parameter is passed in, the protocol driver sets <b>Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status </b>to STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.
