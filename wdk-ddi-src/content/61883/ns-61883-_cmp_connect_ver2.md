# _CMP_CONNECT_VER2 structure
This structure contains information for a connection request. The  request attempts to make a connection to a plug control register on the local host.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _CMP_CONNECT_VER2 {
  HANDLE               hOutputPlug;
  HANDLE               hInputPlug;
  CMP_CONNECT_TYPE     Type;
  CIP_DATA_FORMAT_VER2 Format;
  HANDLE               hConnect;
} CMP_CONNECT_VER2, *PCMP_CONNECT_VER2;
````

## Members


`Format`

The requested data format.

On input, a pointer to a <a href="..\61883\ns-61883-_cip_data_format_ver2.md">CIP_DATA_FORMAT_VER2</a> structure that specifies the format of the connection.

`hConnect`

On output, the handle for the created connection.

`hInputPlug`

On input, handle to the input plug to use for the connection. If <b>hInputPlug</b> is <b>NULL</b>, the connection is for output only.

`hOutputPlug`

On input, a handle to the output plug to use for the connection. If <b>hOutputPlug</b> is <b>NULL</b>, the connection is for input only.

`Type`

On input, the type of the requested connection.

The type of connection to make. Can be one of the following:





#### CMP_Broadcast

A broadcast connection.  



#### CMP_PointToPoint

A connection between a single output plug and one or more input plugs.

## Remarks
If successful, the IEC-61883 protocol driver sets <b>Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status </b>to STATUS_SUCCESS. 

If an incorrect parameter is passed in, the protocol driver sets <b>Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status </b>to STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.

If the protocol driver is unable to allocate resources, it sets <b>Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status </b>to STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES.
