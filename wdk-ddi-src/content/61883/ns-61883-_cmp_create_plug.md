# _CMP_CREATE_PLUG structure
This structure is used to create a plug. The request creates an input or output plug control register (iPCR or oPCR) on the local host. A driver is responsible for deleting all of the plugs it has created before the system unloads the driver.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _CMP_CREATE_PLUG {
  CMP_PLUG_TYPE       PlugType;
  AV_PCR              Pcr;
  PCMP_NOTIFY_ROUTINE pfnNotify;
  PVOID               Context;
  ULONG               PlugNum;
  HANDLE              hPlug;
} CMP_CREATE_PLUG, *PCMP_CREATE_PLUG;
````

## Members


`Context`

On input, a pointer to an optional caller-supplied context for the function at <b>pfnNotify</b>.

`hPlug`

On output, the handle of the created plug

<b>PlugNum</b>
    
    The plug number of the newly created plug. If the plug could not be created, <b>PlugNum</b> is zero (0). 
    
     <b>hPlug</b>
    
    A handle to the newly created plug. If the plug could not be created, <b>hPlug</b> is null.

.

`Pcr`

On input, an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537010">AV_PCR</a> structure that contains values used by the protocol driver to initialize the plug.

`pfnNotify`

On input, a pointer to a caller-supplied function to be called by the protocol driver when the plug is created.

`PlugNum`

On output, the plug number.

`PlugType`

On input, the type of plug to create. Can be one of the following:





#### CMP_PlugOut

An output plug, which transmits data from the device to the bus.



#### CMP_PlugIn

An input plug, which receives data sent by the bus to the device.

## Remarks
If successful, the IEC-61883 protocol driver sets <b>Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status </b>to STATUS_SUCCESS. 

If an incorrect parameter is passed in, the protocol driver sets <b>Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status </b>to STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.

If the protocol driver is unable to allocate resources, it sets <b>Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status </b>to STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES.
