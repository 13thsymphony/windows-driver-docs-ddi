# _FCP_GET_RESPONSE structure
The structure is used in a request yjsy retrieves the next FCP response from the queue of requests maintained by the IEC-61883 protocol driver. FCP requests and responses from AV devices are routed to the IEC-61883 protocol driver, which queues the requests. Client drivers send <b>Av61883_GetFcpResponse</b> to retrieve an FCP response from the queue.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _FCP_GET_RESPONSE {
  NODE_ADDRESS NodeAddress;
  ULONG        Length;
  PFCP_FRAME   Frame;
} FCP_GET_RESPONSE, *PFCP_GET_RESPONSE;
````

## Members


`Frame`

On input a pointer to a caller-allocated <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537113">FCP_FRAME</a> structure to receive the FCP response.

The FCP frame written to the caller-allocated FCP_FRAME structure by the protocol driver.

`Length`

On input, the maximum available length, in bytes, of the frame payload, including FCP header. 

On completion, this field will contain the actual length of the response in bytes.

`NodeAddress`

On output, if the protocol driver is being used to control a virtual device, the protocol driver supplies the node address of the device that sent the response obtained with this <b>Av61883_GetFcpResponse</b> IRP. If the protocol driver is being used to control a physical device, <b>NodeAddress</b> is not used.

## Remarks
If successful, the IEC-61883 protocol driver sets <b>Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status </b>to STATUS_SUCCESS. 

If the request is queued, the protocol driver sets a status of STATUS_PENDING. If the request has been previously canceled, the driver sets a status of STATUS_CANCELLED.

If an incorrect parameter is passed in, the protocol driver sets <b>Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status </b>to STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.
