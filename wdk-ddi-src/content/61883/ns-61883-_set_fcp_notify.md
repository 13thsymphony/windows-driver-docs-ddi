# _SET_FCP_NOTIFY structure
This structure is used for FCP notification. The SetFcpNotify request registers a client driver notification of FCP requests or responses, or cancels a prior registration. A driver must register for FCP notifications in order to retrieve requests or responses. The driver is responsible for canceling registration by sending an SetFcpNotify request with DEREGISTER_FCP_NOTIFY set in <b>Flags</b> before the system unloads the driver.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _SET_FCP_NOTIFY {
  ULONG        Flags;
  NODE_ADDRESS NodeAddress;
} SET_FCP_NOTIFY, *PSET_FCP_NOTIFY;
````

## Members


`Flags`

On input, specifies the notification requested by the driver. The driver can register by setting <b>Flags</b> with either or both of the following: 

REGISTER_FCP_RESPONSE_NOTIFY

REGISTER_FCP_REQUEST_NOTIFY 

The driver can cancel notification by setting <b>Flags</b> with DEREGISTER_FCP_NOTIFY, which clears REGISTER_FCP_RESPONSE_NOTIFY and REGISTER_FCP_REQUEST_NOTIFY.

`NodeAddress`

Reserved for use by the operating system.

## Remarks
If successful, the IEC-61883 protocol driver sets <b>Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status </b>to STATUS_SUCCESS.
