# _GET_UNIT_CAPABILITIES structure
The GET_UNIT_CAPABILITIES structure is used in conjunction with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536983">Av61883_GetUnitInfo</a> request to retrieve unit information about a device's capabilities.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _GET_UNIT_CAPABILITIES {
  ULONG NumOutputPlugs;
  ULONG NumInputPlugs;
  ULONG MaxDataRate;
  ULONG CTSFlags;
  ULONG HardwareFlags;
} GET_UNIT_CAPABILITIES, *PGET_UNIT_CAPABILITIES;
````

## Members


`CTSFlags`

A bitmask that identifies the command and transaction sets supported by the device. For example, if <b>CTSFlags</b> is 0001, the device supports Audio Video Control (AV/C). If <b>CTSFlags</b> is 4000, the device supports a vendor-unique CTS. Most devices that support multiple command and transaction sets report each CTS value in a separate Configuration ROM unit directory entry, so typically only one bit is set at a time.

`HardwareFlags`

If the AV_HOST_DMA_DOUBLE_BUFFERING_ENABLED flag is set, and the request level is SET_UNIT_INFO_ISOCH_PARAMS, then a size limit is imposed on members <b>RX_NumPackets</b> and <b>TX_NumPackets</b> of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff538921">UNIT_ISOCH_PARAMS</a> structure. These members, when multiplied by the packet size, must be less than or equal to 64 KB. For example, <b>Rx_NumPackets * PacketSize </b>must be less than or equal to 64 KB.

`MaxDataRate`

The maximum data rate of the device. Can be one of the following:

CMP_SPEED_S100

CMP_SPEED_S200

CMP_SPEED_S400

`NumInputPlugs`

The number of input plugs supported by the device.

`NumOutputPlugs`

The number of output plugs supported by the device.
