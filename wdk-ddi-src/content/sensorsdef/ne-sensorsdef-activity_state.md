# ACTIVITY_STATE Enumeration
This enumeration represents the activity states reported by the activity detection sensor.

## Syntax
```
typedef enum ACTIVITY_STATE {
  ActivityState_Unknown      ,
  ActivityState_Stationary   ,
  ActivityState_Fidgeting    ,
  ActivityState_Walking      ,
  ActivityState_Running      ,
  ActivityState_InVehicle    ,
  ActivityState_Biking       ,
  ActivityState_Idle         ,
  ActivityState_Max          ,
  ActivityState_Force_Dword
} ;
```

## Constants

<table>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>ActivityState_Unknown</td>
                    <td>The sensor cannot accurately determine the current activity.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>ActivityState_Stationary</td>
                    <td>Indicates that the sensor is currently stationary.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>ActivityState_Fidgeting</td>
                    <td>Describes the current activity as "fidgeting."</td>
                </tr>

                    <td>ActivityState_Running</td>
                    <td>Describes the current activity as "running."</td>

                    <td>ActivityState_Biking</td>
                    <td>Describes the current activity as "biking."</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>ActivityState_Idle</td>
                    <td>Describes the current activity as "idle."</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>ActivityState_Max</td>
                    <td>Indicates that the current activity state is generating maximum sensor values. In this scenario the sensor doesn't indicate what the activity is.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>ActivityState_Force_Dword</td>
                    <td>Used to force the ACTIVITY_STATE enum to a 32-bit data type (a DWORD).</td>
                </tr>
