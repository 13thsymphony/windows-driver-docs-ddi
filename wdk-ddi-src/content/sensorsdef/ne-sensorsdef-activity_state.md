## -enum-fields

### -field ActivityState_Unknown

The sensor cannot accurately determine the current activity.


### -field ActivityState_Stationary

Indicates that the sensor is currently stationary.


### -field ActivityState_Fidgeting

Describes the current activity as "fidgeting."


### -field ActivityState_Walking

Describes the current activity as "walking."


### -field ActivityState_Running

Describes the current activity as "running."


### -field ActivityState_InVehicle

Describes the current activity as "traveling in a vehicle."


### -field ActivityState_Biking

Describes the current activity as "biking."


### -field ActivityState_Idle

Describes the current activity as "idle."


### -field ActivityState_Max

Indicates that the current activity state is generating maximum sensor values. In this scenario the sensor doesn't indicate what the activity is.


### -field ActivityState_Force_Dword

Used to force the ACTIVITY_STATE enum to a 32-bit data type (a DWORD).
