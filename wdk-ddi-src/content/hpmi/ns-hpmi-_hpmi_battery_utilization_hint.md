<p class="CCE_Message">[Some information relates to pre-released product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.]

This hint indicates if the OEM Battery Manager should attempt to save as
	much charge as possible in the non-hot swappable batteries (i.e. the
	batteries are generally referred to as "internal batteries", these
	batteries cannot be removed while system is operational).

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _HPMI_BATTERY_UTILIZATION_HINT {
  ULONG          Version;
  HPMI_HINT_BOOL PreserveNonHotSwappableBatteries;
} HPMI_BATTERY_UTILIZATION_HINT, *PHPMI_BATTERY_UTILIZATION_HINT;
````

## Members


`PreserveNonHotSwappableBatteries`

Interpretation of values:


    - HpmiBoolUnavailable:
    Battery utilization hint is unavailable at the moment.
    

  - HpmiBoolFalse:
    It is not necessary to preserve charge in the internal batteries
	at the moment.
    

- HpmiBoolTrue:
    Every attempt should be made to save as much charge as possible in
    the internal batteries.

`Version`

Set to HPMI_BATTERY_UTILIZATION_HINT_VERSION_1.
