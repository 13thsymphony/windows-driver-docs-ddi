# GetBuffer method
The <code>GetBuffer</code> method allocates a buffer for long MIDI events.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS GetBuffer(
  [out] PBYTE *ppbBuffer
);
````

## Parameters

`ppBuffer`




## Return Value

<code>GetBuffer</code> returns S_OK if the call was successful. Otherwise, the method returns an appropriate error code.

## Remarks

The miniport driver calls this method only when it needs to send large chunks of data to the capture sink. Specifically, the miniport driver uses this method whenever a component needs to package more data than can be stored in the <b>uData</b> member of <a href="..\dmusicks\ns-dmusicks-_dmus_kernel_event.md">DMUS_KERNEL_EVENT</a>.

The size of the buffer can determined by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536493">IAllocatorMXF::GetBufferSize</a>. <code>GetBufferSize</code> needs to be called only once because the buffer size is constant for any allocator implementation.
