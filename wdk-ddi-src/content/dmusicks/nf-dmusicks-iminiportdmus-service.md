# Service method
This method does not currently need to be implemented in the miniport driver. The<code> Service</code> method is currently unused.

## Syntax

````
VOID Service(
  Â  None
);
````

## Parameters

This function has no parameters.

## Return Value

None

## Remarks

<code>Service</code> was intended to be called during a deferred procedure call (DPC) and was to be executed as the result of a call of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536880">IPortDMus::Notify</a> method. Instead, the DMus port driver sends notification to the miniport driver's input stream by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536791">IMXF::PutMessage</a> with a <b>NULL</b> parameter value. Hence, <code>Service</code> is currently unused.
