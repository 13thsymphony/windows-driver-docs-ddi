# IAllocatorMXF::GetBufferSize method
The <code>GetBufferSize</code> method gets the buffer size from the allocator.

## Syntax

```
USHORT GetBufferSize(

);
```

## Parameters

This function has no parameters.

## Return Value

<code>GetBufferSize</code> returns the size in bytes of the buffer.

## Remarks

<code>GetBufferSize</code> simply returns the size of the buffer that the allocator provides through the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536492">IAllocatorMXF::GetBuffer</a> call. (For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536491">IAllocatorMXF</a> introduction.) Because this is constant for any version of the port driver, <code>GetBufferSize</code> typically needs to be called only once, at the time that the stream is created.
