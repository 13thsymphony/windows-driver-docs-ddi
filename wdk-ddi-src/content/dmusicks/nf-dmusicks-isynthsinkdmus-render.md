# Render method
The <code>Render</code> method renders wave data into a destination sink.

## Syntax

````
void Render(
  [in] PBYTE    pBuffer,
  [in] DWORD    dwLength,
  [in] LONGLONG llPosition
);
````

## Parameters

`pBuffer`

Pointer to the buffer that the synth sink wants data written to

`dwLength`

Specifies the length (in bytes) of the data to be rendered.

`llPosition`

Specifies the position (in bytes) in the PCM buffer at which to begin rendering. Rendering continues from this position for the number of bytes specified in <i>dwLength</i>.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

The port driver's synth-sink object calls this method when the miniport driver needs to render more wave data into the destination buffer.
