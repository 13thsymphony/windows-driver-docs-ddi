# GetMessage method
The <code>GetMessage</code> method serves as the retrieval point for any DirectMusic kernel-mode component that utilizes the port driver's allocator to reuse <a href="..\dmusicks\ns-dmusicks-_dmus_kernel_event.md">DMUS_KERNEL_EVENT</a> structures.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS GetMessage(
  [out] PDMUS_KERNEL_EVENT *ppDMKEvt
);
````

## Parameters

`ppDMKEvt`

Output pointer for the MIDI event. This parameter points to a caller-allocated pointer variable into which the method writes a pointer to the event structure being retrieved from the allocator. The structure itself is empty (zeroed by the allocator).


## Return Value

<code>GetMessage</code> returns S_OK if the call was successful. Otherwise, the method returns an appropriate error code.

## Remarks

The miniport driver uses the <code>GetMessage</code> method to retrieve event structures for MIDI rendering and capture. This method retrieves <a href="..\dmusicks\ns-dmusicks-_dmus_kernel_event.md">DMUS_KERNEL_EVENT</a> structures from the same pool that <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536791">IMXF::PutMessage</a> puts them into when it discards them to the allocator.

In the case of a MIDI capture stream, the port driver retrieves capture events from the miniport driver when prompted by the usual Service DPC.

For more information about the allocator, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/8f263288-2f79-4f1d-b740-d78d40f47b32">Allocator</a>.
