## Members


`BiometricDataFormat`

A structure of type <a href="..\winbio_types\ns-winbio_types-_winbio_registered_format.md">WINBIO_REGISTERED_FORMAT</a> that specifies the data format of the <b>StandardDataBlock</b> for this <a href="..\winbio_types\ns-winbio_types-_winbio_bir.md">WINBIO_BIR</a>.

`CreationDate`

Specifies the creation date and time of this BIR in UTC by using the format YYYYMMDDhhmmss.

`DataFlags`

A structure of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536461">WINBIO_BIR_DATA_FLAGS</a> that specifies the level of processing expected for a data capture.

`DataQuality`

A structure of type WINBIO_BIR_QUALITY that specifies the biometric data quality. Quality measurements are represented as signed integers in the range 0-100, except:

-1  Quality measurements are supported by the BIR creator, but no value is set in the BIR.

-2  Quality measurements are not supported by the BIR creator.

<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>typedef CHAR WINBIO_BIR_QUALITY, *PWINBIO_BIR_QUALITY;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>

`HeaderVersion`

A structure of type WINBIO_BIR_VERSION that specifies the CBEFF header version.

Versions are represented as 8-bit values of the form: 0x<i>NM</i>, where <i>N</i> is the major version and <i>M</i> is the minor version.

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>typedef UCHAR WINBIO_BIR_VERSION, *PWINBIO_BIR_VERSION;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>

`PatronHeaderVersion`

A structure of type WINBIO_BIR_VERSION that specifies PATRON_HEADER_VERSION.

`ProductId`

A structure of type <a href="..\winbio_types\ns-winbio_types-_winbio_registered_format.md">WINBIO_REGISTERED_FORMAT</a> that specifies the product identifier for the component that generated the <b>StandardDataBlock</b> for this WINBIO_BIR.

`Purpose`

A structure of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536463">WINBIO_BIR_PURPOSE</a> that specifies the intended use of the data.

`Subtype`

A structure of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536457">WINBIO_BIOMETRIC_SENSOR_SUBTYPE</a> that specifies the biometric subtype.

`Type`

A structure of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536458">WINBIO_BIOMETRIC_TYPE</a> that specifies the biometric type.

`ValidFields`

A Patron Format A bitmask that indicates which CBEFF optional fields are present in the BIR. For more information about all members of WINBIO_BIR_HEADER, follow the link in the Remarks section to the <i>NISTIR 6529-A Specification</i>.

`ValidityPeriod`

Specifies the validity period of this BIR by using the format described in <i>CreationDate</i>.

## Remarks
You can find more information about the fields of the standard biometric header in the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=133328">NISTIR 6529-A Specification</a>.
