# _WINBIO_BIR structure
The WINBIO_BIR structure is the root of the BIR (Biometric Information Record). It contains the size and offset of any other data elements in the BIR.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _WINBIO_BIR {
  WINBIO_BIR_DATA HeaderBlock;
  WINBIO_BIR_DATA StandardDataBlock;
  WINBIO_BIR_DATA VendorDataBlock;
  WINBIO_BIR_DATA SignatureBlock;
} WINBIO_BIR, *PWINBIO_BIR;
````

## Members


`HeaderBlock`

A structure of type <a href="..\winbio_types\ns-winbio_types-_winbio_bir_data.md">WINBIO_BIR_DATA</a> that contains size and offset information for a standard biometric header. This member is required.

`SignatureBlock`

A structure of type <a href="..\winbio_types\ns-winbio_types-_winbio_bir_data.md">WINBIO_BIR_DATA</a> that contains size and offset information for a signature block. This member is optional. Set this member to 0,0 if you do not use it.

`StandardDataBlock`

A structure of type <a href="..\winbio_types\ns-winbio_types-_winbio_bir_data.md">WINBIO_BIR_DATA</a> that contains size and offset information for a standard data block based on the ANSI 381 format. This member is optional. Set this member to 0,0 if you do not use it.

`VendorDataBlock`

A structure of type <a href="..\winbio_types\ns-winbio_types-_winbio_bir_data.md">WINBIO_BIR_DATA</a> that contains size and offset information for a vendor-specific data block.  This member is optional. Set this member to 0,0 if you do not use it.

## Remarks
The four WINBIO_BIR_DATA structures are contiguous and should be immediately followed by the actual data for each block.  Thus, the offset for the <i>HeaderBlock</i> will always be 4*(sizeof (WINBIO_BIR_DATA).  You can use the <a href="..\winbio_types\ns-winbio_types-_winbio_bir_header.md">WINBIO_BIR_HEADER</a> structure to provide the actual data of the header block.  

The offset of where the <i>StandardDataBlock</i> starts should be the offset of the HeaderBlock plus the size of the HeaderBlock.
