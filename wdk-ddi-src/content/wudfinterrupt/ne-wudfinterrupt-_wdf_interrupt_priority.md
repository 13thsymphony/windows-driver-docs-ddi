# _WDF_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY enumeration



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]


      The <a href="..\wudfinterrupt\ne-wudfinterrupt-_wdf_interrupt_priority.md">WDF_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY</a> enumeration type identifies relative priorities for device interrupts.



## -syntax

````
typedef enum _WDF_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY { 
  WdfIrqPriorityUndefined  = 0,
  WdfIrqPriorityLow        = 1,
  WdfIrqPriorityNormal     = 2,
  WdfIrqPriorityHigh       = 3
} WDF_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY, *PWDF_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY;
````


## -enum-fields

### -field WdfIrqPriorityUndefined

The relative priority of a device's interrupt is undefined.


### -field WdfIrqPriorityLow

The device's interrupt has a relatively low priority, typically because the interrupt does not have to be serviced immediately.


### -field WdfIrqPriorityNormal

The device's interrupt priority is neither relatively low nor relatively high.


### -field WdfIrqPriorityHigh

The device's interrupt has a relatively high priority, typically because the interrupt must be serviced immediately.


## -remarks
The <a href="..\wudfinterrupt\ne-wudfinterrupt-_wdf_interrupt_priority.md">WDF_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY</a> enumeration type is used as input to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/EDBCBB37-41A4-4234-BE8C-4C8739BC287B">IWDFInterrupt::SetPolicy</a> method.
