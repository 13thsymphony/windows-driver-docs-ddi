# KsNotifyError method
The <b>KsNotifyError</b> method notifies the filter graph of an error to give the filter graph an opportunity to halt.

## Syntax

````
VOID KsNotifyError(
  [in] IMediaSample *Sample,
  [in] HRESULT      hr
);
````

## Parameters

`Sample`

Pointer to the <b>IMediaSample</b> interface for the associated media sample.

`hr`

Error value for notification. If ERROR_OPERATION_ABORTED (that is, the I/O was purposefully canceled), the filter graph is not notified.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

The <b>KsNotifyError</b> method notifies the filter graph of the specific error using the EC_ERRORABORT event, which specifies that the error forced the termination of an I/O operation.

For more information about <b>IMediaSample</b>, see the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.
