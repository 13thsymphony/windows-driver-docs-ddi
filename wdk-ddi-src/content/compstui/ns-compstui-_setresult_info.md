# _SETRESULT_INFO structure
The SETRESULT_INFO structure is used as an input parameter to an application's <a href="..\compstui\nc-compstui-pfnpropsheetui.md">PFNPROPSHEETUI</a>-typed callback function.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _SETRESULT_INFO {
  WORD    cbSize;
  WORD    wReserved;
  HANDLE  hSetResult;
  LRESULT Result;
} SETRESULT_INFO, *PSETRESULT_INFO;
````

## Members


`cbSize`

CPSUI-supplied size, in bytes, of the SETRESULT_INFO structure.

`hSetResult`

CPSUI-supplied handle to an added property sheet page, obtained from the application. For more information, see the following Remarks section.

`Result`

CPSUI-supplied handle to an added property sheet page, obtained from the application. For more information, see the following Remarks section.

`wReserved`

Reserved.

## Remarks
When an application calls CPSUI's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546207">ComPropSheet</a> function, specifying a function code of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547087">CPSFUNC_SET_RESULT</a>, CPSUI calls all registered <a href="..\compstui\nc-compstui-pfnpropsheetui.md">PFNPROPSHEETUI</a>-typed functions, specifying a reason of PROPSHEETUI_REASON_SET_RESULT. When specifying this reason, CPSUI also supplies a SETRESULT_INFO structure.

The values contained in the structure's <b>hSetResult</b> and <b>Result</b> members are the <i>lParam1</i> and <i>lParam2</i> values, respectively, that were supplied to CPSUI's <b>ComPropSheet</b> function.

Each of the application's PFNPROPSHEETUI-typed functions is called in order, from the one most recently declared to the first one declared, until one of these functions provides a return value of less than one. At that point, CPSUI returns from its <b>ComPropSheet</b> function, providing a count of the number of PFNPROPSHEETUI-typed functions that were called.

Typically, an application's PFNPROPSHEETUI-typed function sets the <b>Result</b> member of its PROPSHEETUI_INFO structure to the value received in the SETRESULT_INFO structure's <b>Result</b> member. Then the function returns a value of 1 (or greater), so the next PFNPROPSHEETUI-typed function can also receive it. Each subsequently called function is associated with a page that is the parent of the page associated with the last-called function. A function can modify the contents of SETRESULT_INFO structure's <b>Result</b> member, causing the functions associated with parent pages to receive the new value.
