# _STREAM_INFO structure
This structure stores information about a stream associated with a bulk endpoint.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct _STREAM_INFO {
  ULONG    Size;
  WDFQUEUE WdfQueue;
  ULONG    StreamId;
} STREAM_INFO, *PSTREAM_INFO;
```

## Members


`Size`

The size in bytes of this structure.

`WdfQueue`

A handle to the framework queue object that contains streams.

`StreamId`

The stream identifier. The open-static streams request obtains stream identifiers that are assigned by the USB driver stack.
