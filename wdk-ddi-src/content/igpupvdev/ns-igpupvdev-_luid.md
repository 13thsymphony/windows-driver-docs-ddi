# _LUID structure



## -description
The locally unique identifier (LUID) is a 64-bit value guaranteed to be unique only on the system on
  which it was generated. The uniqueness of an LUID is guaranteed only until the system is restarted. 
  

An LUID is not for direct manipulation. Drivers must use support routines and structures to manipulate
  LUID values.
