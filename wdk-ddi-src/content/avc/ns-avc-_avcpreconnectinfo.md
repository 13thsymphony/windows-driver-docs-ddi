# _AVCPRECONNECTINFO structure
The AVCPRECONNECTINFO structure is used to initialize a subunit driver and establish pin connections.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _AVCPRECONNECTINFO {
  GUID           DeviceID;
  UCHAR          SubunitAddress[AVCCONNECTINFO_MAX_SUBUNITADDR_LEN];
  ULONG          SubunitPlugNumber;
  KSPIN_DATAFLOW DataFlow;
  ULONG          Flags;
  ULONG          UnitPlugNumber;
} AVCPRECONNECTINFO, *PAVCPRECONNECTINFO;
````

## Members


`DataFlow`

The direction of data flow on this subunit plug. Destination plugs have KSPIN_DATAFLOW_IN; source plugs have KSPIN_DATAFLOW_OUT.

`DeviceID`

A GUID representing the unit as a whole. All subunits within the same unit share the same GUID. No two units share the same GUID.

`Flags`

A bitmap with one or more bits set from the KSPIN_FLAG_AVC enumeration.

`SubunitAddress`

The encoded subunit type and subunit ID of the subunit.

`SubunitPlugNumber`

The plug number (within the subunit) described by the AVCPRECONNECTINFO structure.

`UnitPlugNumber`

The plug number (within the subunit) described by the AVCPRECONNECTINFO structure.

## Remarks
This structure is used with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554154">AVC_FUNCTION_GET_CONNECTINFO</a> function code.

This structure is used only as member of the AVC_PRECONNECT_INFO structure. It is not used by itself.
