# _AVC_SETCONNECT_INFO structure
The AVC_SETCONNECT_INFO structure is used to initialize a subunit driver and establish pin connections.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _AVC_SETCONNECT_INFO {
  ULONG          PinId;
  AVCCONNECTINFO ConnectInfo;
} AVC_SETCONNECT_INFO, *PAVC_SETCONNECT_INFO;
````

## Members


`ConnectInfo`

The AVCCONNECTINFO values for the specified pin.

`PinId`

Specifies the offset (or ID) of the pin for which information is to be set.

## Remarks
This structure is used with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554171">AVC_FUNCTION_SET_CONNECTINFO</a> function code.

This structure is used only as a member inside the AVC_MULTIFUNC_IRB structure. It is not used by itself.

See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3b4ec139-ff01-40bd-8e29-92f554180585">How to Use Avc.sys</a> For information about building and sending an AV/C command.
