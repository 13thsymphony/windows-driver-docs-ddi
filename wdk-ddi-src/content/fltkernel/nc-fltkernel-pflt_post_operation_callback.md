# PFLT_POST_OPERATION_CALLBACK callback function
A minifilter driver can register one or more routines of type PFLT_POST_OPERATION_CALLBACK to perform completion processing for I/O operations.

## Syntax

```
PFLT_POST_OPERATION_CALLBACK PfltPostOperationCallback;

FLT_POSTOP_CALLBACK_STATUS PfltPostOperationCallback(
  PFLT_CALLBACK_DATA Data,
  PCFLT_RELATED_OBJECTS FltObjects,
  PVOID CompletionContext,
  FLT_POST_OPERATION_FLAGS Flags
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Data`

A pointer to the callback data (<a href="..\fltkernel\ns-fltkernel-_flt_callback_data.md">FLT_CALLBACK_DATA</a>) structure for the I/O operation.

`FltObjects`

A pointer to a filter manager maintained <a href="..\fltkernel\ns-fltkernel-_flt_related_objects.md">FLT_RELATED_OBJECTS</a> structure that contains opaque pointers for the objects related to the current I/O request.

`CompletionContext`

A context pointer that was returned by the minifilter driver's pre-operation callback (<a href="..\fltkernel\nc-fltkernel-pflt_pre_operation_callback.md">PFLT_PRE_OPERATION_CALLBACK</a>) routine.  The <i>CompletionContext</i> pointer provides a way to communicate information from the pre-operation callback routine to the post-operation callback routine.

`Flags`

A bitmask of flags that specifies how the post-operation callback is to be performed. 

<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
FLTFL_POST_OPERATION_DRAINING

</td>
<td>
The filter manager sets this flag to indicate that the minifilter driver instance is being detached and that this post-operation callback routine is being called to clean up the minifilter driver's completion context. The post-operation callback should return FLT_POSTOP_FINISHED_PROCESSING. If this flag is set, the <i>Data</i> parameter points to a copy of the original callback data structure for the operation, not the original callback data structure. Additionally, when this flag is set, the post-operation callback routine is called at IRQL &lt;= APC_LEVEL.

</td>
</tr>
</table>


## Return Value

This callback routine returns one of the following status values: 

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>FLT_POSTOP_FINISHED_PROCESSING</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The minifilter driver has finished completion processing for the I/O operation and is returning control of the operation to the filter manager. 

After the post-operation callback returns this status value, the filter manager continues completion processing of the I/O operation. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>FLT_POSTOP_MORE_PROCESSING_REQUIRED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The minifilter driver has halted completion processing for the I/O operation, but it is not returning control of the operation to the filter manager. 

A minifilter driver's post-operation callback can return this status value only if the minifilter driver's post-operation callback has posted the I/O operation to a work queue. The minifilter driver must eventually resume completion processing of the I/O operation. 

After the post-operation callback returns FLT_POSTOP_MORE_PROCESSING_REQUIRED, the filter manager performs no further completion processing of the I/O operation, unless both of the following conditions are true: 

<ul>
<li>
The post-operation callback has posted the I/O operation to a work queue. 

</li>
<li>
After the work routine performs completion processing for the operation, it calls <a href="..\fltkernel\nf-fltkernel-fltcompletependedpostoperation.md">FltCompletePendedPostOperation</a> to return control of the operation to the filter manager. 

</li>
</ul>
This status value can only be returned for IRP-based I/O operations. To determine whether a given callback data structure represents an IRP-based I/O operation, use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544654">FLT_IS_IRP_OPERATION</a> macro. 

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

A minifilter driver's post-operation callback routine performs completion processing for one or more types of I/O operations. 

Post-operation callback routines are similar to the completion routines used by legacy file system filter drivers. 

Post-operation callback routines are called in an arbitrary thread context, at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL. 

Because this callback routine can be called at IRQL DISPATCH_LEVEL, it is subject to the following constraints: 

<ul>
<li>
It cannot safely call any kernel-mode routine that must run at a lower IRQL. 

</li>
<li>
Any data structures used in this routine must be allocated from nonpaged pool. 

</li>
<li>
It cannot be made pageable. 

</li>
<li>
It cannot acquire resources, mutexes, or fast mutexes. However, it can acquire spin locks. 

</li>
<li>
It cannot get, set, or delete contexts, but it can release contexts. 

</li>
</ul>
Any I/O completion processing that needs to be performed at IRQL &lt; DISPATCH_LEVEL cannot be performed directly in the postoperation callback routine. Instead, it must be posted to a work queue by calling a routine such as <a href="..\fltkernel\nf-fltkernel-fltdocompletionprocessingwhensafe.md">FltDoCompletionProcessingWhenSafe</a> or <a href="..\fltkernel\nf-fltkernel-fltqueuedeferredioworkitem.md">FltQueueDeferredIoWorkItem</a>. 

Be aware that <b>FltDoCompletionProcessingWhenSafe</b> should never be called if the <i>Flags</i> parameter of the post-operation callback has the FLTFL_POST_OPERATION_DRAINING bit set.  The following are exceptions to this rule: 

<ul>
<li>
If a minifilter driver's pre-operation callback routine returns FLT_PREOP_SYNCHRONIZE for an IRP-based I/O operation, the corresponding post-operation callback routine is guaranteed to be called at IRQL &lt;= APC_LEVEL, in the same thread context as the pre-operation callback. 

</li>
<li>
Post-create callback routines are guaranteed to be called at IRQL PASSIVE_LEVEL, in the context of the thread that originated the IRP_MJ_CREATE operation. 

</li>
</ul>
A minifilter driver registers a post-operation callback routine for a particular type of I/O operation by storing the callback routine's entry point in the <b>OperationRegistration</b> array of the <a href="..\fltkernel\ns-fltkernel-_flt_registration.md">FLT_REGISTRATION</a> structure.  The minifilter driver passes this structure as a parameter to <a href="..\fltkernel\nf-fltkernel-fltregisterfilter.md">FltRegisterFilter</a> in its <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-driver_initialize.md">DriverEntry</a> routine. 

A minifilter driver can register a post-operation callback routine for a particular type of I/O operation without registering a pre-operation callback (<a href="..\fltkernel\nc-fltkernel-pflt_pre_operation_callback.md">PFLT_PRE_OPERATION_CALLBACK</a>) routine, and vice versa.
