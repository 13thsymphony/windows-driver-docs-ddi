# FltAcknowledgeEcp function
The <b>FltAcknowledgeEcp</b> routine is used to mark an extra create parameter context structure (ECP) as acknowledged.

## Syntax

````
VOID FltAcknowledgeEcp(
  _In_ PFLT_FILTER Filter,
  _In_ PVOID       EcpContext
);
````

## Parameters

`Filter`

Opaque filter pointer for the minifilter driver. This pointer uniquely identifies the minifilter driver and remains constant as long as the minifilter driver is loaded.

`EcpContext`

Pointer to the ECP to mark as acknowledged.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

This routine is available in Windows Vista and later. 

The ECP pointed to by the <i>EcpContext</i> parameter is marked as "acknowledged" by this routine.  This acknowledgment could indicate a number of things, including whether the ECP has been looked at, used, processed, and so on.  Note that the <a href="..\fltkernel\nf-fltkernel-fltisecpacknowledged.md">FltIsEcpAcknowledged</a> routine can be used to determine if a particular ECP has been marked as acknowledged.
