# PFLT_INSTANCE_SETUP_CALLBACK callback function
A minifilter driver can register a routine of type PFLT_INSTANCE_SETUP_CALLBACK as the minifilter driver's <i>InstanceSetupCallback</i> routine.

## Syntax

```
PFLT_INSTANCE_SETUP_CALLBACK PfltInstanceSetupCallback;

NTSTATUS PfltInstanceSetupCallback(
  PCFLT_RELATED_OBJECTS FltObjects,
  FLT_INSTANCE_SETUP_FLAGS Flags,
  DEVICE_TYPE VolumeDeviceType,
  FLT_FILESYSTEM_TYPE VolumeFilesystemType
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`FltObjects`

Pointer to an <a href="..\fltkernel\ns-fltkernel-_flt_related_objects.md">FLT_RELATED_OBJECTS</a> structure that contains opaque pointers for the objects related to the current operation.

`Flags`

Bitmask of flags that indicate why the instance is being attached. One or more of the following: 

<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
FLTFL_INSTANCE_SETUP_AUTOMATIC_ATTACHMENT

</td>
<td>
The instance is being attached automatically. Either the minifilter driver was just loaded and is being attached to all existing volumes, or it is being attached to a newly mounted volume. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
FLTFL_INSTANCE_SETUP_MANUAL_ATTACHMENT

</td>
<td>
The instance is being attached manually because a user-mode application has called <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540442">FilterAttach</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540448">FilterAttachAtAltitude</a> or because a kernel-mode component has called <a href="..\fltkernel\nf-fltkernel-fltattachvolume.md">FltAttachVolume</a> or <a href="..\fltkernel\nf-fltkernel-fltattachvolumeataltitude.md">FltAttachVolumeAtAltitude</a>. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
FLTFL_INSTANCE_SETUP_NEWLY_MOUNTED_VOLUME

</td>
<td>
The instance is being attached automatically to a newly mounted volume. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
FLTFL_INSTANCE_SETUP_DETACHED_VOLUME

</td>
<td>
The instance is being attached to a detached volume. It is possible, on some filesystems (such as FAT and CDFS), to reattach a volume after it has detached. A volume is detached if it has no associated storage stack. A volume in this state is usually a dismounted volume that still has open files.  

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`VolumeDeviceType`

Device type of the file system volume. Must be one of the following: 

FILE_DEVICE_CD_ROM_FILE_SYSTEM

FILE_DEVICE_DISK_FILE_SYSTEM

FILE_DEVICE_NETWORK_FILE_SYSTEM

`VolumeFilesystemType`

File system type of the volume.   The possible values are listed in <a href="..\fltuserstructures\ne-fltuserstructures-_flt_filesystem_type.md">FLT_FILESYSTEM_TYPE</a>.


## Return Value

This callback routine returns STATUS_SUCCESS or an NTSTATUS value such as the following: 

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_FLT_DO_NOT_ATTACH</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Returning this value prevents the minifilter driver instance from being attached to the given volume. This is an error code. 

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>   Do not perform any thread synchronization or inter-process communication in the PFLT_INSTANCE_SETUP_CALLBACK implementation. Performing such operations can lead to deadlock conditions. </div>
<div> </div>
When a minifilter driver registers itself by calling <a href="..\fltkernel\nf-fltkernel-fltregisterfilter.md">FltRegisterFilter</a> from its <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-driver_initialize.md">DriverEntry</a> routine, it can register a routine of type PFLT_INSTANCE_SETUP_CALLBACK as the minifilter driver's <i>InstanceSetupCallback</i> routine. 

To register the<i> InstanceSetupCallback</i> routine, the minifilter driver stores the address of a routine of type PFLT_INSTANCE_SETUP_CALLBACK in the <b>InstanceSetupCallback</b> member of the <a href="..\fltkernel\ns-fltkernel-_flt_registration.md">FLT_REGISTRATION</a> structure that the minifilter driver passes as the <i>Registration</i> parameter of <b>FltRegisterFilter</b>. 

The filter manager calls this routine on the first operation after a new volume is mounted. 

The filter manager calls this routine to allow the minifilter driver to respond to an automatic or manual attachment request. If this routine returns an error or warning NTSTATUS code, the minifilter driver instance is not attached to the given volume. Otherwise, the minifilter driver instance is attached to the given volume.
