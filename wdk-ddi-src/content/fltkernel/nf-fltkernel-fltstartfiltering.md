# FltStartFiltering function
<b>FltStartFiltering</b> starts filtering for a registered minifilter driver.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS FltStartFiltering(
  _In_ PFLT_FILTER Filter
);
````

## Parameters

`Filter`

Opaque filter pointer returned by <a href="..\fltkernel\nf-fltkernel-fltregisterfilter.md">FltRegisterFilter</a>.


## Return Value

<b>FltStartFiltering</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS or an appropriate NTSTATUS value such as the following: 

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Filtering was already started for this minifilter driver. This is an error code. 

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

A minifilter driver typically calls <b>FltStartFiltering</b> from its <b>DriverEntry</b> routine after it has completed its global initialization and called <a href="..\fltkernel\nf-fltkernel-fltregisterfilter.md">FltRegisterFilter</a>. <b>FltStartFiltering</b> notifies the Filter Manager that the minifilter driver is ready to begin attaching to volumes and filtering I/O requests. After the minifilter driver calls this routine, the Filter Manager treats the minifilter driver as a fully active minifilter driver, presenting it with volumes to attach to, as well as I/O requests. The minifilter driver must be prepared to begin receiving these notifications and I/O requests even before <b>FltStartFiltering</b> returns.
