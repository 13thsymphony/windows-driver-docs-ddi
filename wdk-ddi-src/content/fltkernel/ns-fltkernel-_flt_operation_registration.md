# _FLT_OPERATION_REGISTRATION structure
The FLT_OPERATION_REGISTRATION structure is used to register operation callback routines.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _FLT_OPERATION_REGISTRATION {
  UCHAR                            MajorFunction;
  FLT_OPERATION_REGISTRATION_FLAGS Flags;
  PFLT_PRE_OPERATION_CALLBACK      PreOperation;
  PFLT_POST_OPERATION_CALLBACK     PostOperation;
  PVOID                            Reserved1;
} FLT_OPERATION_REGISTRATION, *PFLT_OPERATION_REGISTRATION;
````

## Members


`Flags`

Bitmask of flags specifying when to call the preoperation (<a href="..\fltkernel\nc-fltkernel-pflt_pre_operation_callback.md">PFLT_PRE_OPERATION_CALLBACK</a>) and postoperation (<a href="..\fltkernel\nc-fltkernel-pflt_post_operation_callback.md">PFLT_POST_OPERATION_CALLBACK</a>) callback routines for cached I/O or paging I/O operations. This member is optional and can be zero. 
<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
FLTFL_OPERATION_REGISTRATION_SKIP_CACHED_IO

</td>
<td>
A minifilter sets this flag for read or write operations to specify that its preoperation and postoperation callback routines should not be called for cached I/O operations. This flag applies to fast I/O as well as IRP-based reads and writes because all fast I/O is cached. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
FLTFL_OPERATION_REGISTRATION_SKIP_PAGING_IO

</td>
<td>
A minifilter sets this flag for read or write operations to specify that its preoperation and postoperation callback routines should not be called for paging I/O operations. This flag applies only to IRP-based I/O operations. It is ignored for I/O operations that are not IRP-based. 

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`MajorFunction`

Major function code specifying the type of I/O operation. This member is required and cannot be <b>NULL</b>. For more information about additional operations, see <a href="..\fltkernel\ns-fltkernel-_flt_parameters.md">FLT_PARAMETERS</a>.

`PostOperation`

Pointer to a <a href="..\fltkernel\nc-fltkernel-pflt_post_operation_callback.md">PFLT_POST_OPERATION_CALLBACK</a>-typed routine to be registered as the postoperation callback routine for this type of I/O operation. This member is optional and can be <b>NULL</b>.

`PreOperation`

Pointer to a <a href="..\fltkernel\nc-fltkernel-pflt_pre_operation_callback.md">PFLT_PRE_OPERATION_CALLBACK</a>-typed routine to be registered as the preoperation callback routine for this type of I/O operation. This member is optional and can be <b>NULL</b>.

`Reserved1`

Reserved for system use. Minifilters must set this member to <b>NULL</b>.

## Remarks
When a minifilter calls <a href="..\fltkernel\nf-fltkernel-fltregisterfilter.md">FltRegisterFilter</a> from its <b>DriverEntry</b> routine, it can register a preoperation callback (<a href="..\fltkernel\nc-fltkernel-pflt_pre_operation_callback.md">PFLT_PRE_OPERATION_CALLBACK</a>) routine and a postoperation callback (<a href="..\fltkernel\nc-fltkernel-pflt_post_operation_callback.md">PFLT_POST_OPERATION_CALLBACK</a>) routine for each type of I/O operation that it must handle. 

To register these callback routines, the minifilter creates a variable-length array of FLT_OPERATION_REGISTRATION structures and stores a pointer to the array in the <b>OperationRegistration</b> member of the <a href="..\fltkernel\ns-fltkernel-_flt_registration.md">FLT_REGISTRATION</a> structure that the minifilter passes as the <i>Registration</i> parameter of <a href="..\fltkernel\nf-fltkernel-fltregisterfilter.md">FltRegisterFilter</a>. The last element of this array must be {IRP_MJ_OPERATION_END}. 

The minifilter must create a separate FLT_OPERATION_REGISTRATION structure for each type of I/O operation that it handles. In this structure, the minifilter specifies the entry points of its callback routines in the structure's <b>PreOperation</b> and <b>PostOperation</b> members. 

A minifilter can register a preoperation callback routine for a given type of I/O operation without registering a postoperation callback and vice versa. 

File systems do not receive IRP_MJ_POWER or IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CHANGE requests. Minifilters cannot register preoperation or postoperation callback routines for these operations. 

A minifilter cannot register a postoperation callback routine for IRP_MJ_SHUTDOWN. 

A single preoperation or postoperation callback routine can be used to process more than one type of I/O operation. However, the callback routine must be registered separately for each type of I/O operation.
