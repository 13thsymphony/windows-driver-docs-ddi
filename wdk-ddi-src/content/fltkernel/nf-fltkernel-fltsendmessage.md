# FltSendMessage function



## -description
<b>FltSendMessage</b> sends a message to a waiting user-mode application on behalf of a minifilter driver or a minifilter driver instance. 



## -syntax

````
NTSTATUS FltSendMessage(
  _In_      PFLT_FILTER    Filter,
  _In_      PFLT_PORT      *ClientPort,
  _In_      PVOID          SenderBuffer,
  _In_      ULONG          SenderBufferLength,
  _Out_opt_ PVOID          ReplyBuffer,
  _Inout_   PULONG         ReplyLength,
  _In_opt_  PLARGE_INTEGER Timeout
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Filter [in]

Opaque filter pointer for the caller. This parameter is required and cannot be <b>NULL</b>. 


### -param ClientPort [in]

A pointer to a variable that contains the opaque client port pointer for the connection port between the user-mode application and the kernel-mode minifilter driver. For more information about the client port pointer, see the description of the <i>ConnectNotifyCallback</i> parameter in the reference entry for <a href="..\fltkernel\nf-fltkernel-fltcreatecommunicationport.md">FltCreateCommunicationPort</a>. 


### -param SenderBuffer [in]

A pointer to a caller-allocated buffer containing the message to be sent to the user-mode application. This parameter is required and cannot be <b>NULL</b>. 


### -param SenderBufferLength [in]

Size, in bytes, of the buffer that <i>SenderBuffer </i>points to. See Remarks.


### -param ReplyBuffer [out, optional]

A pointer to a caller-allocated buffer that receives the reply (if any) from the application. This parameter is optional and can be <b>NULL</b>. 


### -param ReplyLength [in, out]

Size, in bytes, of the buffer that <i>ReplyBuffer </i>points to. 


### -param Timeout [in, optional]

A pointer to a timeout value that specifies the total absolute or relative length of time, in units of 100 nanoseconds, for which the caller can be put into a wait state until the message is received by the user-mode application and until it receives a reply (if one is expected). Set to <b>NULL</b> if the caller can be put into a wait state indefinitely. 


## -returns
<b>FltSendMessage</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS or an appropriate NTSTATUS value such as one of the following: 
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES</b></dt>
</dl><b>FltSendMessage</b> encountered a pool allocation failure. This is an error code. 
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_PORT_DISCONNECTED</b></dt>
</dl>The communication port has been disconnected. This is an error code. 
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_TIMEOUT</b></dt>
</dl>The <i>Timeout</i> interval expired before the message could be delivered or before a reply was received. This is a success code. 

 


## -remarks
<b>FltSendMessage</b> sends a message to a user-mode application on behalf of a minifilter driver or a minifilter driver instance. 

If the application calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540506">FilterGetMessage</a> to get the message before the minifilter driver calls <b>FltSendMessage</b> to send it, the message is delivered immediately. (This is typically the case when the application calls <b>FilterGetMessage</b> from inside a message loop.) 

Otherwise, if <i>Timeout</i> is nonzero, the minifilter driver is put into a wait state as follows: 

If the application calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540506">FilterGetMessage</a> before the <i>Timeout</i> interval expires, the message is delivered. 

Otherwise, the message is not delivered, and <b>FltSendMessage</b> returns STATUS_TIMEOUT. (Note: STATUS_TIMEOUT is a success code.) 

If <i>Timeout</i> is zero when the message is being sent, the minifilter driver is put into a wait state indefinitely. When the application calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540506">FilterGetMessage</a>, the message is delivered. 

After the message is delivered, if <i>ReplyBuffer</i> is <b>NULL</b>, <b>FltSendMessage</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS. 

If the application calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541508">FilterReplyMessage</a> before the <i>Timeout</i> interval expires, the minifilter driver receives the reply, and <b>FltSendMessage</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS. 

Otherwise, the minifilter driver does not receive a reply, and <b>FltSendMessage</b> returns STATUS_TIMEOUT. (Note: STATUS_TIMEOUT is a success code.) 

If <i>Timeout</i> is zero when the minifilter driver is waiting for the reply, the minifilter driver is put into a wait state indefinitely. When the application calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541508">FilterReplyMessage</a>, the minifilter driver receives the reply, and <b>FltSendMessage</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS.
<p class="note">Given this structure, it might seem obvious that the caller of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541508">FilterReplyMessage</a> would set the <i>dwReplyBufferSize</i> parameter to <b>sizeof(REPLY_STRUCT)</b> and the <i>ReplyLength</i> parameter of <b>FltSendMessage</b> to the same value.  However, because of structure padding idiosyncrasies, <b>sizeof(REPLY_STRUCT)</b> might be larger than <b>sizeof(FILTER_REPLY_HEADER) + sizeof(MY_STRUCT)</b>.  If this is the case, <b>FltSendMessage</b> returns STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW.
<p class="note">Therefore, we recommend that you call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541508">FilterReplyMessage</a> and <b>FltSendMessage</b> (leveraging the above example) by setting <i>dwReplyBufferSize</i> and <i>ReplyLength</i> both to s<b>izeof(FILTER_REPLY_HEADER) + sizeof(MY_STRUCT)</b> instead of <b>sizeof(REPLY_STRUCT)</b>. This ensures that any extra padding at the end of the REPLY_STRUCT structure is ignored.
