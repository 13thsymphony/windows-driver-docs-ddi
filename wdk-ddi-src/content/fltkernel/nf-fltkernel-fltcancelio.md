# FltCancelIo function
The <b>FltCancelIo</b> routine cancels an I/O operation.

## Syntax

````
BOOLEAN FltCancelIo(
  _In_ PFLT_CALLBACK_DATA CallbackData
);
````

## Parameters

`CallbackData`

Pointer to the callback data (<a href="..\fltkernel\ns-fltkernel-_flt_callback_data.md">FLT_CALLBACK_DATA</a>) structure for the I/O operation.


## Return Value

<b>FltCancelIo</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the I/O operation was canceled successfully. Otherwise, it returns <b>FALSE</b>.

## Remarks

A minifilter driver that initiates an I/O operation by calling a routine such as <a href="..\fltkernel\nf-fltkernel-fltperformasynchronousio.md">FltPerformAsynchronousIo</a> can cancel the operation by calling <b>FltCancelIo</b>. The operation must be an IRP-based I/O operation, it must not be currently posted to the minifilter driver's own work queue, and it must not have been completed. 

If the IRP has a cancel routine, <b>FltCancelIo</b> sets the IRP's cancel bit and calls the cancel routine. 

If the IRP does not have a cancel routine, and therefore the IRP is not cancelable, <b>FltCancelIo</b> sets the IRP's cancel bit and returns <b>FALSE</b>. The IRP should be canceled at a later time when it becomes cancelable. 

If a minifilter driver that did not initiate the IRP-based I/O operation calls <b>FltCancelIo</b>, the results are unpredictable. For example, the IRP might be completed with a success NTSTATUS code even though its cancel bit was set. 

<b>FltCancelIo</b> returns <b>FALSE</b> if any of the following conditions are true: 
<ul>
<li>
The operation is not an IRP-based I/O operation. 

</li>
<li>
No cancel routine is specified for the I/O operation. 

</li>
<li>
The I/O operation has already been canceled. 

</li>
</ul>To determine whether a given callback data structure represents an IRP-based I/O operation, use the FLT_IS_IRP_OPERATION macro. 

To specify a cancel routine for an I/O operation, call <a href="..\fltkernel\nf-fltkernel-fltsetcancelcompletion.md">FltSetCancelCompletion</a>. 

To clear a cancel routine that was set for an I/O operation, call <a href="..\fltkernel\nf-fltkernel-fltclearcancelcompletion.md">FltClearCancelCompletion</a>.
