# FltGetNewSystemBufferAddress function
The <b>FltGetNewSystemBufferAddress</b> function retrieves the AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer buffer, which the file system has allocated. A minifilter driver's post-callback routine calls this function.

## Syntax

````
PVOID FltGetNewSystemBufferAddress(
  _In_ PFLT_CALLBACK_DATA CallbackData
);
````

## Parameters

`CallbackData`

A pointer to a <a href="..\fltkernel\ns-fltkernel-_flt_callback_data.md">FLT_CALLBACK_DATA</a> structure that represents an I/O operation.


## Return Value

If the AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer buffer was allocated by the file system, <b>FltGetNewSystemBufferAddress</b> returns a pointer to this buffer; otherwise it returns <b>NULL</b>.

## Remarks

A minifilter driver's post-callback routine calls <b>FltGetNewSystemBufferAddress</b> function to retrieve a pointer to the AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer buffer that the file system has allocated.  A minifilter driver should call this function only when the FLTFL_CALLBACK_DATA_NEW_SYSTEM_BUFFER flag is set in <i>CallbackData.Flags</i>. 

When the file system allocates its own AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer buffer, Filter Manager will set the FLTFL_CALLBACK_DATA_NEW_SYSTEM_BUFFER flag.  This signals the minifilter that the buffer they received in the pre-operation is not the one that has the data read from the file system. 

If the FLTFL_CALLBACK_DATA_NEW_SYSTEM_BUFFER flag is not set, then this routine returns <b>NULL</b>.
