# FltIsOperationSynchronous function
The <b>FltIsOperationSynchronous</b> routine determines whether a given callback data structure (<a href="..\fltkernel\ns-fltkernel-_flt_callback_data.md">FLT_CALLBACK_DATA</a>) represents a synchronous or asynchronous I/O operation.

## Syntax

````
BOOLEAN FltIsOperationSynchronous(
  _In_ PFLT_CALLBACK_DATA CallbackData
);
````

## Parameters

`CallbackData`

Pointer to the callback data structure for the operation (<a href="..\fltkernel\ns-fltkernel-_flt_callback_data.md">FLT_CALLBACK_DATA</a>).


## Return Value

<b>FltIsOperationSynchronous</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the operation is synchronous, and <b>FALSE</b> if the operation is asynchronous.

## Remarks

<b>FltIsOperationSynchronous</b> determines whether a given callback data structure (<a href="..\fltkernel\ns-fltkernel-_flt_callback_data.md">FLT_CALLBACK_DATA</a>) represents a synchronous or asynchronous I/O operation, according to the following conditions: 
<ul>
<li>
If the operation is not an IRP-based I/O operation, the operation is synchronous. To determine whether an operation is IRP-based, use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544654">FLT_IS_IRP_OPERATION</a> macro. 

</li>
<li>
If the operation is an asynchronous paging I/O operation, the operation is asynchronous, even if one of the other conditions in this list is true. 

</li>
<li>
If the operation is a synchronous paging I/O operation, the operation is synchronous. 

</li>
<li>
If the file object for the operation was opened for synchronous I/O, the operation is synchronous. 

</li>
<li>
If the IRP_SYNCHRONOUS_API flag is set in the IRP for the operation, the operation is synchronous. This flag is set for operations, such as IRP_MJ_QUERY_INFORMATION and IRP_MJ_SET_INFORMATION, that are always synchronous, even when performed on a file object that was opened for asynchronous I/O. 

</li>
<li>
If none of the above conditions is true, the operation is asynchronous. 

</li>
</ul><div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  <b>FltIsOperationSynchronous</b>  also returns <b>TRUE</b> if the callback data structure represents an IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL, IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL, or IRP_MJ_FILE_SYSTEM_CONTROL operation with an I/O control code (IOCTL) or file system control code (FSCTL) that was defined with METHOD_BUFFERED, even if the file object was opened for asynchronous I/O. Such a request is likely to be made synchronous by the file system, but this is not necessarily true in all cases. </div><div> </div><div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    When <b>FltIsOperationSynchronous</b> returns <b>TRUE</b>, this does not indicate that the I/O operation is synchronized. That is, the <b>TRUE</b> value does not indicate that a minifilter driver returned FLT_PREOP_SYNCHRONIZE in the preoperation callback (<a href="..\fltkernel\nc-fltkernel-pflt_post_operation_callback.md">PFLT_POST_OPERATION_CALLBACK</a>) routine for this operation. Instead, <b>FltIsOperationSynchronous</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> to indicate that the I/O operation is synchronous from the I/O manager's perspective. </div><div> </div><b>FltIsOperationSynchronous</b> can be called for all classes of operations: fast I/O, file system filter (FSFilter) callbacks, and IRP-based operations.
