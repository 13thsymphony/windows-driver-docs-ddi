# PFND3D10DDI_DESTROYDEVICE callback



## -description
<p>The <b>DestroyDevice(D3D10)</b> function destroys the specified device object. </p>


## -prototype

````
PFND3D10DDI_DESTROYDEVICE DestroyDevice;

VOID  APIENTRY DestroyDevice(
   D3D10DDI_HDEVICE hDevice
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters
<dl>

### -param <i>hDevice</i> 

<dd>
<p> A handle to the display device (graphics context). The Microsoft Direct3D runtime will free the memory region that it previously allocated for the object. Therefore, the driver can no longer access this memory region. </p>
</dd>
</dl>

## -returns
<p>None</p>

<p>The driver can use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/968b04a7-8869-410c-a6fc-83d57726858f">pfnSetErrorCb</a> callback function to set an error code. For more information about setting error codes, see the Remarks section. </p>

## -remarks
<p>Before the Direct3D runtime calls <b>DestroyDevice(D3D10)</b>, it destroys all of the display device's child objects (blend state, resources, and so on).</p>

<p>The driver should not encounter any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED. Therefore, if the driver passes any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED, in a call to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/968b04a7-8869-410c-a6fc-83d57726858f">pfnSetErrorCb</a> function, the Direct3D runtime will determine that the error is critical. Even if the device was removed, the driver is not required to return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED; however, if device removal interfered with the operation of <b>DestroyDevice(D3D10)</b> (which typically should not happen), the driver can return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED.</p>
