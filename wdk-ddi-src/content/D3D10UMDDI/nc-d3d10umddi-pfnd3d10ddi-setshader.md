# PFND3D10DDI_SETSHADER callback



## -description
<p>The <b>CsSetShader</b> function sets the compute shader code so that all of the subsequent dispatching operations use that code. </p>


## -prototype

````
PFND3D10DDI_SETSHADER CsSetShader;

VOID APIENTRY CsSetShader(
  _In_ D3D10DDI_HDEVICE hDevice,
  _In_ D3D10DDI_HSHADER hShader
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters
<dl>

### -param <i>hDevice</i> [in]

<dd>
<p> A handle to the display device (graphics context).</p>
</dd>

### -param <i>hShader</i> [in]

<dd>
<p> A handle to the compute shader code object. </p>
</dd>
</dl>

## -returns
<p>None</p>

<p>The driver can use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/968b04a7-8869-410c-a6fc-83d57726858f">pfnSetErrorCb</a> callback function to set an error code. For more information about setting error codes, see the following Remarks section.</p>

## -remarks
<p>The driver should not encounter any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED. Therefore, if the driver passes any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED, in a call to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/968b04a7-8869-410c-a6fc-83d57726858f">pfnSetErrorCb</a> function, the Direct3D runtime determines that the error is critical. Even if the device is removed, the driver is not required to return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED; however, if device removal interferes with the operation of<b>CsSetShader</b> (which typically should not happen), the driver can return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED.</p>
