# PFND3D10DDI_DESTROYSHADERRESOURCEVIEW callback



## -description
<p>The <b>DestroyShaderResourceView</b> function destroys the specified shader resource view object. The shader resource view object can be destoyed only if it is not currently bound to a display device. </p>


## -prototype

````
PFND3D10DDI_DESTROYSHADERRESOURCEVIEW DestroyShaderResourceView;

VOID APIENTRY DestroyShaderResourceView(
  _In_ D3D10DDI_HDEVICE             hDevice,
  _In_ D3D10DDI_HSHADERRESOURCEVIEW hShaderResourceView
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters
<dl>

### -param <i>hDevice</i> [in]

<dd>
<p> A handle to the display device (graphics context).</p>
</dd>

### -param <i>hShaderResourceView</i> [in]

<dd>
<p> A handle to the driver's private data for the shader resource view object to destroy. The Microsoft Direct3D runtime will free the memory region that it previously allocated for the object. Therefore, the driver can no longer access this memory region. </p>
</dd>
</dl>

## -returns
<p>None</p>

<p>The driver can use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/968b04a7-8869-410c-a6fc-83d57726858f">pfnSetErrorCb</a> callback function to set an error code. For more information about setting error codes, see the following Remarks section.</p>

## -remarks
<p>The driver should not encounter any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED. Therefore, if the driver passes any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED, in a call to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/968b04a7-8869-410c-a6fc-83d57726858f">pfnSetErrorCb</a> function, the Direct3D runtime will determine that the error is critical. Even if the device was removed, the driver is not required to return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED; however, if device removal interfered with the operation of <b>DestroyShaderResourceView</b> (which typically should not happen), the driver can return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED.</p>
