# PFND3D10DDI_DRAWAUTO callback



## -description
<p>The <b>DrawAuto</b> function works similarly to the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi-draw.md">Draw</a> function, except <b>DrawAuto</b> is used for the special case where vertex data is written through the stream-output unit and then recycled as a vertex buffer. The driver determines the number of primitives, in part, by how much data was written to the buffer through stream output. </p>


## -prototype

````
PFND3D10DDI_DRAWAUTO DrawAuto;

VOID APIENTRY DrawAuto(
  _In_ D3D10DDI_HDEVICE hDevice
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters
<dl>

### -param <i>hDevice</i> [in]

<dd>
<p> A handle to the display device (graphics context).</p>
</dd>
</dl>

## -returns
<p>None</p>

<p>The driver can use the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi-seterror-cb.md">pfnSetErrorCb</a> callback function to set an error code. For more information about setting error codes, see the following Remarks section.</p>

## -remarks
<p>The driver should not encounter any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED. Therefore, if the driver passes any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED, in a call to the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi-seterror-cb.md">pfnSetErrorCb</a> function, the Direct3D runtime will determine that the error is critical. Even if the device was removed, the driver is not required to return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED; however, if device removal interfered with the operation of <b>DrawAuto</b> (which typically should not happen), the driver can return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED.</p>
