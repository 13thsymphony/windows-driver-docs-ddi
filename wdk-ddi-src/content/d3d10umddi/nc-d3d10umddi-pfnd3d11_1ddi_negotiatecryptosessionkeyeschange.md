# PFND3D11_1DDI_NEGOTIATECRYPTOSESSIONKEYESCHANGE callback function
Establishes a session key for a cryptographic session object.

## Syntax

```
PFND3D11_1DDI_NEGOTIATECRYPTOSESSIONKEYESCHANGE Pfnd3d111DdiNegotiatecryptosessionkeyeschange;

HRESULT Pfnd3d111DdiNegotiatecryptosessionkeyeschange(
  D3D10DDI_HDEVICE hDevice,
  D3D11_1DDI_HCRYPTOSESSION hCryptoSession,
  UINT DataSize,
  BYTE *pData
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`hDevice`

A handle to the display device (graphics context).

`hCryptoSession`

A handle to the cryptographic session object that was created through a call to the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d11_1ddi_createcryptosession.md">CreateCryptoSession</a> function.

`DataSize`

The size, in bytes, of the data in the <i>pData</i> array.

`*pData`

A pointer to a byte array that contains the encrypted session key.


## Return Value

<i>NegotiateCryptoSessionKeyExchange</i> returns one of the following values:
<table>

<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>

<td width="60%">

<dt><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">

        Memory was not available to complete the operation.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

The <i>pData</i> parameter references a buffer that contains a session key for the cryptographic session. The key exchange mechanism depends on the type of the encryption algorithm that is used by the cryptographic session.

For sessions that use the RSA Encryption Scheme - Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (RSAES-OAEP) algorithm, the key buffer must contain 256 bytes of data and must be encrypted by using the RSA Encryption Scheme - Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (RSAES-OAEP) algorithm with the public key from the cryptographic session certificate.

The key exchange for a cryptographic session is identical to the key exchange for the Output Protection Manager (OPM) interface. However,  the OPM key buffer contains additional data besides the session key.
