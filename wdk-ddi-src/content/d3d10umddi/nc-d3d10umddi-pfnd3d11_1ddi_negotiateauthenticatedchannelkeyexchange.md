# PFND3D11_1DDI_NEGOTIATEAUTHENTICATEDCHANNELKEYEXCHANGE callback function
Establishes a session key for an authenticated channel.

## Syntax

```
PFND3D11_1DDI_NEGOTIATEAUTHENTICATEDCHANNELKEYEXCHANGE Pfnd3d111DdiNegotiateauthenticatedchannelkeyexchange;

HRESULT Pfnd3d111DdiNegotiateauthenticatedchannelkeyexchange(
  D3D10DDI_HDEVICE hDevice,
  D3D11_1DDI_HAUTHCHANNEL hCAuthChannel,
  UINT DataSize,
  VOID *pData
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`hDevice`

A handle to the display device (graphics context).

`hCAuthChannel`

A handle to an authenticated channel object that was created through a call to the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d11_1ddi_createauthenticatedchannel.md">CreateAuthenticatedChannel(D3D11_1)</a> function.

`DataSize`

The size, in bytes, of the data in the <i>pData</i> array.

`*pData`




## Return Value

<b>NegotiateAuthenticatedChannelKeyExchange</b> returns one of the following values:
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The session key for the authenticated channel was negotiated successfully.
<dl>
<dt><b>E_INVALIDARG</b></dt>
</dl>Parameters were validated and determined to be incorrect.
<dl>
<dt><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b></dt>
</dl>
        Memory was not available to complete the operation.

## Remarks

The <i>pData</i> parameter references a buffer that contains a session key for the authenticated channel. This key buffer must contain 256 bytes of data and must be encrypted by using the RSA Encryption Scheme - Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (RSAES-OAEP) algorithm with the public key from the authenticated channel certificate.

The key exchange for an authenticated channel is identical to the key exchange for the Output Protection Manager (OPM) interface. However,  the OPM key buffer contains additional data besides the session key.
