# PFND3D11_1DDI_NEGOTIATEAUTHENTICATEDCHANNELKEYEXCHANGE callback



## -description
Establishes a session key for an authenticated channel.





## -prototype

````
PFND3D11_1DDI_NEGOTIATEAUTHENTICATEDCHANNELKEYEXCHANGE pfnNegotiateAuthenticatedChannelKeyExchange;

HRESULT APIENTRY* pfnNegotiateAuthenticatedChannelKeyExchange(
  _In_ D3D10DDI_HDEVICE        hDevice,
  _In_ D3D11_1DDI_HAUTHCHANNEL hCAuthChannel,
  _In_ UINT                    DataSize,
  _In_ VOID                    *pData
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hDevice [in]

A handle to the display device (graphics context).




### -param hCAuthChannel [in]

A handle to an authenticated channel object that was created through a call to the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d11_1ddi_createauthenticatedchannel.md">CreateAuthenticatedChannel(D3D11_1)</a> function.




### -param DataSize [in]

The size, in bytes, of the data in the <i>pData</i> array.




### -param pData [in]

A pointer to a byte array that contains the encrypted session key.


## -returns
<b>NegotiateAuthenticatedChannelKeyExchange</b> returns one of the following values:
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The session key for the authenticated channel was negotiated successfully.
<dl>
<dt><b>E_INVALIDARG</b></dt>
</dl>Parameters were validated and determined to be incorrect.
<dl>
<dt><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b></dt>
</dl>
        Memory was not available to complete the operation.

 


## -remarks
The <i>pData</i> parameter references a buffer that contains a session key for the authenticated channel. This key buffer must contain 256 bytes of data and must be encrypted by using the RSA Encryption Scheme - Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (RSAES-OAEP) algorithm with the public key from the authenticated channel certificate.

The key exchange for an authenticated channel is identical to the key exchange for the Output Protection Manager (OPM) interface. However,  the OPM key buffer contains additional data besides the session key.
