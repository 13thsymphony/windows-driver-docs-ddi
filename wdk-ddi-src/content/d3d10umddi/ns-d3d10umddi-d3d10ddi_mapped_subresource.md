# D3D10DDI_MAPPED_SUBRESOURCE structure
The D3D10DDI_MAPPED_SUBRESOURCE structure describes a subresource that the driver maps to through a call to the driver's <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_resourcemap.md">ResourceMap</a> function.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct D3D10DDI_MAPPED_SUBRESOURCE {
  void *pData;
  UINT RowPitch;
  UINT DepthPitch;
} D3D10DDI_MAPPED_SUBRESOURCE;
````

## Members


`DepthPitch`

[out] The deptch pitch,  width, or physical size (in bytes) of the data.

`pData`

[out] A pointer to a buffer that contains the contents of the subresource.

`RowPitch`

[out] The row pitch,  width, or physical size (in bytes) of the data.

## Remarks
The <b>pData</b> member points to row 0 and slice 0.

The <b>RowPitch</b> member is the value that is added to <b>pData</b> to move from row to row. Each row should contain multiple pixels.

The <b>DepthPitch</b> member is the value that is added to <b>pData</b> to move from depth slice to depth slice. Each depth slice should contain multiple rows.

It is not advisable to assign a value of zero to the <b>RowPitch</b> and <b>DepthPitch</b> members.

To avoid zero values for these members, it helps to think of all  resources as being three-dimensional, as in these two examples:
<ul>
<li>If the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e9cd2bc7-99c1-4aca-91b0-9faefa4a856d">resource attribute</a> is Buffer or Texture1D and contains  8 bytes, then appropriate values  for <b>RowPitch</b> and <b>DepthPitch</b> would be 8 or more.</li>
<li>If the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e9cd2bc7-99c1-4aca-91b0-9faefa4a856d">resource attribute</a> is Texture2d, even if <b>DepthPitch</b> is not used, <b>DepthPitch</b> must not be assigned a value of zero.</li>
</ul>

## Requirements
