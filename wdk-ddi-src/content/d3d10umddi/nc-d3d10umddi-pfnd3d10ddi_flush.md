# PFND3D10DDI_FLUSH callback



## -description
The <i>Flush(D3D10)</i> function submits outstanding hardware commands that are in the hardware command buffer to the display miniport driver. 


## -prototype

````
PFND3D10DDI_FLUSH Flush;

VOID APIENTRY Flush(
  _In_ D3D10DDI_HDEVICE hDevice
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hDevice [in]

 A handle to the display device (graphics context).

## -returns
None

The driver can use the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb.md">pfnSetErrorCb</a> callback function to set an error code. For more information about setting error codes, see the following Remarks section.

## -remarks
After the <i>Flush(D3D10)</i> function completes, all previously issued commands no longer depend on actions that occur within the application's user-mode context. In addition, applications can safely suspend themselves without blocking rendering until the kernel restarts them (such as, when an asynchronous query is used).

The driver should not encounter any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED. Therefore, if the driver passes any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED, in a call to the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb.md">pfnSetErrorCb</a> function, the Direct3D runtime will determine that the error is critical. Even if the device was removed, the driver is not required to return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED; however, if device removal interfered with the operation of <i>Flush(D3D10)</i> (which typically should not happen), the driver can return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED.
