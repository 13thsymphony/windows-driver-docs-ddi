# PFND3D10DDI_DRAWAUTO callback function
The <b>DrawAuto</b> function works similarly to the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_draw.md">Draw</a> function, except <b>DrawAuto</b> is used for the special case where vertex data is written through the stream-output unit and then recycled as a vertex buffer. The driver determines the number of primitives, in part, by how much data was written to the buffer through stream output.

## Syntax

```
PFND3D10DDI_DRAWAUTO Pfnd3d10ddiDrawauto;

void Pfnd3d10ddiDrawauto(
   D3D10DDI_HDEVICE
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`D3D10DDI_HDEVICE`




## Return Value

None

The driver can use the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb.md">pfnSetErrorCb</a> callback function to set an error code. For more information about setting error codes, see the following Remarks section.

## Remarks

The driver should not encounter any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED. Therefore, if the driver passes any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED, in a call to the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb.md">pfnSetErrorCb</a> function, the Direct3D runtime will determine that the error is critical. Even if the device was removed, the driver is not required to return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED; however, if device removal interfered with the operation of <b>DrawAuto</b> (which typically should not happen), the driver can return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED.
