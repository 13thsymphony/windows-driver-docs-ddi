# PFND3D10DDI_DRAWINDEXEDINSTANCED callback



## -description
<p>The <b>DrawIndexedInstanced</b> function draws particular instances of indexed primitives.</p>


## -prototype

````
PFND3D10DDI_DRAWINDEXEDINSTANCED DrawIndexedInstanced;

VOID APIENTRY DrawIndexedInstanced(
  _In_ D3D10DDI_HDEVICE hDevice,
  _In_ UINT             IndexCountPerInstance,
  _In_ UINT             InstanceCount,
  _In_ UINT             StartIndexLocation,
  _In_ INT              BaseVertexLocation,
  _In_ UINT             StartInstanceLocation
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters
<dl>

### -param <i>hDevice</i> [in]

<dd>
<p>A handle to the display device (graphics context).</p>
</dd>

### -param <i>IndexCountPerInstance</i> [in]

<dd>
<p>The number of indexes per instance of the index buffer that indexes are read from to draw the primitives. </p>
</dd>

### -param <i>InstanceCount</i> [in]

<dd>
<p>The number of instances of the index buffer that indexes are read from to draw the primitives. </p>
</dd>

### -param <i>StartIndexLocation</i> [in]

<dd>
<p>The first index in the index buffer that indexes are read from to draw the primitives. </p>
</dd>

### -param <i>BaseVertexLocation</i> [in]

<dd>
<p>The number that should be added to each index that is referenced by the various primitives to determine the actual index of the vertex elements in each vertex stream.</p>
</dd>

### -param <i>StartInstanceLocation</i> [in]

<dd>
<p>The first instance of the index buffer that indexes are read from to draw the primitives. </p>
</dd>
</dl>

## -returns
<p>None</p>

<p>The driver can use the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi-seterror-cb.md">pfnSetErrorCb</a> callback function to set an error code. For more information about setting error codes, see the Remarks section. 

</p>

## -remarks
<p>The driver should not encounter any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED. Therefore, if the driver passes any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED, in a call to the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi-seterror-cb.md">pfnSetErrorCb</a> function, the Direct3D runtime will determine that the error is critical. Even if the device was removed, the driver is not required to return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED; however, if device removal interfered with the operation of <i>DrawIndexedInstanced</i> (which typically should not happen), the driver can return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED.</p>
