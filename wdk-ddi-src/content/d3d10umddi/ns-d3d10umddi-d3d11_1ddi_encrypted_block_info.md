# D3D11_1DDI_ENCRYPTED_BLOCK_INFO structure
Specifies which bytes in a video surface are encrypted.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct D3D11_1DDI_ENCRYPTED_BLOCK_INFO {
  UINT NumEncryptedBytesAtBeginning;
  UINT NumBytesInSkipPattern;
  UINT NumBytesInEncryptPattern;
} D3D11_1DDI_ENCRYPTED_BLOCK_INFO;
````

## Members

        
            `NumBytesInEncryptPattern`

            The number of bytes that are encrypted after each block of skipped bytes.

The skip and encrypt pattern is then repeated until the buffer ends. For more information about the skip-encrypt pattern, see the Remarks section.
        
            `NumBytesInSkipPattern`

            The number of bytes that are skipped after the first <b>NumEncryptedBytesAtBeginning</b> bytes, and then after each block of <b>NumBytesInEncryptPattern</b> bytes. Skipped bytes are not encrypted.
        
            `NumEncryptedBytesAtBeginning`

            The number of bytes that are encrypted at the start of the buffer.

    ## Remarks
        Because the buffer's encrypted portion is specified in bytes, an application must ensure that the encrypted blocks match the GPU's crypto-block alignment.

The following examples show how the runtime can partition a buffer's encryption.</p>
