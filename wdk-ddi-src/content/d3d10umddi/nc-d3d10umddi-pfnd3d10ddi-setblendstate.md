# PFND3D10DDI_SETBLENDSTATE callback



## -description
<p>The <i>SetBlendState</i> function sets a blend state. </p>


## -prototype

````
PFND3D10DDI_SETBLENDSTATE SetBlendState;

VOID APIENTRY SetBlendState(
  _In_       D3D10DDI_HDEVICE     hDevice,
  _In_       D3D10DDI_HBLENDSTATE hState,
  _In_ const FLOAT                pBlendFactor,
  _In_       UINT                 SampleMask
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters
<dl>

### -param <i>hDevice</i> [in]

<dd>
<p> A handle to the display device (graphics context).</p>
</dd>

### -param <i>hState</i> [in]

<dd>
<p> A handle to the blend state to set.</p>
</dd>

### -param <i>pBlendFactor</i> [in]

<dd>
<p> A four-element array of single-precision float vectors that the driver uses to set the blend state.</p>
</dd>

### -param <i>SampleMask</i> [in]

<dd>
<p> A sample format mask.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

## -returns
<p>None</p>

<p>The driver can use the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi-seterror-cb.md">pfnSetErrorCb</a> callback function to set an error code. For more information about setting error codes, see the following Remarks section.</p>

## -remarks
<p>The driver should not encounter any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED. Therefore, if the driver passes any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED, in a call to the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi-seterror-cb.md">pfnSetErrorCb</a> function, the Microsoft Direct3D runtime will determine that the error is critical. Even if the device was removed, the driver is not required to return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED; however, if device removal interfered with the operation of <i>SetBlendState</i> (which typically should not happen), the driver can return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED.</p>
