# PFND3D10DDI_DESTROYDEVICE callback function
The <b>DestroyDevice(D3D10)</b> function destroys the specified device object.

## Syntax

```
PFND3D10DDI_DESTROYDEVICE Pfnd3d10ddiDestroydevice;

void Pfnd3d10ddiDestroydevice(
   D3D10DDI_HDEVICE
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`D3D10DDI_HDEVICE`




## Return Value

None

The driver can use the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb.md">pfnSetErrorCb</a> callback function to set an error code. For more information about setting error codes, see the Remarks section.

## Remarks

Before the Direct3D runtime calls <b>DestroyDevice(D3D10)</b>, it destroys all of the display device's child objects (blend state, resources, and so on).

The driver should not encounter any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED. Therefore, if the driver passes any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED, in a call to the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb.md">pfnSetErrorCb</a> function, the Direct3D runtime will determine that the error is critical. Even if the device was removed, the driver is not required to return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED; however, if device removal interfered with the operation of <b>DestroyDevice(D3D10)</b> (which typically should not happen), the driver can return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED.
