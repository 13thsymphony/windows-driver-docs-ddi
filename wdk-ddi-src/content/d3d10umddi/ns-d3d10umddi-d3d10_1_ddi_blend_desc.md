# D3D10_1_DDI_BLEND_DESC structure



## -description
The D3D10_1_DDI_BLEND_DESC structure describes a blend state.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct D3D10_1_DDI_BLEND_DESC {
  BOOL                                AlphaToCoverageEnable;
  BOOL                                IndependentBlendEnable;
  D3D10_DDI_RENDER_TARGET_BLEND_DESC1 RenderTarget[D3D10_DDI_SIMULTANEOUS_RENDER_TARGET_COUNT];
} D3D10_1_DDI_BLEND_DESC;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field AlphaToCoverageEnable

[in] A Boolean value that specifies whether transparency coverage is enabled. <b>TRUE</b> indicates transparency coverage is enabled; <b>FALSE</b> indicates transparency coverage is disabled. This member is relevant for multiple-sample antialiasing only.


### -field IndependentBlendEnable

[in] A Boolean value that specifies only whether the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10_1ddi_calcprivateblendstatesize.md">CalcPrivateBlendStateSize(D3D10_1)</a> function replicated the first entry in the array that the <b>RenderTarget</b> member specifies to the other entries of that array. <b>TRUE</b> indicates the first entry was not replicated; <b>FALSE</b> indicates that the first entry in the array in the <b>RenderTarget</b> member is replicated to the other entries of the array. 


### -field RenderTarget

[in] An array of <a href="..\d3d10umddi\ns-d3d10umddi-d3d10_ddi_render_target_blend_desc1.md">D3D10_DDI_RENDER_TARGET_BLEND_DESC1</a> structures that indicate the blend state for each associated render target.
