# PFND3D10DDI_OPENADAPTER callback function
The <i>OpenAdapter10</i> function creates a graphics adapter object that is referenced in subsequent calls.

## Syntax

```
PFND3D10DDI_OPENADAPTER Pfnd3d10ddiOpenadapter;

HRESULT Pfnd3d10ddiOpenadapter(
  D3D10DDIARG_OPENADAPTER *
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`*`




## Return Value

<i>OpenAdapter10</i> returns one of the following values:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The graphics adapter object was successfully created.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>E_OUTOFMEMORY</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
<i>OpenAdapter10</i> could not allocate memory that was required for it to complete.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

The graphics adapter object that is created by the <i>OpenAdapter10</i> function represents the underlying graphics hardware. Before the Direct3D runtime can create a display device by calling <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_createdevice.md">CreateDevice(D3D10)</a>, the user-mode display driver should call the <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_queryadapterinfocb.md">pfnQueryAdapterInfoCb</a> function to query for the graphics hardware capabilities from the display miniport driver. 

The Direct3D runtime can open multiple graphics adapter objects from a single graphics adapter.
