## Remarks

A display device is a graphics context that is used to hold a collection of rendering state. The same process can create multiple devices on a given adapter. Note that the number of display devices that can simultaneously exist is limited only by available system memory. That is, a driver cannot hardcode a maximum device limit.

Generally, devices are independent of each other, so that resources that are created in one device cannot be referenced or accessed by resources that are created in another. However, cross-process resources are an exception to this rule.
