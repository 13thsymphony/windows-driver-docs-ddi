# PFND3D11_1DDI_VIDEOPROCESSORGETSTREAMEXTENSION callback



## -description
Returns the private state data for a video processor stream to an application.



## -prototype

````
PFND3D11_1DDI_VIDEOPROCESSORGETSTREAMEXTENSION pfnVideoProcessorGetStreamExtension;

HRESULT APIENTRY* pfnVideoProcessorGetStreamExtension(
  _In_          D3D10DDI_HDEVICE           hDevice,
  _In_          D3D11_1DDI_HVIDEOPROCESSOR hVideoProcessor,
  _In_          UINT                       StreamIndex,
  _In_    const GUID                       *pGuid,
  _In_          UINT                       DataSize,
  _Inout_       void                       *pData
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hDevice [in]

A handle to the display device (graphics context).




### -param hVideoProcessor [in]

A handle to the video processor object that was created through a call to the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d11_1ddi_createvideoprocessor.md">CreateVideoProcessor</a> function. 




### -param StreamIndex [in]

The zero-based index of the input stream.


### -param pGuid [in]

A pointer to a GUID that identifies the private state data. The meaning of this GUID is defined by the graphics driver.




### -param DataSize [in]

The size, in bytes, of the private state data in the buffer referenced by the <i>pData</i> parameter.


### -param pData [in, out]

A pointer to a buffer that contains the private state data. 




## -returns
<b>VideoProcessorGetStreamExtension</b> returns one of the following values:
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The private state data was returned successfully.
<dl>
<dt><b>D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED</b></dt>
</dl>The graphics adapter was removed.

<dl>
<dt><b>E_FAIL</b></dt>
</dl>
        The display miniport driver cannot set the requested private state data for the video processor.
<dl>
<dt><b>E_INVALIDARG</b></dt>
</dl>Parameters were validated and determined to be incorrect.


 


## -remarks
The Microsoft Direct3D runtime does not validate any parameter data before it calls the  <b>VideoProcessorGetStreamExtension</b> function.
