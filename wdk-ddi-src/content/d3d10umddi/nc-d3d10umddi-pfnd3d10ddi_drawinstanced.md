# PFND3D10DDI_DRAWINSTANCED callback function
The <b>DrawInstanced</b> function draws particular instances of nonindexed primitives.

## Syntax

```
PFND3D10DDI_DRAWINSTANCED Pfnd3d10ddiDrawinstanced;

void Pfnd3d10ddiDrawinstanced(
   D3D10DDI_HDEVICE,
   UINT,
   UINT,
   UINT,
   UINT
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`D3D10DDI_HDEVICE`



`UINT`



`UINT`



`UINT`



`UINT`




## Return Value

None

The driver can use the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb.md">pfnSetErrorCb</a> callback function to set an error code. For more information about setting error codes, see the following Remarks section.

## Remarks

The driver should not encounter any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED. Therefore, if the driver passes any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED, in a call to the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb.md">pfnSetErrorCb</a> function, the Direct3D runtime will determine that the error is critical. Even if the device was removed, the driver is not required to return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED; however, if device removal interfered with the operation of <b>DrawInstanced</b> (which typically should not happen), the driver can return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED.
