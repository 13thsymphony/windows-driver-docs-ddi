## -parameters

### -param hDevice [in]

 A handle to the display device (graphics context).


### -param phRenderTargetView [in]

 An array of handles to the render target view objects to set. Note that some handle values can be <b>NULL</b>. 


### -param NumRTVs [in]

 The number of elements in the array that <i>phRenderTargetView</i> specifies for the render target views (RTVs) to set. 


### -param RTVNumbertoUnbind [in]

 The number of render target view (RTV) objects to unbind (that is, those render target view objects that are previously set but should be no longer set). 


### -param hDepthStencilView [in]

 A handle to the depth-stencil buffer to set. 


### -param phUnorderedAccessView [in]

 An array of handles to the unordered access view (UAV) objects. 


### -param pUAVInitialCounts [in]

An array of append and consume buffer offsets. <i>pUAV</i> is only relevant for unordered access views (UAVs)  of the <i>phUnorderedAccessView</i> array that were created with either <b>D3D11_DDI_BUFFER_UAV_FLAG_APPEND</b>  or <b>D3D11_DDI_BUFFER_UAV_FLAG_COUNTER</b> set in the <b>Flags</b> member of the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\ns-d3d10umddi-d3d11ddiarg_buffer_unorderedaccessview.md">D3D11DDIARG_BUFFER_UNORDEREDACCESSVIEW</a> structure when the UAV was created; otherwise, the argument is ignored. If an element in this array is set to -1, the current offset for that append and consume buffer should be kept. Any other value causes the driver to set the hidden counter for that UAV append and consume buffer.


### -param UAVIndex [in]

Indicates the start element, in the array of bind points, where the passed unordered access view (UAV) array is going to be applied. <i>UAVIndex</i> should be at least as great as  the <i>NumRTVs</i> parameter.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Only one shared set of binding points exists for render target views (RTVs) and UAVs. RTVs are bound first, followed by UAVs.</div>
<div> </div>

### -param NumUAVs [in]

 The number of unordered access view objects (UAVs) to set. 


### -param UAVFirsttoSet [in]

 The first unordered access view object (UAV) in the set of all updated UAVs (which includes <b>NULL</b> bindings). 


### -param UAVNumberUpdated [in]

 The number of unordered access view objects (UAVs) in the set of all updated UAVs (which includes <b>NULL</b> bindings). 

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The parameters <i>UAVNumberUpdated</i> and  <i>UAVFirsttoSet</i> specify which range, in the  UAVs array, contains changes in relation to the state previously bound. Notice that points in the range could be unchanged. Also, update range indexing is not different from other parameters. For example, <i>UAVFirsttoSet</i>      starts at 0 as the first element of the shared render target view (RTV) and UAV bound space. This parameter is a convenience that reveals the span of what actually changed given that the Direct3D DDI always binds everything (including what has not changed).</div>
<div> </div>

## -returns
None

The driver can use the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb.md">pfnSetErrorCb</a> callback function to set an error code. For more information about setting error codes, see the following Remarks section.


## -remarks
The driver should not encounter any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED. Therefore, if the driver passes any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED, in a call to the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb.md">pfnSetErrorCb</a> function, the Microsoft Direct3D runtime determines that the error is critical. Even if the device is removed, the driver is not required to return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED; however, if device removal interferes with the operation of <i>SetRenderTargets(D3D11)</i> (which typically should not happen), the driver can return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED.
