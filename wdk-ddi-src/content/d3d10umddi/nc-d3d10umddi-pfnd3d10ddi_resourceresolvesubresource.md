# PFND3D10DDI_RESOURCERESOLVESUBRESOURCE callback



## -description
The <i>ResourceResolveSubresource</i> function resolves multiple samples to one pixel.



## -prototype

````
PFND3D10DDI_RESOURCERESOLVESUBRESOURCE ResourceResolveSubresource;

VOID APIENTRY ResourceResolveSubresource(
  _In_ D3D10DDI_HDEVICE   hDevice,
  _In_ D3D10DDI_HRESOURCE hDstResource,
  _In_ UINT               DstSubresource,
  _In_ D3D10DDI_HRESOURCE hSrcResource,
  _In_ UINT               SrcSubresource,
  _In_ DXGI_FORMAT        ResolveFormat
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hDevice [in]

 A handle to the display device (graphics context).


### -param hDstResource [in]

 A handle to the destination resource to resolve to. This resource must have been created as D3D10_USAGE_DEFAULT and single sampled.


### -param DstSubresource [in]

 An index that indicates the destination subresource to resolve to. 


### -param hSrcResource [in]

 A handle to the source resource to resolve from.


### -param SrcSubresource [in]

 An index that indicates the source subresource to resolve from. 


### -param ResolveFormat [in]

 A DXGI_FORMAT-typed value that indicates how to interpret the contents of the resolved resource.


## -returns
None

The driver can use the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb.md">pfnSetErrorCb</a> callback function to set an error code. 


## -remarks
The algorithm to resolve multiple samples to one pixel depends on the implementation. 

The resolve operation shares similar restrictions to copy operations that occur in calls to the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_resourcecopy.md">ResourceCopy</a> and <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_resourcecopyregion.md">ResourceCopyRegion</a> functions. That is, both source and destination resources must be the same type (for example, Texture2D), and no stretching or format conversions can occur. The driver can resolve only a whole subresource; therefore, both the source and destination subresources must be equal in dimensions. Because of typeless resources, the following interactions can exist with either the source or destination resource format: 

If each resource is prestructured plus typed, both resources must have the same format type, and that format type must match the format type that was passed in the <i>ResolveFormat</i> parameter (for example, all R32_FLOAT). 

If one resource is prestructured plus typeless, the prestructured-plus-typed resource's format must be compatible with the typeless format, and the format type that was passed in the <i>ResolveFormat</i> parameter must match the prestructured-plus-typed format (for example, if the source format is R32_TYPELESS, and the destination format and <i>ResolveFormat</i> are R32_FLOAT). 

If both resources are prestructured plus typeless, they must be equal formats, and the format type that was passed in the <i>ResolveFormat</i> parameter can be any format that is compatible with the typeless format. (for example, if the source and destination format are R32_TYPELESS, and <i>ResolveFormat</i> is R32_FLOAT or R32_UINT).
