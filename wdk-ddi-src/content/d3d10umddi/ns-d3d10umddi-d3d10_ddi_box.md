# D3D10_DDI_BOX structure
The D3D10_DDI_BOX structure describes a volume.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct D3D10_DDI_BOX {
  LONG left;
  LONG top;
  LONG front;
  LONG right;
  LONG bottom;
  LONG back;
} D3D10_DDI_BOX;
````

## Members


`back`

[in] The position of the back of the box on the z-axis. Note that the depth of the volume equals the value in the <b>back</b> member minus the value in the <b>front</b> member (that is, depth = back – front).

`bottom`

[in] The position of the bottom of the box on the y-axis. Note that the height of the volume equals the value in the <b>bottom</b> member minus the value in the <b>top</b> member (that is, height = bottom – top).

`front`

[in] The position of the front of the box on the z-axis.

`left`

[in] The position of the left side of the box on the x-axis.

`right`

[in] The position of the right side of the box on the x-axis. Note that the width of the volume equals the value in the <b>right</b> member minus the value in the <b>left</b> member (that is, width = right – left).

`top`

[in] The position of the top of the box on the y-axis.
