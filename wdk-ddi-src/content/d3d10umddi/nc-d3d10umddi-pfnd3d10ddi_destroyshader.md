# PFND3D10DDI_DESTROYSHADER callback



## -description
The <i>DestroyShader</i> function destroys the specified shader object. The shader object can be destoyed only if it is not currently bound to a display device. 



## -prototype

````
PFND3D10DDI_DESTROYSHADER DestroyShader;

VOID APIENTRY DestroyShader(
  _In_ D3D10DDI_HDEVICE hDevice,
  _In_ D3D10DDI_HSHADER hShader
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hDevice [in]

 A handle to the display device (graphics context).


### -param hShader [in]

 A handle to the driver's private data for the shader object to destroy. The Microsoft Direct3D runtime will free the memory region that it previously allocated for the object. Therefore, the driver can no longer access this memory region. 


## -returns
None

The driver can use the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb.md">pfnSetErrorCb</a> callback function to set an error code. For more information about setting error codes, see the following Remarks section.


## -remarks
The driver should not encounter any error, except for <b>D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED</b>. Therefore, if the driver passes any error, except for <b>D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED</b>, in a call to the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb.md">pfnSetErrorCb</a> function, the Microsoft Direct3D runtime will determine that the error is critical. Even if the device was removed, the driver is not required to return <b>D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED</b>; however, if device removal interfered with the operation of <i>DestroyShader</i> (which typically should not happen), the driver can return <b>D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED</b>.
