# PFND3D10DDI_SETBLENDSTATE callback



## -description
The <i>SetBlendState</i> function sets a blend state. 



## -prototype

````
PFND3D10DDI_SETBLENDSTATE SetBlendState;

VOID APIENTRY SetBlendState(
  _In_       D3D10DDI_HDEVICE     hDevice,
  _In_       D3D10DDI_HBLENDSTATE hState,
  _In_ const FLOAT                pBlendFactor,
  _In_       UINT                 SampleMask
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hDevice [in]

 A handle to the display device (graphics context).


### -param hState [in]

 A handle to the blend state to set.


### -param pBlendFactor [in]

 A four-element array of single-precision float vectors that the driver uses to set the blend state.


### -param SampleMask [in]

 A sample format mask.


## -returns
None

The driver can use the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb.md">pfnSetErrorCb</a> callback function to set an error code. For more information about setting error codes, see the following Remarks section.


## -remarks
The driver should not encounter any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED. Therefore, if the driver passes any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED, in a call to the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb.md">pfnSetErrorCb</a> function, the Microsoft Direct3D runtime will determine that the error is critical. Even if the device was removed, the driver is not required to return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED; however, if device removal interfered with the operation of <i>SetBlendState</i> (which typically should not happen), the driver can return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED.
