# PFND3D10DDI_SETPREDICATION callback



## -description
The <i>SetPredication</i> function specifies whether rendering and resource-manipulation commands that follow are actually performed. 



## -prototype

````
PFND3D10DDI_SETPREDICATION SetPredication;

VOID APIENTRY SetPredication(
  _In_ D3D10DDI_HDEVICE hDevice,
  _In_ D3D10DDI_HQUERY  hQuery,
  _In_ BOOL             PredicateValue
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hDevice [in]

 A handle to the display device (graphics context).


### -param hQuery [in]

 A handle to the query object to set as a predicate. Setting <i>hQuery</i> to <b>NULL</b> indicates "no predication". If <i>hQuery</i> is set to <b>NULL</b>, the driver ignores the value in the <i>PredicateValue</i> parameter; however, the driver should store the predicate value for subsequent requests for the value.


### -param PredicateValue [in]

 A Boolean value to compare with query data. If the query data is equal to the predicate value, the following rendering and resource manipulation commands are not performed. 


## -returns
None

The driver can use the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb.md">pfnSetErrorCb</a> callback function to set an error code. For more information about setting error codes, see the following Remarks section.


## -remarks
 Some predicates are only hints; therefore, they might not actually prevent operations from being performed. The Microsoft Direct3D runtime primarily calls <i>SetPredication</i> to let applications issue graphics commands without taking the performance hit of spinning and waiting for a call to the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_querygetdata.md">QueryGetData</a> function to return. Therefore, predication can occur even if <i>QueryGetData</i> returns S_FALSE. In other words, an application can also use predication as a fallback if <i>QueryGetData</i> possibly returns S_FALSE. If <i>QueryGetData</i> returns S_OK, the application can skip calling the graphics commands manually with its own application logic.

The driver should not encounter any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED. Therefore, if the driver passes any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED, in a call to the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb.md">pfnSetErrorCb</a> function, the Direct3D runtime will determine that the error is critical. Even if the device was removed, the driver is not required to return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED; however, if device removal interfered with the operation of <i>SetPredication</i> (which typically should not happen), the driver can return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED.
