`ProprietaryChargerAbortOperation`

A pointer to the driver's implementation of the <a href="..\ufxproprietarycharger\nc-ufxproprietarycharger-ufx_proprietary_charger_abort_operation.md">UFX_PROPRIETARY_CHARGER_ABORT_OPERATION</a> callback function.

`ProprietaryChargerDetect`

A pointer to the driver's implementation of the <a href="..\ufxproprietarycharger\nc-ufxproprietarycharger-ufx_proprietary_charger_detect.md">UFX_PROPRIETARY_CHARGER_DETECT</a> callback function.

`ProprietaryChargerResetOperation`

A pointer to the driver's implementation of the <a href="..\ufxproprietarycharger\nc-ufxproprietarycharger-ufx_proprietary_charger_reset_operation.md">UFX_PROPRIETARY_CHARGER_RESET_OPERATION</a> callback function.

`ProprietaryChargerSetProperty`
