# UFX_PROPRIETARY_CHARGER_DETECT function
The filter driver's implementation to detect if a charger is attached  and get details about the charger.

## Syntax

```
UFX_PROPRIETARY_CHARGER_DETECT UfxProprietaryChargerDetect;

NTSTATUS UfxProprietaryChargerDetect(
  PVOID Context,
  PUFX_PROPRIETARY_CHARGER DetectedCharger
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Context`

A pointer to a driver-defined context.

`DetectedCharger`

A pointer to a     <a href="..\ufxproprietarycharger\ns-ufxproprietarycharger-_ufx_proprietary_charger.md">UFX_PROPRIETARY_CHARGER</a> structure that the driver fills with charger information.


## Return Value

If the operation is successful, the callback function must return STATUS_SUCCESS, or another status value for which NT_SUCCESS(status) equals TRUE. Otherwise it must return a status value for which NT_SUCCESS(status) equals FALSE.

## Remarks

To support handling of proprietary chargers, the USB lower filter driver must publish support. During the publishing process, the driver also registers its implementation of this  callback function. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/05D2B46A-282C-4B75-9F5C-2FC0AF344AB9">USB filter driver for supporting proprietary chargers</a>.

In this callback function, the driver assigns the charger a GUID and sets the minimum required Dx state when the device is connected for charging.
