# _ATA_PASS_THROUGH_EX structure
The ATA_PASS_THROUGH_EX structure is used in conjunction with an <a href="..\ntddscsi\ni-ntddscsi-ioctl_ata_pass_through.md">IOCTL_ATA_PASS_THROUGH</a> request to instruct the port driver to send an embedded ATA command to the target device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _ATA_PASS_THROUGH_EX {
  USHORT    Length;
  USHORT    AtaFlags;
  UCHAR     PathId;
  UCHAR     TargetId;
  UCHAR     Lun;
  UCHAR     ReservedAsUchar;
  ULONG     DataTransferLength;
  ULONG     TimeOutValue;
  ULONG     ReservedAsUlong;
  ULONG_PTR DataBufferOffset;
  UCHAR     PreviousTaskFile[8];
  UCHAR     CurrentTaskFile[8];
} ATA_PASS_THROUGH_EX, *PATA_PASS_THROUGH_EX;
````

## Members

        
            `AtaFlags`

            Indicates the direction of data transfer and specifies the kind of operation to be performed. The value of this member must be some combination of the following flags:

<table>
<tr>
<th>ATA flags</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
ATA_FLAGS_DRDY_REQUIRED

</td>
<td>
Wait for DRDY status from the device before sending the command to the device.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
ATA_FLAGS_DATA_IN

</td>
<td>
Read data from the device.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
ATA_FLAGS_DATA_OUT

</td>
<td>
Write data to the device.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
ATA_FLAGS_48BIT_COMMAND

</td>
<td>
The ATA command to be sent uses the 48-bit logical block address (LBA) feature set. When this flag is set, the contents of the <b>PreviousTaskFile</b> member in the ATA_PASS_THROUGH_EX structure should be valid.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
ATA_FLAGS_USE_DMA

</td>
<td>
Set the transfer mode to DMA.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
ATA_FLAGS_NO_MULTIPLE

</td>
<td>
Read single sector only.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
        
            `CurrentTaskFile`

            Specifies the content of the task file register on both input and output. On input, the array values in <b>CurrentTaskFile</b> map to the task file input registers in the following manner.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Byte</th>
<th>Input Register</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
0

</td>
<td>
Features register

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
1

</td>
<td>
Sector count register

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
2

</td>
<td>
Sector number register

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
3

</td>
<td>
Cylinder low register

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
4

</td>
<td>
Cylinder high register

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
5

</td>
<td>
Device/head register

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
6

</td>
<td>
Command register

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
7

</td>
<td>
Reserved

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

When <a href="..\ntddscsi\ni-ntddscsi-ioctl_ata_pass_through.md">IOCTL_ATA_PASS_THROUGH</a> completes, the port driver updates <b>CurrentTaskFile</b> with the values that are present in the device's output registers at the completion of the embedded command. The array values in <b>CurrentTaskFile</b> correspond to the following task file output registers.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Byte</th>
<th>Output Register</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
0

</td>
<td>
Error register

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
1

</td>
<td>
Sector count register

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
2

</td>
<td>
Sector number register

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
3

</td>
<td>
Cylinder low register

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
4

</td>
<td>
Cylinder high register

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
5

</td>
<td>
Device/head register

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
6

</td>
<td>
Status register

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
7

</td>
<td>
Reserved

</td>
</tr>
</table>
        
            `DataBufferOffset`

            Specifies the offset, in bytes, from the beginning of this structure to the data buffer.
        
            `DataTransferLength`

            Indicates the size, in bytes, of the data buffer. If an underrun occurs, the miniport driver must update this member to the number of bytes that were actually transferred.
        
            `Length`

            Specifies the length in bytes of the ATA_PASS_THROUGH_EX structure.
        
            `Lun`

            Indicates the logical unit number of the device. This value is set by the port driver.
        
            `PathId`

            Contains an integer that indicates the IDE port or bus for the request. This value is set by the port driver.
        
            `PreviousTaskFile`

            Specifies the contents of the task file input registers prior to the current pass-through command. This member is not used when the ATA_FLAGS_48BIT_COMMAND flag is not set.
        
            `ReservedAsUchar`

            Reserved for future use.
        
            `ReservedAsUlong`

            Reserved for future use.
        
            `TargetId`

            Contains an integer that indicates the target device on the bus. This value is set by the port driver.
        
            `TimeOutValue`

            Indicates the number of seconds that are allowed for the request to execute before the OS-specific port driver determines that the request has timed out.

    ## Remarks
        <a href="..\ntddscsi\ni-ntddscsi-ioctl_ata_pass_through.md">IOCTL_ATA_PASS_THROUGH</a> is a buffered device control request. To bypass buffering in system memory, callers should use <a href="..\ntddscsi\ni-ntddscsi-ioctl_ata_pass_through_direct.md">IOCTL_ATA_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT</a> and <a href="..\ntddscsi\ns-ntddscsi-_ata_pass_through_direct.md">ATA_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT</a>. When handling an IOCTL_ATA_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT request, the system locks down the buffer in user memory and the device accesses this memory directly.

## Requirements
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows Driver kit version** |  |
| **Minimum KMDF version** |  |
| **Minimum UMDF version** |  |
| **Header** | ntddscsi.h (include Ntddscsi.h) |
