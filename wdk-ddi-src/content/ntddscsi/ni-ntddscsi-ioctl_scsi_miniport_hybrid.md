# IOCTL_SCSI_MINIPORT_HYBRID IOCTL



## -description
The 
     <b>IOCTL_SCSI_MINIPORT_HYBRID</b> control code sends a hybrid disk control request to an HBA-specific miniport driver. The <b>IOCTL_SCSI_MINIPORT_HYBRID</b> request is a sub-IOCTL of <a href="..\ntddscsi\ni-ntddscsi-ioctl_scsi_miniport.md">IOCTL_SCSI_MINIPORT</a>. This IOCTL is received and reformatted by StorPort, then sent  to the miniport as a <a href="storage.storage_request_block">STORAGE_REQUEST_BLOCK</a> (SRB) with a function type of SRB_FUNCTION_IO_CONTROL. The input and output data is contained in the SRB data block. 

<b>IOCTL_SCSI_MINIPORT_HYBRID</b> is intended for use by third-party applications or filter drives which manage security features such as encryption or write-through behavior. 



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _HYBRID_REQUEST_BLOCK {
    ULONG   Version;
    ULONG   Size;
    ULONG   Function;
    ULONG   Flags;
    ULONG   DataBufferOffset;
    ULONG   DataBufferLength;
} HYBRID_REQUEST_BLOCK, *PHYBRID_REQUEST_BLOCK;
````


## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
The buffer specified in the <b>DataBuffer</b> member of the SRB must contain an <a href="storage.srb_io_control">SRB_IO_CONTROL</a> structure and a <b>HYBRID_REQUEST_BLOCK</b> structure. Depending on the <b>Function</b> member of <b>HYBRID_REQUEST_BLOCK</b>, additional data can be supplied. 


### -input-buffer-length
<b>DataTransferLength</b> indicates the size, in bytes, of the buffer, which must be at least <b>sizeof</b> (SRB_IO_CONTROL) + <b>sizeof</b>(HYBRID_REQUEST_BLOCK), with additional storage for function data if the <b>DataBufferLength</b> member of the <b>HYBRID_REQUEST_BLOCK</b> is nonzero.


### -output-buffer
An updated <a href="storage.srb_io_control">SRB_IO_CONTROL</a> structure is returned to the data buffer in the SRB. 


### -output-buffer-length
The <b>DataBufferOffset</b> and <b>DataBufferLength</b> members of <b>HYBRID_REQUEST_BLOCK</b> are nonzero when data is returned for the specified <b>Function</b>. The <b>DataTransferLength</b> member of the SRB is updated when data is returned for the request function.


### -in-out-buffer

<text></text>

### -inout-buffer-length

<text></text>

### -status-block
I/O Status block
The resulting status of the function request is set in the <b>ReturnCode</b> member of <a href="storage.srb_io_control">SRB_IO_CONTROL</a>. The following are the hybrid disk IOCTL status codes.

 


## -remarks
A <b>HYBRID_REQUEST_BLOCK</b> structure immediately follows the <a href="storage.srb_io_control">SRB_IO_CONTROL</a> structure in the data buffer.  <b>HYBRID_REQUEST_BLOCK</b> is defined in ntddscsi.h as the following.



The version of the structure. Set to HYBRID_REQUEST_BLOCK_STRUCTURE_VERSION.

The size of the structure. Set to <b>sizeof</b>(HYBRID_REQUEST_BLOCK).

The hybrid disk request function. The function code is one of the following.

Returns information about the capabilities and attributes of a hybrid devices, such as supported priority levels, command set support, and cache size in a <a href="storage.hybrid_information">HYBRID_INFORMATION</a> structure. On input, the <b>DataBuffer</b> specified in the SRB must contain the <a href="storage.srb_io_control">SRB_IO_CONTROL</a> and <b>HYBRID_REQUEST_BLOCK</b> structures. The <b>DataBufferLength</b> must be large enough to include the <b>HYBRID_INFORMATION</b> structure returned. The <b>DataBufferOffset</b> points to the output data containing <b>HYBRID_INFORMATION</b>. If  the buffer is too small to return the data,  the <b>ReturnCode</b> member of <b>SRB_IO_CONTROL</b> is set to HYBRID_STATUS_OUTPUT_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL and <b>DataBufferLength</b> of the <b>HYBRID_REQUEST_BLOCK</b> is set to indicate the required length.

Disables the hybrid cache. Disabling the cache  can take several minutes. If queried during this operation, the <b>NV_CACHE_STATUS</b> member of the <a href="storage.hybrid_information">HYBRID_INFORMATION</a> structure is set to <b>NvCacheStatusDisabling</b> until the cache is completely disabled. The caller should check the status of <b>NV_CACHE_STATUS</b> to verify that the caching medium is disabled. Once the cache is fully disabled, the status is <b>NvCacheStatusDisabled</b>. For this function, the <b>DataBufferOffset</b> member of <b>HYBRID_REQUEST_BLOCK</b> is set 0. This function has no output parameters.

Sets the caching medium to its default state, which is “enabled”. The <b>DataBufferOffset</b> member of <b>HYBRID_REQUEST_BLOCK</b> is set to 0. When this function completes, when queried, the <b>NV_CACHE_STATUS</b> member of the <a href="storage.hybrid_information">HYBRID_INFORMATION</a> structure is set to <b>NvCacheStatusEnabled</b>. For this function, the <b>DataBufferOffset</b> member of <b>HYBRID_REQUEST_BLOCK</b> is set 0. This function has no output parameters.

Sets the thresholds for dirty data synchronization on the device. In addition to <a href="storage.srb_io_control">SRB_IO_CONTROL</a> and <b>HYBRID_REQUEST_BLOCK</b>, this function requires a <b>HYBRID_DIRTY_THRESHOLDS</b> structure included as input. The <b>DataBufferOffset</b> member is set to the beginning of the <b>HYBRID_DIRTY_THRESHOLDS</b> structure. This function has no output parameters.

This function demotes the priority of a given amount of cache contents to a lower priority. It can be used to achieve a soft reset of the cache by demoting all cache contents to priority 0. In addition to <a href="storage.srb_io_control">SRB_IO_CONTROL</a> and <b>HYBRID_REQUEST_BLOCK</b>, this function requires a <b>HYBRID_DEMOTE_BY_SIZE</b> structure included as input. The <b>DataBufferOffset</b> member is set to the beginning of the <b>HYBRID_DEMOTE_BY_SIZE</b> structure. This function has no output parameters.

Reserved. Set to 0.

The offset for additional data that was sent or is returned for the function specified in  <b>Function</b>. This value varies on the data required for <b>Function</b>.  This value is the offset from the beginning the <b>DataBuffer</b> of the SRB which contains a <a href="storage.srb_io_control">SRB_IO_CONTROL</a> structure and other required data structures. It should point to the first location after <b>SRB_IO_CONTROL</b> and <b>HYBRID_REQUEST_BLOCK</b>. This value is aligned at a multiple of <b>sizeof</b>(PVOID). If there is no buffer then <b>DataBufferOffset</b> is set to 0.

The size the data block found at <b>DataBufferOffset</b>.

The parameter requirements depend on the function code of the hybrid disk request. The following table lists the parameters required for each function.


<a href="storage.srb_io_control">SRB_IO_CONTROL</a> +

<b>HYBRID_REQUEST_BLOCK</b>

<b>HYBRID_REQUEST_BLOCK</b> +


<a href="storage.hybrid_information">HYBRID_INFORMATION</a>



<a href="storage.srb_io_control">SRB_IO_CONTROL</a>


<b>HYBRID_DIRTY_THRESHOLDS</b>

<b>HYBRID_DEMOTE_BY_SIZE</b>

The <b>HYBRID_REQUEST_BLOCK</b> structure is located after the <a href="storage.srb_io_control">SRB_IO_CONTROL</a> structure in the <b>DataBuffer</b> of the SRB. Any function data included with the request is found at the offset in <b>DataBufferOffset</b> after the beginning of the <b>SRB_IO_CONTROL</b> structure.

The following example demonstrates retrieval of  the function data for a HYBRID_FUNCTION_SET_DIRTY_THRESHOLD request.

The HYBRID_FUNCTION_SET_DIRTY_THRESHOLD function uses the <b>HYBRID_DIRTY_THRESHOLDS</b> structure for its input parameters. <b>HYBRID_DIRTY_THRESHOLDS</b> is defined in ntddscsi.h as the following.<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
