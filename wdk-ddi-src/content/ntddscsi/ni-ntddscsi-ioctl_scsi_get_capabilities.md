# IOCTL_SCSI_GET_CAPABILITIES IOCTL



## -description

Returns the capabilities and limitations of the underlying SCSI HBA. The most important information is returned in the <b>MaximumTransferLength</b> and <b>AlignmentMask </b>members. Class drivers and users of <a href="..\ntddscsi\ni-ntddscsi-ioctl_scsi_pass_through.md">IOCTL_SCSI_PASS_THROUGH</a> and <a href="..\ntddscsi\ni-ntddscsi-ioctl_scsi_pass_through_direct.md">IOCTL_SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT</a> are required to honor these limitations.

Only legacy drivers can issue this request. The request fails if it is sent to a PDO created by the port driver. 

To get SCSI capabilities data, a Plug and Play driver must issue an <a href="..\ntddstor\ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_query_property.md">IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY</a> request for <a href="storage.storage_adapter_descriptor">STORAGE_ADAPTER_DESCRIPTOR</a> data to the PDO for each device to which the driver has been added (that is, each device for which the driver has received an <i>AddDevice </i>call). A legacy driver should forward this request to the port driver. This request fails if it is sent to the FDO for an adapter.

## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
None.


### -input-buffer-length
None.


### -output-buffer
Updated <a href="storage.io_scsi_capabilities">IO_SCSI_CAPABILITIES</a> information is returned to the buffer at <b>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b>.


### -output-buffer-length
<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.OutputBufferLength</b> in the I/O stack location indicates the size, in bytes, of the buffer, which must be &gt;= <b>sizeof</b>(IO_SCSI_CAPABILITIES).


### -in-out-buffer

<text></text>

### -inout-buffer-length

<text></text>

### -status-block
I/O Status block
The <b>Information</b> field contains the number of bytes returned in the output buffer. The <b>Status</b> field indicates the results of the operation.
