# IOCTL_ATA_PASS_THROUGH IOCTL



## -description

Allows an application to send almost any ATA command to a target device, with the following restrictions: 
<ul>
<li>
If a class driver for the target type of device exists, the application must send the request to the class driver. Thus, an application can send this request directly to the system port driver for a target logical unit (LU) only if there is no class driver for the type of device connected to that LU. The system port driver does not check to determine if a device has been claimed by a class driver before processing a pass-through request. Therefore, if an application bypasses a class driver that has claimed a device and sends a pass-through request for that device directly to the port driver, a conflict for control of the device can occur between the class driver and the application. 
</li>
<li>
This request cannot be used if the command requires the underlying driver to access memory directly. If the caller's command might require direct access to memory, use <a href="..\ntddscsi\ni-ntddscsi-ioctl_ata_pass_through_direct.md">IOCTL_ATA_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT</a> instead. 
</li>
<li>
Applications must not attempt to send a pass-through request asynchronously. All pass-through requests must be synchronous. 
</li>
<li>
Applications do not require administrative privileges to send a pass-through request to a device, but they must have read/write access to the device. 
</li>
</ul>
The calling application provides the ATA task file register contents for the intended command in the <a href="storage.ata_pass_through_ex">ATA_PASS_THROUGH_EX</a> structure. The system double buffers all data transfers. This request is typically used for transferring small amounts of data (less than 16 KB).

If the embedded ATA command is a read operation or a device control operation that does not involve data transfer, <b>InputBufferLength</b> should be equal to <b>sizeof</b> (ATA_PASS_THROUGH_EX). If the embedded ATA command is a read operation or a device control operation that does not involve data transfer, <b>InputBufferLength</b>InputBufferLength should be equal to <b>sizeof</b>sizeof (ATA_PASS_THROUGH_EX). 
In either case, if <b>InputBufferLength</b> is less than <b>sizeof</b> (ATA_PASS_THROUGH_EX), the port driver fails the I/O request and returns an error.In either case, if <b>InputBufferLength</b>InputBufferLength is less than <b>sizeof</b>sizeof (ATA_PASS_THROUGH_EX), the port driver fails the I/O request and returns an error.
The buffer at <b>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> should contain an <a href="storage.ata_pass_through_ex">ATA_PASS_THROUGH_EX</a> structure, which includes a set of task file input registers that indicate the sort of command to be performed and its parameters. The caller must initialize all the members of this structure except for <b>PathId</b>, <b>TargetId</b>, and <b>Lun</b>, which the port driver fills in. For a data-out command, the <b>DataBufferOffset</b> member of the structure must point to a cache-aligned buffer containing the data to be written.
