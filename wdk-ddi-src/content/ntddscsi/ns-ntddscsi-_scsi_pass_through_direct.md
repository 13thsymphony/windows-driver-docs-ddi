# _SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT structure
The <b>SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT</b> structure is used in conjunction with an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560521">IOCTL_SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT</a> request to instruct the port driver to send an embedded SCSI command to the target device. 
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The SCSI port driver and SCSI miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## Syntax
```
typedef struct _SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT {
  USHORT Length;
  UCHAR  ScsiStatus;
  UCHAR  PathId;
  UCHAR  TargetId;
  UCHAR  Lun;
  UCHAR  CdbLength;
  UCHAR  SenseInfoLength;
  UCHAR  DataIn;
  ULONG  DataTransferLength;
  ULONG  TimeOutValue;
  PVOID  DataBuffer;
  ULONG  SenseInfoOffset;
  UCHAR  Cdb[16];
} SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT, *PSCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT;
```

## Members


`Length`

Contains the value of <b>sizeof</b>(SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT).

`ScsiStatus`

Reports the SCSI status that was returned by the HBA or the target device.

`PathId`

Indicates the SCSI port or bus for the request.

`TargetId`

Indicates the target controller or device on the bus.

`Lun`

Indicates the logical unit number of the device.

`CdbLength`

Indicates the size in bytes of the SCSI command descriptor block.

`SenseInfoLength`

Indicates the size in bytes of the request-sense buffer.

`DataIn`

#####  This field must have one of three values:



#######

`DataTransferLength`

Indicates the size in bytes of the data buffer. Many devices transfer chunks of data of predefined length. The value in <b>DataTransferLength</b> must be an integral multiple of this predefined, minimum length that is specified by the device. If an underrun occurs, the miniport driver must update this member to the number of bytes actually transferred.

`TimeOutValue`

Indicates the interval in seconds that the request can execute before the OS-specific port driver might consider it timed out.

`DataBuffer`

Pointer to the data buffer.

`SenseInfoOffset`

Contains an offset from the beginning of this structure to the request-sense buffer.

`Cdb`

Specifies the SCSI command descriptor block to be sent to the target device.

## Remarks
The SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT structure is used with <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560521">IOCTL_SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT</a>. With this request, the system locks down the buffer in user memory and the device accesses this memory directly. For a double-buffered equivalent of this device control request see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560519">IOCTL_SCSI_PASS_THROUGH</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565345">SCSI_PASS_THROUGH</a>.

The members of SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT correspond roughly to the members of a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565393">SCSI_REQUEST_BLOCK</a> structure. The values of the <b>DataIn</b> member correspond to the SCSI_IOCTL_DATA_IN, SCSI_IOCTL_DATA_OUT, and SCSI_IOCTL_DATA_UNSPECIFIED flags assigned to <b>SrbFlags</b> member of SCSI_REQUEST_BLOCK.
