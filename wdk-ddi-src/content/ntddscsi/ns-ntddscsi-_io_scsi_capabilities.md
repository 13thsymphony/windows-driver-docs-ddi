# _IO_SCSI_CAPABILITIES structure
The IO_SCSI_CAPABILITIES structure is used in conjunction with the <a href="..\ntddscsi\ni-ntddscsi-ioctl_scsi_get_capabilities.md">IOCTL_SCSI_GET_CAPABILITIES</a> request to retrieve the capabilities and limitations of the underlying SCSI host adapter.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The SCSI port driver and SCSI miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _IO_SCSI_CAPABILITIES {
  ULONG   Length;
  ULONG   MaximumTransferLength;
  ULONG   MaximumPhysicalPages;
  ULONG   SupportedAsynchronousEvents;

## Members


`AdapterScansDown`

When <b>TRUE</b>, indicates that the host adapter scans down for BIOS devices.

`AdapterUsesPio`

When <b>TRUE</b>, indicates that the host adapter uses programmed I/O.

`AlignmentMask`

Contains the alignment mask for data transfers. The host adapter requires that data to be transferred must be aligned on an address that is an integer multiple of the value in this field.

`Length`

Contains the length in bytes of this structure.

`MaximumPhysicalPages`

Contains the maximum number of physical pages per data buffer.

`MaximumTransferLength`

Contains the maximum size, in bytes, of a single SCSI request block (SRB).

`SupportedAsynchronousEvents`

When <b>TRUE</b>, indicates that the host adapter supports SCSI asynchronous receive-event operations.

`TaggedQueuing`

When <b>TRUE</b>, indicates that the host adapter supports tagged queuing.
