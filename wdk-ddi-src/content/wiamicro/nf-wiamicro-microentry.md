# MicroEntry function
The<b> MicroEntry </b>function responds to commands sent by the WIA Flatbed driver.

## Syntax

````
WIAMICRO_API HRESULT MicroEntry(
          LONG lCommand,
  _Inout_ PVAL pValue
);
````

## Parameters

`lCommand`

Specifies a command issued to the microdriver by the WIA Flatbed driver.

`pValue`

Points to a <a href="..\wiamicro\ns-wiamicro-val.md">VAL</a> structure that is used to pass information between the WIA Flatbed driver and the microdriver.


## Return Value

If the function succeeds, it returns S_OK. If a passed command is not supported,  the function returns E_NOTIMPL. For any error, error information must be put in the <b>lVal</b> member of the VAL structure pointed to by <i>pValue</i>.

## Remarks

This function performs many different tasks, depending on the command passed in the <i>lCommand</i> parameter. See the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552714">WIA Microdriver Commands</a> reference section for a list of these commands.

Two structures are passed to the function. A <a href="..\wiamicro\ns-wiamicro-val.md">VAL</a> structure is passed in the <i>pValue</i> pointer, and the <b>pScanInfo</b> member of the VAL structure points to a <a href="..\wiamicro\ns-wiamicro-_scaninfo.md">SCANINFO</a> structure. The VAL structure is used to pass information between the WIA Flatbed Driver and the microdriver. The SCANINFO structure is used to store and communicate parameters of a scan data acquisition. Many of the commands passed to this function set values in the SCANINFO structure.
