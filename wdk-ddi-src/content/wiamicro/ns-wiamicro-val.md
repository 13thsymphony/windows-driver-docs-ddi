# VAL structure
The VAL structure is used by the microdriver and WIA Flatbed driver to pass information between each other.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct VAL {
  LONG      lVal;
  double    dblVal;
  GUID      *pGuid;
  PSCANINFO pScanInfo;
  HGLOBAL   handle;
  WCHAR     **ppButtonNames;
  HANDLE    *pHandle;
  LONG      lReserved;
  CHAR      szVal[MAX_ANSI_CHAR];
} *PVAL, VAL;
```

## Members


`lVal`

Specifies a command value to return to the WIA Flatbed driver. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552714">WIA Microdriver Commands</a> for a list of available commands for this parameter.

`dblVal`

Specifies a command value to return to the WIA Flatbed driver. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552714">WIA Microdriver Commands</a> for a list of available commands for this parameter.

`pGuid`

Points to the GUID of the pressed button. If no button was pressed, this member points to GUID_NULL.

`pScanInfo`

Points to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547361">SCANINFO</a> structure.

`handle`

Points to a ShutDown event handle that will be signaled by the WIA Flatbed Driver when the driver is being unloaded or shut down.

`ppButtonNames`

Specifies the address of a pointer to an array of button names.

`pHandle`

Points to an event handle.

`lReserved`

Reserved. Do not use.

`szVal`

Specifies the device name in ASCII form. If needed for interrupt checking, the microdriver can use this name to pass to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/80a96083-4de9-4422-9705-b8ad2b6cbd1b">CreateFile</a> (described in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation) in order to obtain a file handle to the device.
