# UcmTcpciDeviceInitInitialize function
Initializes device initialization operations when the Plug and Play (PnP) manager reports the existence of a device.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS UcmTcpciDeviceInitInitialize(
  _In_ PWDFDEVICE_INIT DeviceInit
);
````

## Parameters

`DeviceInit`

A pointer to a framework-allocated <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546951">WDFDEVICE_INIT</a> structure.


## Return Value

(NTSTATUS) The method returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this method may return an appropriate <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7792201b-63bb-4db5-803d-2af02893d505">NTSTATUS</a> error code.

## Remarks

The client driver calls this method after it has performed all of its own initialization in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546951">WDFDEVICE_INIT</a> structure, just before it calls <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicecreate.md">WdfDeviceCreate</a>.
