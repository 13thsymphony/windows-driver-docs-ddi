## -struct-fields

### -field ProcessorCorrectable

A single bit that indicates that a correctable processor error can be injected into the hardware platform.


### -field ProcessorUncorrectableNonFatal

A single bit that indicates that an uncorrectable nonfatal processor error can be injected into the hardware platform.


### -field ProcessorUncorrectableFatal

A single bit that indicates that an uncorrectable fatal processor error can be injected into the hardware platform.


### -field MemoryCorrectable

A single bit that indicates that a correctable memory error can be injected into the hardware platform.


### -field MemoryUncorrectableNonFatal

A single bit that indicates that an uncorrectable nonfatal memory error can be injected into the hardware platform.


### -field MemoryUncorrectableFatal

A single bit that indicates that an uncorrectable fatal memory error can be injected into the hardware platform.


### -field PCIExpressCorrectable

A single bit that indicates that a correctable PCI Express (PCIe) error can be injected into the hardware platform.


### -field PCIExpressUncorrectableNonFatal

A single bit that indicates that an uncorrectable nonfatal PCI Express (PCIe) error can be injected into the hardware platform.


### -field PCIExpressUncorrectableFatal

A single bit that indicates that an uncorrectable fatal PCI Express (PCIe) error can be injected into the hardware platform.


### -field PlatformCorrectable

A single bit that indicates that a correctable platform error can be injected into the hardware platform.


### -field PlatformUncorrectableNonFatal

A single bit that indicates that an uncorrectable nonfatal platform error can be injected into the hardware platform.


### -field PlatformUncorrectableFatal

A single bit that indicates that an uncorrectable fatal platform error can be injected into the hardware platform.


### -field IA64Corrected

A single bit that indicates that a corrected IA64 error can be injected into the hardware platform.


### -field IA64Recoverable

A single bit that indicates that a recoverable IA64 error can be injected into the hardware platform.


### -field IA64Fatal

A single bit that indicates that a fatal IA64 error can be injected into the hardware platform.


### -field IA64RecoverableCache

A single bit that indicates that a recoverable IA64 cache error can be injected into the hardware platform.


### -field IA64RecoverableRegFile

A single bit that indicates that a recoverable IA64 register file error can be injected into the hardware platform.


### -field Reserved

Reserved for system use.


### -field AsULONG

A ULONG representation of the contents of the WHEA_ERROR_INJECTION_CAPABILITIES union.


## -remarks
A user-mode WHEA management application calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559516">WHEAErrorInjectionMethods::GetErrorInjectionCapabilitiesRtn</a> method to retrieve a WHEA_ERROR_INJECTION_CAPABILITIES union that describes the types of hardware errors that can be injected into the hardware platform. If a PSHED plug-in is registered to participate in error injection, the PSHED plug-in's <a href="..\ntddk\nc-ntddk-pshed_pi_get_injection_capabilities.md">GetInjectionCapabilities</a> callback function is called to provide this information back to the calling application. The application uses this information when it calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559518">WHEAErrorInjectionMethods::InjectErrorRtn</a> method to inject a hardware error into the hardware platform.
