# _PCI_EXPRESS_ROOT_CONTROL_REGISTER structure



## -description
The PCI_EXPRESS_ROOT_CONTROL_REGISTER structure describes a PCI Express (PCIe) root control register of a PCIe capability structure.



## -syntax

````
typedef union _PCI_EXPRESS_ROOT_CONTROL_REGISTER {
  struct {
    USHORT CorrectableSerrEnable  :1;
    USHORT NonFatalSerrEnable  :1;
    USHORT FatalSerrEnable  :1;
    USHORT PMEInterruptEnable  :1;
    USHORT CRSSoftwareVisibilityEnable  :1;
    USHORT Rsvd  :11;
  };
  USHORT AsUSHORT;
} PCI_EXPRESS_ROOT_CONTROL_REGISTER, *PPCI_EXPRESS_ROOT_CONTROL_REGISTER;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field CorrectableSerrEnable

A single bit that indicates that a system error should be generated if a correctable error is reported by any of the devices in the hierarchy that are associated with this root port or by the root port itself.


### -field NonFatalSerrEnable

A single bit that indicates that a system error should be generated if a non-fatal error is reported by any of the devices in the hierarchy that are associated with this root port or by the root port itself.


### -field FatalSerrEnable

A single bit that indicates that a system error should be generated if a non-fatal error is reported by any of the devices in the hierarchy that are associated with this root port or by the root port itself.


### -field PMEInterruptEnable

A single bit that indicates that interrupts are enabled for power management events.


### -field CRSSoftwareVisibilityEnable

A single bit that indicates that the root port is enabled to return configuration request retry status (CRS) completion status to software.


### -field Rsvd

Reserved.


### -field AsUSHORT

A USHORT representation of the contents of the PCI_EXPRESS_ROOT_CONTROL_REGISTER structure.


## -remarks
The PCI_EXPRESS_ROOT_CONTROL_REGISTER structure is available in Windows Server 2008 and later versions of Windows.

A PCI_EXPRESS_ROOT_CONTROL_REGISTER structure is contained in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537460">PCI_EXPRESS_CAPABILITY</a> structure.
