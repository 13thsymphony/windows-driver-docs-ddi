# _FILE_DISPOSITION_INFORMATION structure
The <b>FILE_DISPOSITION_INFORMATION</b> structure is used as an argument to the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-zwsetinformationfile.md">ZwSetInformationFile</a> routine.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _FILE_DISPOSITION_INFORMATION {
  BOOLEAN DeleteFile;
} FILE_DISPOSITION_INFORMATION, *PFILE_DISPOSITION_INFORMATION;
````

## Members


`DeleteFile`

Indicates whether the operating system file should delete the file when the file is closed. Set this member to <b>TRUE</b> to delete the file when it is closed. Otherwise, set to <b>FALSE</b>. Setting this member to <b>FALSE</b> has no effect if the handle was opened with FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE.

## Remarks
The caller must have DELETE access to a given file in order to call <b>ZwSetInformationFile</b> with <b>DeleteFile</b> set to <b>TRUE</b> in this structure. Subsequently, the only legal operation by such a caller is to close the open file handle. 

A file marked for deletion is not actually deleted until all open handles for the file object have been closed and the link count for the file is zero.
