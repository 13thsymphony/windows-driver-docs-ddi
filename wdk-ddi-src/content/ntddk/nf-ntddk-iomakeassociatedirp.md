# IoMakeAssociatedIrp function
This routine is reserved for use by file systems and file system filter drivers. The <b>IoMakeAssociatedIrp</b> routine allocates and initializes an IRP to be associated with a master IRP sent to a highest-level driver, allowing the caller to split the original request and send associated IRPs on to lower-level drivers.

## Syntax

````
PIRP IoMakeAssociatedIrp(
  _In_ PIRP  Irp,
  _In_ CCHAR StackSize
);
````

## Parameters

`Irp`

Pointer to the master IRP that was input to a highest-level driver's Dispatch routine.

`StackSize`

Specifies the number of stack locations to be allocated for the associated IRP. The value must be at least equal to the <i>StackSize</i> of the next-lower driver's device object, but the associated IRP can have an additional stack location for the caller.


## Return Value

<b>IoMakeAssociatedIrp</b> returns a pointer to the associated IRP or returns a <b>NULL</b> pointer if an IRP cannot be allocated.

## Remarks

Only a highest-level driver can call this routine.

The I/O manager completes the master IRP automatically when lower drivers have completed all associated IRPs as long as the caller has not set its <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-io_completion_routine.md">IoCompletion</a> routine in an associated IRP and returned STATUS_MORE_PROCESSING_REQUIRED from its <i>IoCompletion</i> routine. In these circumstances, the caller must explicitly complete the master IRP when that driver has determined that all associated IRPs were completed.

Only the master IRP is associated with a thread; associated IRPs are not. For this reason, the I/O manager cannot call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh406716">Cancel</a> routines for associated IRPs when a thread exits. When the master IRP's thread exits, the I/O manager calls the master IRP's <i>Cancel</i> routine. The <i>Cancel</i> routine is responsible for tracking down all associated IRPs and calling <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iocancelirp.md">IoCancelIrp</a> to cancel them.
