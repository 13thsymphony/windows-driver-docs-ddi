# _WHEA_GENERIC_ERROR structure
The WHEA_GENERIC_ERROR structure describes error status data for a generic error source.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _WHEA_GENERIC_ERROR {
  WHEA_GENERIC_ERROR_BLOCKSTATUS BlockStatus;
  ULONG                          RawDataOffset;
  ULONG                          RawDataLength;
  ULONG                          DataLength;
  WHEA_ERROR_SEVERITY            ErrorSeverity;
  UCHAR                          Data[1];
} WHEA_GENERIC_ERROR, *PWHEA_GENERIC_ERROR;
````

## Members


`BlockStatus`

A <a href="..\ntddk\ns-ntddk-_whea_generic_error_blockstatus.md">WHEA_GENERIC_ERROR_BLOCKSTATUS</a> union that indicates what kind of error data is reported in the generic error status block.

`Data`

A variable-sized buffer that contains the error data from the generic error source. This buffer contains the generic error status block followed by the raw error data.

`DataLength`

The size, in bytes, of the error data contained in the <b>Data</b> member.

`ErrorSeverity`

A <a href="..\ntddk\ne-ntddk-_whea_error_severity.md">WHEA_ERROR_SEVERITY</a>-typed value that indicates the severity of the error condition.

`RawDataLength`

The length, in bytes, of the raw error data that is located at the offset specified in the <b>RawDataOffset</b> member.

`RawDataOffset`

The offset, in bytes, from the beginning of the WHEA_GENERIC_ERROR structure to the beginning of the raw error data.

## Remarks
A generic error source is described by a <a href="..\ntddk\ns-ntddk-_whea_generic_error_descriptor.md">WHEA_GENERIC_ERROR_DESCRIPTOR</a> structure. The <b>ErrStatusAddress</b> member of the WHEA_GENERIC_ERROR_DESCRIPTOR structure points to a register that contains the physical address of a WHEA_GENERIC_ERROR structure in firmware reserved memory. This WHEA_GENERIC_ERROR structure contains the error status data for the generic error source.

A WHEA_GENERIC_ERROR structure is included in the <b>RawData</b> member of a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560465">WHEA_ERROR_PACKET</a> structure whenever the <b>RawDataFormat </b>member of the WHEA_ERROR_PACKET structure contains <b>WheaRawDataFormatGeneric</b>.
