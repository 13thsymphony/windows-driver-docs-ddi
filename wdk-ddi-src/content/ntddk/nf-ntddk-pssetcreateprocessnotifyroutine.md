# PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine function



## -description
The <b>PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine</b> routine adds a driver-supplied callback routine to, or removes it from, a list of routines to be called whenever a process is created or deleted.



## -syntax

````
NTSTATUS PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine(
  _In_ PCREATE_PROCESS_NOTIFY_ROUTINE NotifyRoutine,
  _In_ BOOLEAN                        Remove
);
````


## -parameters

### -param NotifyRoutine [in]

Specifies the entry point of a caller-supplied process-creation callback routine. See <a href="..\ntddk\nc-ntddk-pcreate_process_notify_routine.md">PCREATE_PROCESS_NOTIFY_ROUTINE</a>.


### -param Remove [in]

Indicates whether the routine specified by <i>NotifyRoutine</i> should be added to or removed from the system's list of notification routines. If <b>FALSE</b>, the specified routine is added to the list. If <b>TRUE</b>, the specified routine is removed from the list.


## -returns
<b>PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine</b> can return one of the following:
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>The given <i>NotifyRoutine</i> is now registered with the system.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</b></dt>
</dl>The given <i>NotifyRoutine</i> has already been registered, so this call is a redundant call, or the system has reached its limit for registering process-creation callbacks. 

 


## -remarks
Highest-level drivers can call <b>PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine</b> to set up their process-creation notify routines implemented as <a href="..\ntddk\nc-ntddk-pcreate_process_notify_routine.md">PCREATE_PROCESS_NOTIFY_ROUTINE</a>.

An IFS or highest-level system-profiling driver might register a process-creation callback to track the system-wide creation and deletion of processes against the driver's internal state. For Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, the system can register up to 64 process-creation callback routines.

A driver must remove any callbacks that it registers before it unloads. You can remove the callback by calling <b>PsSetCreateProcessNotify</b> with <i>Remove</i> = <b>TRUE</b>.

After a driver-supplied routine is registered, it is called with <i>Create</i> set to <b>TRUE</b> just after the initial thread is created within the newly created process designated by the input <i>ProcessId</i> handle. The input <i>ParentId</i> handle identifies the parent process of the newly-created process (this is the parent used for priority, affinity, quota, token, and handle inheritance, among others).
