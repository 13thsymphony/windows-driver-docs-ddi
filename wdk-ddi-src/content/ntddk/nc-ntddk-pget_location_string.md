# PGET_LOCATION_STRING callback function
The <i>PnpGetLocationString</i> routine provides the device-specific part of the device's SPDRP_LOCATION_PATHS property.

## Syntax

```
PGET_LOCATION_STRING PgetLocationString;

NTSTATUS PgetLocationString(
  PVOID Context,
  PZZWSTR *LocationStrings
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Context`

A pointer to interface-specific context information.  The caller passes the value that is passed as the <b>Context</b> member of the <a href="..\ntddk\ns-ntddk-_pnp_location_interface.md">PNP_LOCATION_INTERFACE</a> structure.

`*LocationStrings`




## Return Value

The routine returns an NTSTATUS value to indicate the status of the operation.

## Remarks

The <a href="..\ntddk\ns-ntddk-_pnp_location_interface.md">PNP_LOCATION_INTERFACE</a> structure supplies a pointer to the <i>PnpGetLocationString</i> routine.

The <i>PnpGetLocationString</i> routine provides the device-specific part of the location string for the device.  The Plug and Play (PnP) manager assembles the location string for a device by querying the driver for the device, for the device's bus, and any parent buses, and concatenating the provided strings together.

The routine must return a string that is unique to the device relative to its bus. The string must be the same for the device across all versions of the operating system. Once you select a string for this purpose, you must not change it.

By convention, the location string takes the form <i>ServiceName(BusSpecificLocation)</i>. For example, PCI devices use PCI(<i>XXYY</i>), where <i>XX</i> is the device number, and <i>YY</i> is the function number.

The <i>PnpGetLocationString</i> routine calls a routine such as <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exallocatepoolwithtag.md">ExAllocatePoolWithTag</a> to allocate the memory for the location string. The caller is responsible for calling the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exfreepool.md">ExFreePool</a> routine to free the memory pointed to by <i>LocationStrings</i> when the location string is no longer needed.
