# _WHEA_XPF_CMC_DESCRIPTOR structure
The WHEA_XPF_CMC_DESCRIPTOR structure describes a corrected machine check (CMC) error source for an x86 or x64 processor.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _WHEA_XPF_CMC_DESCRIPTOR {
  USHORT                       Type;
  BOOLEAN                      Enabled;
  UCHAR                        NumberOfBanks;
  ULONG                        Reserved;
  WHEA_NOTIFICATION_DESCRIPTOR Notify;
  WHEA_XPF_MC_BANK_DESCRIPTOR  Banks[WHEA_MAX_MC_BANKS];
} WHEA_XPF_CMC_DESCRIPTOR, *PWHEA_XPF_CMC_DESCRIPTOR;
````

## Members


`Banks`

An array of <a href="..\ntddk\ns-ntddk-_whea_xpf_mc_bank_descriptor.md">WHEA_XPF_MC_BANK_DESCRIPTOR</a> structures that describe the banks of machine check registers.

`Enabled`

A Boolean value that indicates if the error source is enabled.

`Notify`

A <a href="..\ntddk\ns-ntddk-_whea_notification_descriptor.md">WHEA_NOTIFICATION_DESCRIPTOR</a> structure that describes the notification mechanism that is used by the error source.

`NumberOfBanks`

The number of <a href="..\ntddk\ns-ntddk-_whea_xpf_mc_bank_descriptor.md">WHEA_XPF_MC_BANK_DESCRIPTOR</a> structures contained in the <b>Banks</b> member.

`Reserved`

Reserved for system use.

`Type`

The type of error source descriptor. This member is always set to WHEA_ERROR_SOURCE_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_XPFCMC.

## Remarks
A WHEA_XPF_CMC_DESCRIPTOR structure is contained within the <a href="..\ntddk\ns-ntddk-_whea_error_source_descriptor.md">WHEA_ERROR_SOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</a> structure.
