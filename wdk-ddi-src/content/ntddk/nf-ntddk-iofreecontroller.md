# IoFreeController function



## -description
The <b>IoFreeController</b> routine releases a previously allocated controller object when the driver has completed an I/O request.



## -syntax

````
VOID IoFreeController(
  _In_ PCONTROLLER_OBJECT ControllerObject
);
````


## -parameters

### -param ControllerObject [in]

Pointer to the driver's controller object, which was allocated for the current I/O operation on a particular device by calling <b>IoAllocateController</b>. 


## -returns
None


## -remarks
The connection between the current target device object and the controller object is released only if no requests are currently queued to the same device. Otherwise, the driver's ControllerControl routine is called with the next IRP bound through the device controller to the target device.
