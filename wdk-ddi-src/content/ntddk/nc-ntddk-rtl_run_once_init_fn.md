# RTL_RUN_ONCE_INIT_FN function
The <i>RunOnceInitialization</i> routine performs a one-time initialization operation.

## Syntax

```
RTL_RUN_ONCE_INIT_FN RtlRunOnceInitFn;

_IRQL_requires_same_ ULONG RtlRunOnceInitFn(
  PRTL_RUN_ONCE RunOnce,
  PVOID Context,
  PVOID * Parameter
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`RunOnce`

A pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563626">RTL_RUN_ONCE</a> one-time initialization structure that the driver previously passed as a parameter to the <a href="..\ntddk\nf-ntddk-rtlrunonceexecuteonce.md">RtlRunOnceExecuteOnce</a> routine that called this <i>RunOnceInitialization</i> routine.

`Context`

A pointer to a PVOID variable to which the routine writes the initialization data.

`Parameter`

The <i>Parameter</i> value that the driver passed to the <b>RtlRunOnceExecuteOnce</b> routine that called this <i>RunOnceInitialization</i> routine.


## Return Value

The <i>RunOnceInitialization</i> routine returns a nonzero value to indicate success, and returns zero to indicate failure.

## Remarks

A driver-implemented <i>RunOnceInitialization</i> routine performs driver-specific initialization and then writes the initialization data to the memory location that the <i>Context</i> parameter points to. Drivers use the <b>RtlRunOnceExecuteOnce</b> routine to make a one-time call to a <i>RunOnceInitialization</i> routine. The operating system guarantees that the <i>RunOnceInitialization</i> routine is not called twice for the same value of the <i>RunOnce</i> parameter.

A small number of low-order bits in the location pointed to by the <i>Context</i> parameter are reserved for use by the operating system. Your driver's <i>RunOnceInitialization</i> routine should set these reserved bits to zero in the output value that it writes to *<i>Context</i>. The RTL_RUN_ONCE_CTX_RESERVED_BITS constant defined in Ntddk.h specifies the number of low-order bits that are reserved. Currently, RTL_RUN_ONCE_CTX_RESERVED_BITS is defined to be two, which means that the driver must set the two least significant bits of the PVOID value pointed to by <i>Context</i> to zero.
