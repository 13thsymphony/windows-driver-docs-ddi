# _POWER_THROTTLING_PROCESS_STATE structure
Stores the throttling policies and how to apply them to a target process when that process is subject to power management.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _POWER_THROTTLING_PROCESS_STATE {
  ULONG  Version;
  ULONG  ControlMask;
  ULONG  StateMask;
} POWER_THROTTLING_PROCESS_STATE, POWER_THROTTLING_PROCESS_STATE;
````

## Members


`ControlMask`

Flags that enable the caller to take control of the power throttling mechanism.

<ul>
<li>PROCESS_POWER_THROTTLING_EXECUTION_SPEED: Manages the execution speed of the process.</li>
</ul>

`StateMask`

Flags that manage the power throttling mechanism on/off state.

<ul>
<li>PROCESS_POWER_THROTTLING_EXECUTION_SPEED: Manages the execution speed of the process.</li>
</ul>

`Version`

The version of this structure. Set to PROCESS_POWER_THROTTLING_CURRENT_VERSION.
