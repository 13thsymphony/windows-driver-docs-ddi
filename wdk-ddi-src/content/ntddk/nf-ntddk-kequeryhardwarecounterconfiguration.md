# KeQueryHardwareCounterConfiguration function



## -description
The <b>KeQueryHardwareCounterConfiguration</b> routine queries the operating system for the list of hardware counters to use for thread profiling. 



## -syntax

````
NTSTATUS KeQueryHardwareCounterConfiguration(
  _Out_ PHARDWARE_COUNTER CounterArray,
  _In_  ULONG             MaximumCount,
  _Out_ PULONG            Count
);
````


## -parameters

### -param CounterArray [out]

A pointer to a caller-allocated buffer into which the routine writes an array of elements of type <a href="kernel.hardware_counter">HARDWARE_COUNTER</a>. Each array element is a structure that contains information about a hardware counter. The array contains one element for each hardware counter that is assigned to thread profiling. If the routine fails, it writes nothing to this buffer. 


### -param MaximumCount [in]

Specifies the maximum number of elements that the routine can write to the buffer that is pointed to by the <i>CounterArray</i> parameter. The size of the caller-allocated buffer must be at least <i>MaximumCount</i> * <b>sizeof</b>(<b>HARDWARE_COUNTER</b>) bytes. 


### -param Count [out]

A pointer to a location into which the routine writes the number of array elements that it has written to the buffer that is pointed to by the <i>CounterArray</i> parameter. If the buffer length that is specified by <i>MaximumCount</i> is not large enough to contain the entire array, the routine writes the required length to *<i>Count</i> and returns STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL. 


## -returns
<b>KeQueryHardwareCounterConfiguration</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call is successful. Possible error return values include the following:
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL</b></dt>
</dl>The <i>MaximumCount</i> parameter specifies a buffer length that is not large enough to contain the counter configuration information. 
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED</b></dt>
</dl>This routine is not implemented for the processor architecture that the caller is running on. 

 


## -remarks
In Windows 7, this routine is implemented only for the x86-based, x64-based, and Itanium-based architectures. If the caller is running on a processor architecture that is not supported, the routine returns STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED. 

To set the hardware counter configuration to use for thread profiling, call the <a href="kernel.kesethardwarecounterconfiguration">KeSetHardwareCounterConfiguration</a> routine.
