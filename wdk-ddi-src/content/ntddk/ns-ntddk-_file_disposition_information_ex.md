# _FILE_DISPOSITION_INFORMATION_EX structure
The <b>FILE_DISPOSITION_INFORMATION_EX</b> structure is used as an argument to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff567096">ZwSetInformationFileEx</a> routine and indicates how the operating system should delete a file.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _FILE_DISPOSITION_INFORMATION_EX {
   Flags;
} FILE_DISPOSITION_INFORMATION_EX, *PFILE_DISPOSITION_INFORMATION_EX;
````

## Members


`Flags`

Specifies what action(s) the system should take with a specific file while deleting.

<table>

                   Value</th>

<tr>
<td>FILE_DISPOSITION_DO_NOT_DELETE</td>
<td>
                  0x00000000
                </td>
<td>Specifies the system should not delete a file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FILE_DISPOSITION_DELETE</td>
<td>0x00000001</td>
<td>Specifies the system should delete a file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FILE_DISPOSITION_POSIX_SEMANTICS</td>
<td>0x00000002</td>
<td>Specifies the system should perform a POSIX-style delete.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FILE_DISPOSITION_FORCE_IMAGE_SECTION_CHECK</td>
<td>0x00000004</td>
<td>Specifies the system should force an image section check. </td>

<tr>
<td>FILE_DISPOSITION_ON_CLOSE </td>
<td>0x00000008</td>

</tr>
</table>

## Remarks
The caller must have DELETE access to a given file to call ZwSetInformationFile with <b>FILE_DISPOSITION_DELETE</b>. 

Normally a file marked for deletion is not actually deleted until all open handles for the file have been closed and the link count for the file is zero.  When marking a file for deletion using <b>FILE_DISPOSITION_POSIX_SEMANTICS</b>, the link gets removed from the visible namespace as soon as the POSIX delete handle has been closed, but the file’s data streams remain accessible by other existing handles until the last handle has been closed.
