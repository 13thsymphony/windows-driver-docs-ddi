# _WHEA_FIRMWARE_ERROR_RECORD_REFERENCE structure
The WHEA_FIRMWARE_ERROR_RECORD_REFERENCE structure describes a reference to a firmware error record that is specific to the Itanium processor architecture.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _WHEA_FIRMWARE_ERROR_RECORD_REFERENCE {
  UCHAR     Type;
  UCHAR     Reserved[7];
  ULONGLONG FirmwareRecordId;
} WHEA_FIRMWARE_ERROR_RECORD_REFERENCE, *PWHEA_FIRMWARE_ERROR_RECORD_REFERENCE;
````

## Members


`FirmwareRecordId`

The identifier of the firmware error record.

`Reserved`

Reserved for system use.

`Type`

The type of firmware error record. This member is always set to WHEA_FIRMWARE_RECORD_TYPE_IPFSAL.

## Remarks
The WHEA_FIRMWARE_ERROR_RECORD_REFERENCE structure describes the data that is contained in an Itanium processor firmware error record reference section of an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/080da29a-b5cb-45a5-848d-048d9612ee2a">error record</a>. An error record contains an Itanium processor firmware error record reference section only if the <b>SectionType </b>member of one of the <a href="..\ntddk\ns-ntddk-_whea_error_record_section_descriptor.md">WHEA_ERROR_RECORD_SECTION_DESCRIPTOR</a> structures that describe the error record sections for that error record contains FIRMWARE_ERROR_RECORD_REFERENCE_GUID.

The WHEA_FIRMWARE_ERROR_RECORD_REFERENCE structure contains a reference to a SAL error record that was created by the system firmware. For more information about the format of a SAL error record, see the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=72212">Intel Itanium Processor Family System Abstraction Layer Specification</a>.

## Requirements

| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows version** | Supported in Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista SP1, and later versions of Windows. Supported in Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista SP1, and later versions of Windows. |
