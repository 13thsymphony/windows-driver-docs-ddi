# _BDCB_CLASSIFICATION Enumeration
The BDCB_CLASSIFICATION enumeration lists different classifications of boot start images.

## Syntax
````
typedef enum _BDCB_CLASSIFICATION { 
  BdCbClassificationUnknownImage,
  BdCbClassificationKnownGoodImage,
  BdCbClassificationKnownBadImage,
  BdCbClassificationKnownBadImageBootCritical,
  BdCbClassificationEnd
} BDCB_CLASSIFICATION;
````

## Constants

<table>

<tr>
<td>BdCbClassificationEnd</td>
<td>Do not use. Reserved for future use.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>BdCbClassificationKnownBadImage</td>
<td>The boot start image has been inspected by anti-malware and found to be malware.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>BdCbClassificationKnownBadImageBootCritical</td>
<td>The boot start image has been inspected by anti-malware and found to be malware, but the anti-malware boot-start driver also knows it to be critical to the success of the boot.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>BdCbClassificationKnownGoodImage</td>
<td>The boot start image has been inspected by anti-malware and found not to be malware.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>BdCbClassificationUnknownImage</td>
<td>The boot start image has not been inspected by anti-malware or anti-malware does not have enough information to determine whether the binary is malware.</td>
</tr>
</table>
