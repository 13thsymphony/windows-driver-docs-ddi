# _IMAGE_INFO_EX structure
Extended version of the image information structure (see <a href="..\ntddk\ns-ntddk-_image_info.md">IMAGE_INFO</a>).

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _IMAGE_INFO_EX {
  SIZE_T              Size;
  IMAGE_INFO          ImageInfo;
  struct _FILE_OBJECT  *FileObject;
} IMAGE_INFO_EX, *PIMAGE_INFO_EX;
````

## Members


`_FILE_OBJECT`



`FileObject`

Contains a pointer to the file object of the backing file for the image. The driver can take a reference to this object or use it for other operations.

`ImageInfo`

An <a href="..\ntddk\ns-ntddk-_image_info.md">IMAGE_INFO</a> structure that specifies image information.

`Size`

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the <b>IMAGE_INFO_EX</b> structure.

## Remarks
If the <b>ExtendedInfoPresent</b> flag is set, the <b>IMAGE_INFO</b> structure is part of a larger, extended version of the image information structure. In this case, the load-image notify routine can use the <b>CONTAINING_RECORD</b> macro in the Winnt.h header file to obtain the base address of the <b>IMAGE_INFO_EX</b> structure.

## Requirements
