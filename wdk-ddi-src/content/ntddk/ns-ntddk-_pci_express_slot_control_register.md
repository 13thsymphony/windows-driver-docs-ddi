## -struct-fields

### -field AttentionButtonEnable

A single bit that indicates that the attention button for the slot is enabled to generate events.

### -field PowerFaultDetectEnable

A single bit that indicates that power fault detection for the slot is enabled to generate events.

### -field MRLSensorEnable

A single bit that indicates that the manually operated retention latch (MRL) sensor for the slot is enabled to generate events.

### -field PresenceDetectEnable

A single bit that indicates that card presence detection for the slot is enabled to generate events.

### -field CommandCompletedEnable

A single bit that indicates that notification is enabled for the slot when an issued command is completed by the hot-plug controller.

### -field HotPlugInterruptEnable

A single bit that indicates that interrupts for the slot are enabled for hot-plug events.

### -field AttentionIndicatorControl

The state of the slot's attention indicator. Possible values are:


### -field IndicatorOn

The indicator is on.

### -field IndicatorBlink

The indicator is blinking.

### -field IndicatorOff

The indicator is off.
</dd>

### -field PowerIndicatorControl

The state of the slot's power indicator. Possible values are:


### -field IndicatorOn

The indicator is on.

### -field IndicatorBlink

The indicator is blinking.

### -field IndicatorOff

The indicator is off.
</dd>
</dl>

### -field PowerControllerControl

The state of the slot's power controller. Possible values are:


### -field PowerOn

The power is on.

### -field PowerOff

The power is off.
</dd>
</dl>

### -field ElectromechanicalLockControl

This member always contains zero.

### -field DataLinkStateChangeEnable

A single bit that indicates that notification is enabled for the slot for changes to the data link layer active bit of the link status register of the PCIe capability structure.

### -field Rsvd

Reserved.

### -field AsUSHORT

A USHORT representation of the contents of the PCI_EXPRESS_SLOT_CONTROL_REGISTER structure.

## -remarks
The PCI_EXPRESS_SLOT_CONTROL_REGISTER structure is available in Windows Server 2008 and later versions of Windows.
