# PsGetProcessCreateTimeQuadPart function
The <b>PsGetProcessCreateTimeQuadPart</b> routine returns a LONGLONG value that represents the time at which the process was created.

## Syntax

````
LONGLONG PsGetProcessCreateTimeQuadPart(
  _In_ PEPROCESS Process
);
````

## Parameters

`Process`

A pointer to the EPROCESS structure that represents the process. Drivers can use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559933">PsGetCurrentProcess</a> and <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-obreferenceobjectbyhandle.md">ObReferenceObjectByHandle</a> routines to obtain a pointer to the EPROCESS structure for a process.


## Return Value

<b>PsGetProcessCreateTimeQuadPart</b> returns the process creation time, in 100-nanosecond intervals, since January 1, 1601. The return value is the same as the value that the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-kequerysystemtime.md">KeQuerySystemTime</a> routine returns when the process was created. (Note that if the system time is changed, the value that <b>PsGetProcessCreateTimeQuadPart</b> returns is unaffected.)
