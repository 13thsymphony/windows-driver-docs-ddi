# _PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR structure
The <b>PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure describes the counter resources available on the platform.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR {
  PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE Type;
  ULONG                                     Flags;
  union {
    ULONG  CounterIndex;
    ULONG  ExtendedRegisterAddress;
    struct {
      ULONG Begin;
      ULONG End;
    } Range;
  } u;
} PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR, *PPHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR;
````

## Members


`Flags`

No flags are currently defined. Set this member to zero.

`Type`

Indicates the type of counter resource described by the structure. Set this parameter to one of the following <a href="..\ntddk\ne-ntddk-_physical_counter_resource_descriptor_type.md">PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE</a> enumeration constants:
<ul>
<li>
<b>ResourceTypeSingle</b>

</li>
<li>
<b>ResourceTypeRange</b>

</li>
<li>
<b>ResourceTypeExtendedCounterConfiguration</b>

</li>
<li>
<b>ResourceTypeOverflow</b>

</li>
</ul>

`u`

A union that can contain a <b>CounterIndex</b>, <b>ExtendedRegisterAddress</b>, or <b>Range</b> value.

## Remarks
Most processors have performance monitor units that contain a number of hardware counters for measuring various aspects of system performance. The <b>PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure describes a counter resource, which can be a single hardware counter, a block of contiguous counters, or a counter overflow interrupt. This structure's <b>Type</b> member indicates which type of counter resource is described by the structure.

To specify a set of counter resources, a kernel-mode client can provide an array of <b>PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</b> structures. A <a href="..\ntddk\ns-ntddk-_physical_counter_resource_list.md">PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_LIST</a> structure serves as a header for the array. The client can allocate and free the set of counter resources described by the array as a single unit.

## Requirements

| **Windows Driver kit version** |  |
