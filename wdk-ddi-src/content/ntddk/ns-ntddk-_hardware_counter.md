# _HARDWARE_COUNTER structure



## -description
The <b>HARDWARE_COUNTER</b> structure contains information about a hardware counter. 



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _HARDWARE_COUNTER {
  HARDWARE_COUNTER_TYPE Type;
  ULONG                 Reserved;
  ULONG64               Index;
} HARDWARE_COUNTER, *PHARDWARE_COUNTER;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Type

Specifies the type of the hardware counter. Set this member to the following <a href="..\ntddk\ne-ntddk-_hardware_counter_type.md">HARDWARE_COUNTER_TYPE</a> enumeration value:

<ul>
<li>
<b>PMCCounter</b>

</li>
</ul>

### -field Reserved

Reserved for use by the operating system. Initialize this member to zero. 


### -field Index

Specifies the hardware counter index. Each hardware counter in a performance monitoring unit (PMU) for a processor is identified by an index.


## -remarks
This structure is used by the <a href="..\ntddk\nf-ntddk-kequeryhardwarecounterconfiguration.md">KeQueryHardwareCounterConfiguration</a> and <a href="..\ntddk\nf-ntddk-kesethardwarecounterconfiguration.md">KeSetHardwareCounterConfiguration</a> routines. 

The <b>Type</b> member specifies the type of hardware counter that is described by the structure. In Windows 7, the only defined hardware counter type is <b>PMCCounter</b>, which is a performance monitor counter. This type of counter is used by thread-profiling applications.
