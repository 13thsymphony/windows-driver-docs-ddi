# RtlDelete function
The <b>RtlDelete</b> routine deletes the specified node from the splay link tree.

## Syntax

````
PRTL_SPLAY_LINKS RtlDelete(
  _In_ PRTL_SPLAY_LINKS Links
);
````

## Parameters

`Links`

Pointer to the node to be deleted. The node must have been initialized by calling <b>RtlInitializeSplayLinks</b>.


## Return Value

<b>RtlDelete</b> returns a pointer to the root of the splay link tree from which the given node was deleted, or it returns <b>NULL</b> if the tree is empty.

## Remarks

<b>RtlDelete</b> rebalances the splay link tree after the node is deleted. To delete a node without rebalancing the tree, use <b>RtlDeleteNoSplay</b> instead of <b>RtlDelete</b>.

Callers of the <b>Rtl</b> splay link routines are responsible for synchronizing access to the splay link tree. A fast mutex is the most efficient synchronization mechanism to use for this purpose. 

Callers of <b>RtlDelete</b> must be running at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL if the splay link tree is nonpaged. Usually, callers are running at IRQL PASSIVE_LEVEL.
