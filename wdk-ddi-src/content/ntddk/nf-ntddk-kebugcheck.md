# KeBugCheck function
The <b>KeBugCheck</b> routine brings down the system in a controlled manner when the caller discovers an unrecoverable inconsistency that would corrupt the system if the caller continued to run.

## Syntax

````
VOID KeBugCheck(
  _In_ ULONG BugCheckCode
);
````

## Parameters

`BugCheckCode`

Specifies a value that indicates the reason for the bug check.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

A bug check is a system-detected error that causes an immediate, controlled shutdown of the system. Various kernel-mode components perform run-time consistency checking. When such a component discovers an unrecoverable inconsistency, it causes a bug check to be generated.

Whenever possible, all kernel-mode components should log an error and continue to run, rather than calling <b>KeBugCheck</b>. For example, if a driver is unable to allocate required resources, it should log an error so that the system continues to run; it must not generate a bug check.

A driver or other kernel-mode component should call this routine only in cases of a fatal, unrecoverable error that could corrupt the system itself.

<b>KeBugCheck</b> can be useful in the early stages of developing a driver, or while it is undergoing testing. In these circumstances, the <i>BugCheckCode</i> passed to this routine should be distinct from those codes already in use by Windows or its drivers. For a list of these codes, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/DBA85578-97CF-4BD7-A67D-1C7AD2E9B2BB">Bug Check Codes</a>.

However, even during driver development, this routine is of only limited utility, since it results in a complete system shutdown. A more effective debugging method is to attach a kernel debugger to the system and then use routines that send messages to the debugger or break into the debugger. For further information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6ed74bcc-290c-44e3-943e-4169527dfa18">Using Debugging Code in a Driver</a>.

When a bug check is unavoidable, most system components call <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-kebugcheckex.md">KeBugCheckEx</a>, which provides more information about the cause of such an inconsistency than <b>KeBugCheck</b>.
