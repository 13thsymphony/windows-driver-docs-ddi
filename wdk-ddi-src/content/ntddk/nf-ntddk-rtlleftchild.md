# RtlLeftChild function
The <b>RtlLeftChild</b> routine returns a pointer to the left child of the specified splay link node.

## Syntax

````
PRTL_SPLAY_LINKS RtlLeftChild(
  _In_ PRTL_SPLAY_LINKS Links
);
````

## Parameters

`Links`

Pointer to the node whose left child is to be returned. The node must have been initialized by calling <b>RtlInitializeSplayLinks</b>.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

<b>RtlLeftChild</b> can be called repeatedly in conjunction with <b>RtlParent</b> and <b>RtlRightChild</b> to walk a splay link tree. 

Callers of the <b>Rtl</b> splay link routines are responsible for synchronizing access to the splay link tree. A fast mutex is the most efficient synchronization mechanism to use for this purpose. 

Callers of <b>RtlLeftChild</b> must be running at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL if the tree is nonpaged. Usually, callers are running at IRQL PASSIVE_LEVEL.
