## -struct-fields

### -field Classification

The classification of the boot start image.


### -field ImageFlags

Bit flags that describe the image. The following values are defined.
      

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Bit 0

</td>
<td>
The boot start image is a dependent DLL.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Bit 1

</td>
<td>
The boot start image failed code integrity but load was allowed because of boot policy (code integrity not required on the platform, or code integrity disabled because of boot setting,  debugging, or both).

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Bits 2-31

</td>
<td>
Do not use. Reserved.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -field ImageName

The name of the boot-start driver's binary image.


### -field RegistryPath

The path in the registry where the boot-start driver is registered.


### -field CertificatePublisher

The publisher of the image's certificate. If the image is not signed, the string is empty ("").


### -field CertificateIssuer

The issuer of the image's certificate. If the image is not signed, the string is empty ("").


### -field ImageHash

The Authenticode hash of the image, which can be calculated by  using SignTool.exe (Sign Tool). 


### -field CertificateThumbprint

The hash of the certificate of the signer to be signed. Run <b>certutil –dump x,cer</b> to view this value as  "Signature Hash".


### -field ImageHashAlgorithm

The algorithm of the image hash. The following values are listed for reference.
      

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
ALG_CLASS_HASH

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
ALG_CLASS_ANY

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
ALG_SID_MD5

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
ALG_SID_SHA1

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
ALG_SID_SHA_256

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
ALG_SID_SHA_384

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
ALG_SID_SHA_512

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
CALG_MD5

</td>

CALG_SHA_256

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
CALG_SHA_384

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
CALG_SHA_512

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -field ThumbprintHashAlgorithm

The algorithm of the certificate thumbprint. This member should be ignored if <b>CertificateThumbprint</b> is NULL.


### -field ImageHashLength

The length of data pointed to by the <b>ImageHash</b> member.


### -field CertificateThumbprintLength

The length of data pointed to by the <b>CertificateThumbprint</b> member.
