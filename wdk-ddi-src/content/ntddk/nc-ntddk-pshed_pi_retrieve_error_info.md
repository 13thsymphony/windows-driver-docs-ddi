# PSHED_PI_RETRIEVE_ERROR_INFO callback function
A PSHED plug-in's <i>RetrieveErrorInfo</i> callback function retrieves platform-specific error information about a hardware error that has occurred.

## Syntax

```
PSHED_PI_RETRIEVE_ERROR_INFO PshedPiRetrieveErrorInfo;

NTSTATUS PshedPiRetrieveErrorInfo(
  PVOID PluginContext,
  PWHEA_ERROR_SOURCE_DESCRIPTOR ErrorSource,
  ULONGLONG BufferLength,
  PWHEA_ERROR_PACKET Packet
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`PluginContext`

A pointer to the context area that was specified in the <b>Context</b> member of the <a href="..\ntddk\ns-ntddk-_whea_pshed_plugin_registration_packet.md">WHEA_PSHED_PLUGIN_REGISTRATION_PACKET</a> structure when the PSHED plug-in called the <a href="..\ntddk\nf-ntddk-pshedregisterplugin.md">PshedRegisterPlugin</a> function to register itself with the PSHED.

`ErrorSource`

A pointer to a <a href="..\ntddk\ns-ntddk-_whea_error_source_descriptor.md">WHEA_ERROR_SOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</a> structure that describes the error source that reported the hardware error.

`BufferLength`

The size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by the <i>Packet</i> parameter.

`Packet`

A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560465">WHEA_ERROR_PACKET</a> structure that describes the hardware error packet for the hardware error.


## Return Value

A PSHED plug-in's <i>RetrieveErrorInfo</i> callback function returns one of the following NTSTATUS codes:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The hardware error packet was successfully updated with any platform-specific error information.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The size of the buffer pointed to by the <i>Packet </i>parameter as specified by the <i>BufferLength </i>parameter is too small to contain the hardware error packet if it is updated with the platform-specific error information.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The PSHED plug-in does not support the specified error source.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
An error occurred.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

A PSHED plug-in that participates in error information retrieval sets the <b>Callbacks.RetrieveErrorInfo</b>, <b>Callbacks.FinalizeErrorRecord</b>, and <b>Callbacks.ClearErrorStatus</b> members of the <a href="..\ntddk\ns-ntddk-_whea_pshed_plugin_registration_packet.md">WHEA_PSHED_PLUGIN_REGISTRATION_PACKET</a> structure to point to its <i>RetrieveErrorInfo</i>, <a href="..\ntddk\nc-ntddk-pshed_pi_finalize_error_record.md">FinalizeErrorRecord</a>, and <a href="..\ntddk\nc-ntddk-pshed_pi_clear_error_status.md">ClearErrorStatus</a> callback functions when the plug-in calls the <a href="..\ntddk\nf-ntddk-pshedregisterplugin.md">PshedRegisterPlugin</a> function to register itself with the PSHED. The PSHED plug-in must also set the <b>PshedFAErrorInfoRetrieval</b> flag in the <b>FunctionalAreaMask</b> member of the WHEA_PSHED_PLUGIN_REGISTRATION_PACKET structure.

Each low-level hardware error handler (LLHEH) calls into the PSHED to retrieve any platform-specific error information about a hardware error that has occurred. If a PSHED plug-in is registered to participate in error information retrieval, the PSHED calls the PSHED plug-in's <i>RetrieveErrorInfo</i> callback function so that it can update the hardware error packet with any platform-specific error information. The PSHED plug-in can modify the existing contents of the hardware error packet as well as add supplementary information to the hardware error packet. Supplementary information is added to a hardware error packet beginning at the offset specified by the <b>RawDataOffset</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560465">WHEA_ERROR_PACKET</a> structure.

A PSHED plug-in must ensure that it does not add supplementary information beyond the end of the hardware error packet. The amount of memory that an LLHEH allocates for a buffer to contain a particular hardware error packet is calculated from the <b>MaxRawDataLength</b> member of the <a href="..\ntddk\ns-ntddk-_whea_error_source_descriptor.md">WHEA_ERROR_SOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</a> structure that describes the error source. If a PSHED plug-in requires additional buffer space to contain the supplementary information, it must participate in error source discovery and increase the value in the <b>MaxRawDataLength</b> member of the <b>WHEA_ERROR_SOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure for each error source as appropriate to account for any supplemental information.

For most error sources, the PSHED plug-in's <i>RetrieveErrorInfo</i> callback function is called at a high IRQL. In such a situation, the PSHED plug-in's <i>RetrieveErrorInfo</i> callback function must only perform operations and make calls to other functions that are permitted at a high IRQL.

An important task of a PSHED plug-in's <i>RetrieveErrorInfo</i> callback function is to ensure that the severity of the error condition as specified by the <b>ErrorSeverity</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560465">WHEA_ERROR_PACKET</a> is appropriate. For example, if the severity level of the error condition is reported as <b>WheaErrSevFatal </b>by the LLHEH but the PSHED plug-in supports a recovery mechanism for the particular error condition that was reported, the PSHED plug-in can change the severity level to <b>WheaErrSevRecoverable </b>so that the operating system will attempt recovery from the error. Similarly, if the severity level of the error condition is reported as <b>WheaErrSevRecoverable </b>by the LLHEH but the PSHED plug-in recognizes that attempting recovery of the particular error condition that was reported would only cause further problems, the PSHED plug-in can change the severity level to <b>WheaErrSevFatal </b>so that the operating system will not attempt recovery from the error.

<div class="alert"><b>Important</b>    For corrected hardware errors, a PSHED plug-in must retrieve all of the error status information that it requires for processing the error condition from within its <i>RetrieveErrorInfo</i> callback function, as the remainder of the processing of the hardware error is not guaranteed to be synchronized with the LLHEH.</div>
<div> </div>
The PSHED calls a PSHED plug-in's <i>RetrieveErrorInfo</i> callback function at IRQL &lt;= HIGH_LEVEL. The exact IRQL at which this callback function is called depends on the specific type of hardware error that occurred.
