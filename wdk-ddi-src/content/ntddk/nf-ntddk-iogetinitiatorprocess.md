# IoGetInitiatorProcess function
The IoGetInitiatorProcess routine retrieves the process which initiated the creation of a file object if different than the process which is issuing the create.

## Syntax

````
PEPROCESS WINAPI IoGetInitiatorProcess(
  _In_Â PFILE_OBJECT FileObject
);
````

## Parameters

`FileObject`

The file object from which to retrieve the initiator process.


## Return Value

NULL if there is no initiator process. Otherwise, a pointer to which process initiated the creation of the file object.

## Remarks

A driver normally uses IoGetInitiatorProcess to determine which process has issued a request.  However, there are situations where a system component may issue a create on behalf of another process (after a successful create the component will duplicate the handle to the process).  This routine can be used if the driver must know which process the create operation is ultimately intended for.
