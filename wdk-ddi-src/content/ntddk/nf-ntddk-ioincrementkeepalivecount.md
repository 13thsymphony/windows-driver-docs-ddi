# IoIncrementKeepAliveCount function
The <b>IoIncrementKeepAliveCount</b> routine increments a reference count associated with an Windows app process on a specific device. This routine is called by a kernel mode driver in response to the app opening a process for I/O. This prevents Windows from suspending the app before the I/O process is complete.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS IoIncrementKeepAliveCount(
  _Inout_ PFILE_OBJECT FileObject,
  _Inout_ PEPROCESS    Process
);
````

## Parameters

`FileObject`

The file object handle to the device.

`Process`

The process associated with the device.


## Return Value

This routine returns <b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b> on success, or the appropriate <b>NTSTATUS</b> error code on failure. <b>NTSTATUS</b> error codes are defined in Ntstatus.h.
