# _FILE_ALIGNMENT_INFORMATION structure
The <b>FILE_ALIGNMENT_INFORMATION</b> structure is used as an argument to the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-zwqueryinformationfile.md">ZwQueryInformationFile</a> routine.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _FILE_ALIGNMENT_INFORMATION {
  ULONG AlignmentRequirement;
} FILE_ALIGNMENT_INFORMATION, *PFILE_ALIGNMENT_INFORMATION;
````

## Members


`AlignmentRequirement`

The buffer alignment required by the underlying device. For a list of system-defined values, see <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_device_object.md">DEVICE_OBJECT</a>. The value must be one of the FILE_<i>XXX</i>_ALIGNMENT values defined in Wdm.h. For more information, see <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_device_object.md">DEVICE_OBJECT</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547807">Initializing a Device Object</a>.
