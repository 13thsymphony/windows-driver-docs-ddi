# IoWritePartitionTableEx function
The <b>IoWritePartitionTableEx</b> routine writes partition tables from the entries in the partition list buffer for each partition on the disk represented by the given device object.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS IoWritePartitionTableEx(
  _In_ PDEVICE_OBJECT                      DeviceObject,
  _In_ struct _DRIVE_LAYOUT_INFORMATION_EX *PartitionBuffer
);
````

## Parameters

`DeviceObject`

Pointer to the device object representing the disk whose partition tables are to be written.

`DriveLayout`

TBD


## Return Value

<b>IoWritePartitionTabloEx</b> returns a status code of STATUS_SUCCESS if all writes were completed without error. In case of failure, the error codes returned by <b>IoWritePartitionTableEx</b> might include, but are not limited to, the following list:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_READY</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Indicates a failure read the correct disk geometry.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Indicates a failure to allocate necessary resources (for example, heap memory, IRPs, and so on).

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Indicates that sector zero did not have the expected MBR disk signature.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

<b>IoWritePartitionTableEx</b> replaces the obsolete routine <a href="..\ntddk\nf-ntddk-iowritepartitiontable.md">IoWritePartitionTable</a>. Unlike the older routine, it can write to GUID Partition Tables as well as Master Boot Record Partition Tables. 

<b>IoWritePartitionTableEx</b> must only be used by disk drivers. Other drivers should use the <a href="..\ntdddisk\ni-ntdddisk-ioctl_disk_set_drive_layout_ex.md">IOCTL_DISK_SET_DRIVE_LAYOUT_EX</a> disk I/O request instead.

When a disk device driver receives an IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL request to set the partition type in a partition table entry, or to repartition the disk, it should call <b>IoWritePartionTableEx</b>. The device control request is generally issued by the format utility, which performs I/O control functions on the partitions and disks in the machine.

To reset a partition type, the driver passes a pointer to the device object, representing the physical disk, and the number of the partition associated with the device object that the format utility has open. When a disk is to be repartitioned dynamically, the disk driver must tear down its set of device objects representing the current disk partitions and create a new set of device objects representing the new partitions on the disk.

In order tot create or delete partitions a full description of the system must be obtained by a call to <a href="..\ntddk\nf-ntddk-ioreadpartitiontableex.md">IoReadPartitionTableEx</a>. The drive layout structure can be modified by the system format utility to reflect a new configuration of the disk.

<b>IoWritePartitionTableEx</b> is synchronous. It must be called by the disk driver's Dispatch routine or by a driver thread. Thus, all user and file system threads must be prepared to enter a wait state when issuing the device control request to reset partition types for the device.
