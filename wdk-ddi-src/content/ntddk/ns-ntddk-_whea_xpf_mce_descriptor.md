# _WHEA_XPF_MCE_DESCRIPTOR structure
The WHEA_XPF_MCE_DESCRIPTOR structure describes a machine check exception (MCE) error source for an x86 or x64 processor.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _WHEA_XPF_MCE_DESCRIPTOR {
  USHORT                      Type;
  UCHAR                       Enabled;
  UCHAR                       NumberOfBanks;
  XPF_MCE_FLAGS               Flags;
  ULONGLONG                   MCG_Capability;
  ULONGLONG                   MCG_GlobalControl;
  WHEA_XPF_MC_BANK_DESCRIPTOR Banks[WHEA_MAX_MC_BANKS];
} WHEA_XPF_MCE_DESCRIPTOR, *PWHEA_XPF_MCE_DESCRIPTOR;
````

## Members


`Banks`

An array of <a href="..\ntddk\ns-ntddk-_whea_xpf_mc_bank_descriptor.md">WHEA_XPF_MC_BANK_DESCRIPTOR</a> structures that describe the banks of machine check registers.

`Enabled`

A Boolean value that indicates if the error source is enabled.

`Flags`

An XPF_MCE_FLAGS union that indicates which of the members of the WHEA_XPF_MCE_DESCRIPTOR structure can be written to by the operating system. The XPF_MCE_FLAGS union is defined as follows:
<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>typedef union _XPF_MCE_FLAGS {
  struct {
    UCHAR  MCG_CapabilityRW:1;
    UCHAR  MCG_GlobalControlRW:1;
    UCHAR  Reserved:30;
  };
  UCHAR  AsULONG;
} XPF_MCE_FLAGS, *PXPF_MCE_FLAGS;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>


#### AsULONG

A ULONG representation of the contents of the XPF_MCE_FLAGS union.


#### MCG_CapabilityRW

A single bit that indicates that the operating system can write to the <b>MCG_Capability</b> member of the WHEA_XPF_MCE_DESCRIPTOR structure.


#### MCG_GlobalControlRW

A single bit that indicates that the operating system can write to the <b>MCG_GlobalControl</b> member of the WHEA_XPF_MCE_DESCRIPTOR structure.


#### Reserved

Reserved for system use.

`MCG_Capability`

The contents of the processor's IA32_MCG_CAP model-specific register. This register contains capability information about the machine check architecture of the processor. For more information about the IA32_MCG_CAP register, see the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=78804">Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual</a>.

`MCG_GlobalControl`

The contents of the processor's IA32_MCG_CTL model-specific register. This register controls the reporting of machine check exceptions. For more information about the IA32_MCG_CTL register, see the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=78804">Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual</a>.

`NumberOfBanks`

The number of <a href="..\ntddk\ns-ntddk-_whea_xpf_mc_bank_descriptor.md">WHEA_XPF_MC_BANK_DESCRIPTOR</a> structures contained in the <b>Banks</b> member.

`Type`

The type of error source descriptor. This member is always set to WHEA_ERROR_SOURCE_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_XPFMCE.

## Remarks
A WHEA_XPF_MCE_DESCRIPTOR structure is contained within the <a href="..\ntddk\ns-ntddk-_whea_error_source_descriptor.md">WHEA_ERROR_SOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</a> structure.

## Requirements
