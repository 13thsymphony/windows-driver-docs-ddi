# IoQueryFullDriverPath function
The <b>IoQueryFullDriverPath</b> routine retrieves the full path name of the binary file that is loaded for the specified driver object.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS IoQueryFullDriverPath(
  _In_  PDRIVER_OBJECT  DriverObject,
  _Out_ PUNICODE_STRING FullPath
);
````

## Parameters

`DriverObject`

A pointer to a <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_driver_object.md">DRIVER_OBJECT</a> structure. This structure must be the driver object for the calling driver.

`FullPath`

A pointer to a caller-allocated <a href="..\wudfwdm\ns-wudfwdm-_unicode_string.md">UNICODE_STRING</a> structure. On successful return, this structure contains the path name.


## Return Value

<b>IoQueryFullDriverPath</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call successfully fetches the path name. Possible error return values include the following status codes.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>

<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The target driver object does not belong to the caller.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_NOT_FOUND</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The driver object has no section (loaded memory image) associated with it.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Insufficient resources are available to perform the requested operation.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

A driver can call this routine to query for the full path name of its binary file, but not for the full path name of the binary file for another driver. If the driver object pointed to by the <i>DriverObject</i> parameter does not belong to the calling driver, the call fails and the routine returns an error code.

The caller allocates the <a href="..\wudfwdm\ns-wudfwdm-_unicode_string.md">UNICODE_STRING</a> structure pointed to by the <i>FullPath</i> parameter, but does not need to initialize this structure. <b>IoQueryFullDriverPath</b> assumes that the original contents of this structure are invalid and overwrites them. This routine allocates a string buffer from paged system memory, sets the <b>Buffer</b> member of the structure to point to this buffer, and sets the <b>MaximumLength</b> and <b>Buffer</b> members to describe the buffer and its contents.

The caller is responsible for freeing the storage pointed to by <i>FullPath</i>-&gt;<b>Buffer</b> when the full path string is no longer needed. Typically, the caller frees this storage by calling a routine such as <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exfreepool.md">ExFreePool</a>.
