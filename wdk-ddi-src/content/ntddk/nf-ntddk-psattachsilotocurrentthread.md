# PsAttachSiloToCurrentThread function
This routine places a thread temporarily into the specified <i>Silo</i>.

## Syntax

````
PESILO PsAttachSiloToCurrentThread(
  _In_ PESILO Silo
);
````

## Parameters

`Silo`

The silo that the thread is to impersonate. The caller must hold a  reference to the silo throughout the duration of the impersonation.


## Return Value

The previous silo that was attached to the current thread.

## Remarks

The specified <i>Silo</i> is attached to the current thread so that it becomes the effective silo for the thread.

The thread then operates within the namespace of the attached silo until <a href="..\ntddk\nf-ntddk-psdetachsilofromcurrentthread.md">PsDetachSiloFromCurrentThread</a> is called.
