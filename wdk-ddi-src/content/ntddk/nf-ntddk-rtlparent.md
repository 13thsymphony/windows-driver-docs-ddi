# RtlParent macro



## -description
The <b>RtlParent</b> routine returns a pointer to the parent of the specified node in a splay link tree. 



## -syntax

````
PRTL_SPLAY_LINKS RtlParent(
  _In_ PRTL_SPLAY_LINKS Links
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Links [in]

Pointer to the node. The node must have been initialized by calling <b>RtlInitializeSplayLinks</b>.


## -remarks
<b>RtlParent</b> can be called repeatedly in conjunction with <b>RtlLeftChild</b> and <b>RtlRightChild</b> to walk a splay link tree. 

Callers of the <b>Rtl</b> splay link routines are responsible for synchronizing access to the splay link tree. A fast mutex is the most efficient synchronization mechanism to use for this purpose. 

Callers of <b>RtlParent</b> must be running at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL if the tree is nonpaged. Usually, callers are running at IRQL PASSIVE_LEVEL.
