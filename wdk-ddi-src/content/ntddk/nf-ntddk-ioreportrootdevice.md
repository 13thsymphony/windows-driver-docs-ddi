# IoReportRootDevice function
The <b>IoReportRootDevice</b> routine reports a device that cannot be detected by a PnP bus driver to the PnP Manager.  <b>IoReportRootDevice</b> allows only one device per driver to be created.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS IoReportRootDevice(
  _In_ PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject
);
````

## Parameters

`DriverObject`

Pointer to the driver object of the driver that detected the device.


## Return Value

<b>IoReportRootDevice</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS on success, or the appropriate error code on failure.

## Remarks

Drivers for devices that cannot be detected by a PnP bus driver use <b>IoReportRootDevice</b> to report their device to the system. Devices that can be detected by a PnP bus driver should be reported in response to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551670">IRP_MN_QUERY_DEVICE_RELATIONS</a> request.

A driver typically calls this routine from its <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-driver_initialize.md">DriverEntry</a> routine.

<b>IoReportRootDevice</b> marks the device as a root-enumerated device and this identification is persistent across system boots. The PnP manager "detects" the device on the root-enumerated list and configures it like a PnP device: the PnP manager queries for device information, identifies the appropriate drivers and calls their <i>AddDevice</i> routines, and sends all the appropriate PnP IRPs.

The system generates a single Hardware ID string for the device, of the form ROOT\<i>Driver</i> where <i>Driver</i>  is the driver's service name. A driver can provide additional hardware IDs or compatible IDs by handling the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551679">IRP_MN_QUERY_ID</a> request.

A driver writer must provide an INF file that matches any of the specified hardware IDs or compatible IDs. The INF file should specify the original driver that called <b>IoReportRootDevice</b> as the driver to load for those IDs. The system uses this information to rebuild the driver stack for the device, for example on restart. Callers of <b>IoReportRootDevice</b> must be running at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL in the context of a system thread.


<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Drivers should use <a href="..\ntddk\nf-ntddk-ioreportdetecteddevice.md">IoReportDetectedDevice</a> to report hardware devices that use resources but cannot be detected by a PnP bus driver instead of <b>IoReportRootDevice</b>.</div>
