# IoRegisterBootDriverCallback function



## -description
The <b>IoRegisterBootDriverCallback</b> routine registers a <b>BOOT_DRIVER_CALLBACK_FUNCTION</b> routine to be called during the initialization of a boot-start driver and its dependent DLLs.



## -syntax

````
PVOID IoRegisterBootDriverCallback(
  _In_     PBOOT_DRIVER_CALLBACK_FUNCTION CallbackFunction,
  _In_opt_ PVOID                          CallbackContext
);
````


## -parameters

### -param CallbackFunction [in]

A pointer to the <b>BOOT_DRIVER_CALLBACK_FUNCTION</b> routine to be called when initializing a boot-start driver or DLL.


### -param CallbackContext [in, optional]

A driver-defined context to be passed to the <b>BOOT_DRIVER_CALLBACK_FUNCTION</b> routine pointed to by <i>CallbackFunction</i>.


## -returns
A handle that represents the registration. This handle must be supplied as an input parameter in the call to the  <a href="..\ntddk\nf-ntddk-iounregisterbootdrivercallback.md">IoUnRegisterBootDriverCallback</a> routine that unregisters the <b>BOOT_DRIVER_CALLBACK_FUNCTION</b> routine.


## -remarks
Boot-start drivers must call <a href="..\ntddk\nf-ntddk-iounregisterbootdrivercallback.md">IoUnRegisterBootDriverCallback</a> and pass the returned handle to unregister the boot-start driver callback before Windows unloads them.

A boot-start driver's <b>BOOT_DRIVER_CALLBACK_FUNCTION</b> routine can monitor boot-start driver initialization events and return data to the kernel to enable the kernel to decide whether to initialize each boot-start driver. The function prototype to register a boot-start driver callback routine is as follows.

The boot-start callback parameters are as follows:



The value that the driver passed as the <i>CallbackContext</i> parameter to <b>IoRegisterBootDriverCallback</b> when it registered this <b>BOOT_DRIVER_CALLBACK_FUNCTION</b>  routine.

A <a href="..\ntddk\ne-ntddk-_bdcb_callback_type.md">BDCB_CALLBACK_TYPE</a> enumeration value that either identifies the status of boot-start driver initialization or indicates that a boot-start driver is about to be initialized.

A pointer to a structure that contains information that is specific to the type of callback. The structure type depends on the value passed for <i>CallbackType</i>, as shown in the following table.

<b>BdCbStatusUpdate</b>

<b>BDCB_STATUS_UPDATE_TYPE</b>

<b>BdCbInitializeImage</b>

<b>BDCB_CLASSIFICATION</b>

<b>Return Value</b>

If the <b>BOOT_DRIVER_CALLBACK_FUNCTION</b> routine returns STATUS_SUCCESS, the boot-start driver was able to perform all necessary actions in response to the specific callback.

Any error returned from a status update callback is treated as fatal and leads to a system bug check.

If an initialize image callback returns an error,  the driver's image is treated as unknown.

<b>Remarks</b>

To be notified of boot-start driver initialization operations, an <i>early launch anti-malware</i> (ELAM) driver can call <b>IoRegisterBootDriverCallback</b> to register a <b>BOOT_DRIVER_CALLBACK_FUNCTION</b>  routine.
