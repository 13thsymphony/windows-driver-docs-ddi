# _PCI_EXPRESS_LINK_CONTROL_REGISTER structure



## -description
The PCI_EXPRESS_LINK_CONTROL_REGISTER structure describes a PCI Express (PCIe) link control register of a PCIe capability structure.



## -syntax

````

    USHORT Rsvd1  :1;
    USHORT ReadCompletionBoundary  :1;

## -struct-fields

### -field ActiveStatePMControl

The level of active state power management that is enabled on the PCIe link. Possible values are:




### -field L0sAndL1EntryDisabled

L0s and L1 are both disabled.


### -field L0sEntryEnabled

L0s is enabled.


### -field L1EntryEnabled

L1 is enabled.


### -field L0sAndL1EntryEnabled

L0s and L1 are both enabled.

</dd>
</dl>

### -field Rsvd1

Reserved.


### -field ReadCompletionBoundary

The read completion boundary (RCB) value for the root port or the root port upstream from the endpoint. If the bit is clear, the RCB is 64 byte. If the bit is set, the RCB is 128 byte. This member is not applicable for switch ports.


### -field LinkDisable

A single bit that indicates that the link is disabled. This member is not applicable for endpoint devices, PCIe-to-PCI or PCI-X bridges, and upstream ports of switches.


### -field RetrainLink

A single bit that is used to initiate retraining of the link. Reads of this bit always return zero. This member is not applicable for endpoint devices, PCIe-to-PCI or PCI-X bridges, and upstream ports of switches.


### -field CommonClockConfig

A single bit that indicates that this component and the component at the opposite end of the link are operating with a distributed common reference clock. If this bit is clear, this component and the component at the opposite end of the link are operating with an asynchronous reference clock.


### -field ExtendedSynch

A single bit that indicates that additional ordered sets are transmitted when exiting the L0s state and when in the recovery state.


### -field EnableClockPowerManagement

A single bit that indicates that clock power management is enabled.


### -field Rsvd2

Reserved.


### -field AsUSHORT

A USHORT representation of the contents of the PCI_EXPRESS_LINK_CONTROL_REGISTER structure.


## -remarks
The PCI_EXPRESS_LINK_CONTROL_REGISTER structure is available in Windows Server 2008 and later versions of Windows.

A PCI_EXPRESS_LINK_CONTROL_REGISTER structure is contained in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537460">PCI_EXPRESS_CAPABILITY</a> structure.
