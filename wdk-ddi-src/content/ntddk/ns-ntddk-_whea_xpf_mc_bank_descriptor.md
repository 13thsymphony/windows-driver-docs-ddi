# _WHEA_XPF_MC_BANK_DESCRIPTOR structure



## -description
The WHEA_XPF_MC_BANK_DESCRIPTOR structure describes a bank of machine check registers for an x86 or x64 processor.



## -syntax

  BOOLEAN           ClearOnInitialization;
  UCHAR             StatusDataFormat;
  XPF_MC_BANK_FLAGS Flags;

````


## -struct-fields

### -field BankNumber

The processor machine check register bank number.


### -field ClearOnInitialization

A Boolean value that indicates that the status registers for the bank are to be cleared by the operating system during initialization.


### -field StatusDataFormat

The format of the data in the register bank's status register. Possible values are:




### -field WHEA_XPF_MC_BANK_STATUSFORMAT_IA32MCA

IA32 machine check architecture.


### -field WHEA_XPF_MC_BANK_STATUSFORMAT_Intel64MCA

Intel64 machine check architecture.


### -field WHEA_XPF_MC_BANK_STATUSFORMAT_AMD64MCA

AMD64 machine check architecture.

</dd>
</dl>

### -field Flags

An XPF_MC_BANK_FLAGS union that indicates which of the members of the WHEA_XPF_MC_BANK_DESCRIPTOR structure can be written to by the operating system. The XPF_MC_BANK_FLAGS union is defined as follows:

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>typedef union _XPF_MC_BANK_FLAGS {
  struct {
    UCHAR  ClearOnInitializationRW:1;
    UCHAR  ControlDataRW:1;
    UCHAR  Reserved:6;
  };
  UCHAR  AsUCHAR;
} XPF_MC_BANK_FLAGS, *PXPF_MC_BANK_FLAGS;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>



### -field ClearOnInitializationRW

A single bit that indicates that the operating system can write to the <b>ClearOnInitialization</b> member of the WHEA_XPF_MC_BANK_DESCRIPTOR structure.


### -field ControlDataRW

A single bit that indicates that the operating system can write to the <b>ControlData</b> member of the WHEA_XPF_MC_BANK_DESCRIPTOR structure.


### -field Reserved

Reserved for system use.


### -field AsUCHAR

A UCHAR representation of contents of the XPF_MC_BANK_FLAGS union.

</dd>
</dl>

### -field ControlMsr

The model-specific register address of the register bank's IA32_MCi_CTL register. For more information about the IA32_MCi_CTL register, see the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=78804">Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual</a>.


### -field StatusMsr

The model-specific register address of the register bank's IA32_MCi_STATUS register. For more information about the IA32_MCi_STATUS register, see the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=78804">Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual</a>.


### -field AddressMsr

The model-specific register address of the register bank's IA32_MCi_ADDR register. For more information about the IA32_MCi_ADDR register, see the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=78804">Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual</a>.


### -field MiscMsr

The model-specific register address of the register bank's IA32_MCi_MISC register. For more information about the IA32_MCi_MISC register, see the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=78804">Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual</a>.


### -field ControlData

The value that the operating system writes to the register bank's control register during initialization.


## -remarks
An array of WHEA_XPF_MC_BANK_DESCRIPTOR structures is contained in the <a href="..\ntddk\ns-ntddk-_whea_xpf_cmc_descriptor.md">WHEA_XPF_CMC_DESCRIPTOR</a> and <a href="..\ntddk\ns-ntddk-_whea_xpf_mce_descriptor.md">WHEA_XPF_MCE_DESCRIPTOR</a> structures.
