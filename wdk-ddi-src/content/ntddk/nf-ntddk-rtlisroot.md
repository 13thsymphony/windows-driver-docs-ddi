# RtlIsRoot function
The <b>RtlIsRoot</b> routine determines whether the specified node is the root node of a splay link tree.

## Syntax

````
BOOLEAN RtlIsRoot(
  _In_ PRTL_SPLAY_LINKS Links
);
````

## Parameters

`Links`

Pointer to the node. The node must have been initialized by calling <b>RtlInitializeSplayLinks</b>.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

Callers of the <b>Rtl</b> splay link routines are responsible for synchronizing access to the splay link tree. A fast mutex is the most efficient synchronization mechanism to use for this purpose. 

Callers of <b>RtlIsRoot</b> must be running at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL if the splay link tree or just-initialized node at <i>Links</i> is nonpaged. Usually, callers are running at IRQL PASSIVE_LEVEL.
