# PSHED_PI_GET_ERROR_SOURCE_INFO callback



## -description
A PSHED plug-in's <i>GetErrorSourceInfo</i> callback function returns an error source descriptor structure that represents a particular error source that is implemented by the hardware platform.


## -prototype

````
PSHED_PI_GET_ERROR_SOURCE_INFO GetErrorSourceInfo;

NTSTATUS GetErrorSourceInfo(
  _Inout_opt_ PVOID                         PluginContext,
  _Inout_     PWHEA_ERROR_SOURCE_DESCRIPTOR ErrorSource
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param PluginContext [in, out, optional]

A pointer to the context area that was specified in the <b>Context</b> member of the <a href="whea.whea_pshed_plugin_registration_packet">WHEA_PSHED_PLUGIN_REGISTRATION_PACKET</a> structure when the PSHED plug-in called the <a href="whea.pshedregisterplugin">PshedRegisterPlugin</a> function to register itself with the PSHED.

### -param ErrorSource [in, out]

A pointer to a <a href="whea.whea_error_source_descriptor">WHEA_ERROR_SOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</a> structure that represents a particular error source that is implemented by the hardware platform.

## -returns
A PSHED plug-in's <i>GetErrorSourceInfo</i> callback function returns one of the following NTSTATUS codes:
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>The error source information was successfully updated.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL</b></dt>
</dl>An error occurred.

 

## -remarks
A PSHED plug-in that participates in error source discovery sets the <b>Callbacks.GetAllErrorSources </b>member and, optionally, the <b>Callbacks.GetErrorSourceInfo </b>member of the <a href="whea.whea_pshed_plugin_registration_packet">WHEA_PSHED_PLUGIN_REGISTRATION_PACKET</a> structure to point to its <a href="..\ntddk\nc-ntddk-pshed_pi_get_all_error_sources.md">GetAllErrorSources</a> and <i>GetErrorSourceInfo</i> callback functions when the plug-in calls the <a href="whea.pshedregisterplugin">PshedRegisterPlugin</a> function to register itself with the PSHED. The PSHED plug-in must also set the <b>PshedFADiscovery</b> flag in the <b>FunctionalAreaMask</b> member of the WHEA_PSHED_PLUGIN_REGISTRATION_PACKET structure.

The Windows kernel calls into the PSHED to obtain additional details about a particular error source. This occurs when a new error source is added to the system by a bus driver. For example, when the PCI driver discovers a PCI Express (PCIe) device that is capable of reporting PCIe errors, it reports the error source to the operating system.

If a PSHED plug-in is registered to participate in error source discovery and it has implemented a <i>GetErrorSourceInfo</i> callback function, after the PSHED has updated the error source descriptor structure with the information that it has collected about the error source, the PSHED calls the PSHED plug-in's <i>GetErrorSourceInfo</i> callback function so that the PSHED plug-in can provide additional details about the error source. The <i>GetErrorSourceInfo</i> callback function updates the contents of the error source descriptor structure so that it accurately represents the error source as it is implemented by the hardware platform.
