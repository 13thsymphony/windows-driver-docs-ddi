# MmCopyMemory function



## -description
The <b>MmCopyMemory</b> routine copies the specified range of virtual or physical memory into the caller-supplied buffer.



## -syntax

````
NTSTATUS MmCopyMemory(
  _In_  PVOID           TargetAddress,
  _In_  MM_COPY_ADDRESS SourceAddress,
  _In_  SIZE_T          NumberOfBytes,
  _In_  ULONG           Flags,
  _Out_ PSIZE_T         NumberOfBytesTransferred
);
````


## -parameters

### -param TargetAddress [in]

A pointer to a caller-supplied buffer. This buffer must be in nonpageable  memory.


### -param SourceAddress [in]

An <a href="..\ntddk\ns-ntddk-_mm_copy_address.md">MM_COPY_ADDRESS</a> structure, passed by value, that contains either the virtual address or the physical address of the data to be copied to the buffer pointed to by <i>TargetAddress</i>.


### -param NumberOfBytes [in]

The number of bytes to copy from <i>SourceAddress</i> to <i>TargetAddress</i>.


### -param Flags [in]

Flags that indicate whether <i>SourceAddress</i> is a virtual address or a physical address. The following flag bits are defined for this parameter.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag bit</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MM_COPY_MEMORY_PHYSICAL</td>
<td><i>SourceAddress</i> specifies a physical address.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MM_COPY_MEMORY_VIRTUAL</td>
<td><i>SourceAddress</i> specifies a virtual address.</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

These two flag bits are mutually exclusive. The caller must set one or the other, but not both.


### -param NumberOfBytesTransferred [out]

A pointer to a location to which the routine writes the number of bytes successfully copied from the <i>SourceAddress</i> location to the buffer at <i>TargetAddress</i>.


## -returns
<b>MmCopyMemory</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the entire range has been copied successfully. Otherwise, an error status is returned and the caller must inspect the output value pointed to by the <i>NumberOfBytesTransferred</i> parameter to determine how many bytes were actually copied.


## -remarks
Kernel-mode drivers can call this routine to safely access arbitrary physical or virtual addresses.

If the MM_COPY_MEMORY_PHYSICAL flag is set, <i>SourceAddress</i> should point to regular memory that is under control of the operating system. <b>MmCopyMemory</b> will return an error status code for physical addresses that refer to I/O space, which includes memory-mapped devices and firmware tables. To access physical memory in I/O space, drivers can use the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-mmmapiospace.md">MmMapIoSpace</a> routine.

If the MM_COPY_MEMORY_VIRTUAL flag is set, <i>SourceAddress</i> can point to either a buffer in system address space, or a buffer in the user address space of the current process. If the caller does not control the lifetime of the allocation containing the specified source address, <b>MmCopyMemory</b> might fail or might return inconsistent data, but will not cause a system crash—even for system addresses that are invalid and would trigger a bug check if referenced directly. <b>MmCopyMemory</b> will return an error status code for system virtual addresses that refer to I/O space.

If memory at the virtual address specified by <i>SourceAddress</i> is not resident, <b>MmCopyMemory</b> will try to make it resident.
