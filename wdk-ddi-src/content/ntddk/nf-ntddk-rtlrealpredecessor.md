# RtlRealPredecessor function
The <b>RtlRealPredecessor</b> routine returns a pointer to the predecessor of the specified node in the splay link tree.

## Syntax

````
PRTL_SPLAY_LINKS RtlRealPredecessor(
  _In_ PRTL_SPLAY_LINKS Links
);
````

## Parameters

`Links`

Pointer to the node. The node must have been initialized by calling <b>RtlInitializeSplayLinks</b>.


## Return Value

<b>RtlRealPredecessor</b> returns a pointer to the predecessor of the node at <i>Links</i>, or <b>NULL</b> if the node has no predecessor.

## Remarks

The predecessor of a given node is determined as follows:

<ul>
<li>
If the given node has a left subtree, the rightmost node in the left subtree of the node at <i>Links</i> is the predecessor. Note that <b>RtlSubtreePredecessor</b> returns the same result for this case. 

</li>
<li>
Otherwise, the nearest ancestor node, of which the given node is a right-subtree descendant, is the predecessor. 

</li>
</ul>
Callers of the <b>Rtl</b> splay link routines are responsible for synchronizing access to the splay link tree. A fast mutex is the most efficient synchronization mechanism to use for this purpose. 

Callers of <b>RtlRealPredecessor</b> must be running at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL if the tree is nonpaged. Usually, callers are running at IRQL PASSIVE_LEVEL.
