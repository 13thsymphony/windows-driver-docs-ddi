# IoRegisterDriverReinitialization function
The <b>IoRegisterDriverReinitialization</b> routine is called by a driver during its initialization or reinitialization to register its <a href="..\ntddk\nc-ntddk-driver_reinitialize.md">Reinitialize</a> routine to be called again before the driver's and, possibly the system's, initialization is complete.

## Syntax

````
VOID IoRegisterDriverReinitialization(
  _In_     PDRIVER_OBJECT       DriverObject,
  _In_     PDRIVER_REINITIALIZE DriverReinitializationRoutine,
  _In_opt_ PVOID                Context
);
````

## Parameters

`DriverObject`

Pointer to the driver object that was input to the <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-driver_initialize.md">DriverEntry</a> routine.

`DriverReinitializationRoutine`

Pointer to the driver's <a href="..\ntddk\nc-ntddk-driver_reinitialize.md">Reinitialize</a> routine.

`Context`

Pointer to the context to be passed to the driver's <i>Reinitialize</i> routine.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

A driver can call this routine only if its <i>DriverEntry</i> routine will return STATUS_SUCCESS. If the driver-supplied <a href="..\ntddk\nc-ntddk-driver_reinitialize.md">Reinitialize</a> routine must use the registry, the <i>DriverEntry</i> routine should include a copy of the string to which  <i>RegistryPath</i> points as part of the context passed to the <i>Reinitialize</i> routine in this call.

If the driver is loaded dynamically, it is possible for this to occur during a normally running system, so all references to the reinitialization queue must be synchronized.

The <i>Count</i> input to a <i>DriverReinitializationRoutine</i> indicates how many times this routine has been called, including the current call.

The <i>DriverEntry</i> routine can call <b>IoRegisterDriverReinitialization</b> only once. If the <i>Reinitialize</i> routine should be run again after any other drivers' <i>Reinitialize</i> routines have returned control, the <i>Reinitialize</i> routine also can call <b>IoRegisterDriverReinitialization</b> as many times as the driver's <i>Reinitialize</i> routine should be run.

Usually, a driver with a <i>Reinitialize</i> routine is a higher-level driver that controls both PnP and legacy devices. Such a driver must not only create device objects for the devices that the PnP manager detects (and for which the PnP manager calls the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540521">AddDevice</a> routine), the driver must also create device objects for legacy devices that the PnP manager does not detect. A driver can use a <i>Reinitialize</i> routine to create those device objects and layer the driver over the next-lower driver for the underlying device.
