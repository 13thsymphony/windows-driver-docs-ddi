# _PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_LIST structure
The <b>PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_LIST</b> structure describes an array of <a href="..\ntddk\ns-ntddk-_physical_counter_resource_descriptor.md">PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</a> structures.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_LIST {
  ULONG                                Count;
  PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR Descriptors[ANYSIZE_ARRAY];
} PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_LIST, *PPHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_LIST;
````

## Members


`Count`

The number of elements in the <b>Descriptors</b> array.

`Descriptors`

The first element in an array of <b>PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</b> structures. If the array contains more than one element, the remaining elements immediately follow the first element.

## Remarks
This structure describes a set of counter resources. Most processors have performance monitor units (PMUs) that contain a number of hardware counters to measure various aspects of system performance. A counter resource is a single hardware counter, a block of contiguous counters, or a counter overflow interrupt in a PMU.

The buffer allocated to contain a <b>PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_LIST</b> structure must be large enough to contain the structure plus any <b>PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</b> array elements that follow the structure.

The <a href="..\ntddk\nf-ntddk-halallocatehardwarecounters.md">HalAllocateHardwareCounters</a> routine's <i>ResourceList</i> parameter is a pointer to a <b>PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_LIST</b> structure. In Windows 7, this parameter is unused and must be set to <b>NULL</b>.

## Requirements
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows version** | Supported in Windows 7 and later versions of Windows. Supported in Windows 7 and later versions of Windows. |
| **Header** | ntddk.h (include Ntddk.h, Ntifs.h) |
