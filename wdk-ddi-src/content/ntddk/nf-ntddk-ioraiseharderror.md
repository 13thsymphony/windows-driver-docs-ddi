# IoRaiseHardError function
The <b>IoRaiseHardError</b> routine causes a dialog box to appears that warns the user that a device I/O error has occurred, which might indicate that a physical device is failing.

## Syntax

````
VOID IoRaiseHardError(
  _In_     PIRP           Irp,
  _In_opt_ PVPB           Vpb,
  _In_     PDEVICE_OBJECT RealDeviceObject
);
````

## Parameters

`Irp`

Pointer to the IRP that failed because of a device I/O error.

`Vpb`

Pointer to the volume parameter block (VPB), if any, for the mounted file object. This parameter is <b>NULL</b> if no VPB is associated with the device object.

`RealDeviceObject`

Pointer to the device object that represents the physical device on which the I/O operation failed.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

Highest-level drivers, particularly file system drivers, call <b>IoRaiseHardError</b>.

<div class="alert"><b>Warning</b>  Because 
     <b>IoRaiseHardError</b>
     
      uses a normal kernel APC to create a user dialog box, a deadlock can occur if normal kernel APCs are disabled when a device error occurs. For example:</div>
<div> </div>
<ol>
<li>
An upper-level filter driver calls <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-keentercriticalregion.md">KeEnterCriticalRegion</a> (which disables normal kernel APCs) and sends an I/O request to a file system driver. The filter driver waits on the completion of the request by the file system driver before the filter driver calls <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-keleavecriticalregion.md">KeLeaveCriticalRegion</a> (which reenables normal kernel APCs).

</li>
<li>
An error occurs on the file system, and the file system driver calls <b>IoRaiseHardError</b> to report the error to the user. The file system driver waits on the dialog box.

</li>
<li>
Deadlock now exists: The normal kernel APC created by <b>IoRaiseHardError</b> to create the dialog box waits for normal kernel APCs to be enabled. The file system waits on the dialog box before it completes the I/O request. The filter driver waits on completion of the I/O request before it calls <b>KeLeaveCriticalRegion</b> (which reenables normal kernel APCs).

</li>
</ol>
The behavior of this routine is dependent of the current state of hard errors for the running thread. If hard errors have been disabled by calling <a href="..\ntddk\nf-ntddk-iosetthreadharderrormode.md">IoSetThreadHardErrorMode</a>, this routine completes the IRP specified by <i>Irp</i> without transferring any data into user buffers. In addition, no message is sent to notify the user of this failure.
