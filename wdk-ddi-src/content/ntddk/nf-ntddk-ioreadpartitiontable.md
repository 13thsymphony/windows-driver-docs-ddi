# IoReadPartitionTable function
The <b>IoReadPartitionTable</b> routine is <b>obsolete</b> and is provided only to support existing drivers. New drivers must use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561454">IoReadPartitionTableEx</a>. <b>IoReadPartitionTable</b> reads a list of partitions on a disk having a specified sector size and creates an entry in the partition list for each recognized partition.

## Syntax

```
NTKERNELAPI NTSTATUS IoReadPartitionTable(
  PDEVICE_OBJECT            DeviceObject,
  ULONG                     SectorSize,
  BOOLEAN                   ReturnRecognizedPartitions,
  _DRIVE_LAYOUT_INFORMATION **PartitionBuffer
);
```

## Parameters

`DeviceObject`

Pointer to the device object for the disk whose partitions are to be read.

`SectorSize`

Specifies the size of the sectors on the disk.

`ReturnRecognizedPartitions`

Indicates whether only recognized partitions or all partition entries should be returned.

`PartitionBuffer`

Pointer to an uninitialized address. If successful, <b>IoReadPartitionTable</b> allocates the memory for this buffer from nonpaged pool and returns the drive layout information in it.


## Return Value

This routine returns a value of STATUS_SUCCESS if at least one sector table was read. Otherwise, it returns an error status and sets the pointer at <i>PartitionBuffer</i> to <b>NULL</b>.

## Remarks

<b>IoReadPartitionTable</b> must only be used by disk drivers. Other drivers should use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560361">IOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_LAYOUT</a> disk I/O request instead.

Disk device drivers call this routine during driver initialization.

It is the responsibility of the caller to deallocate the <i>PartitionBuffer</i> that was allocated by this routine with <b>ExFreePool</b>.

The algorithm used by this routine is determined by the Boolean value <i>ReturnRecognizedPartitions</i>:

<ul>
<li>
Read each partition table and, for each valid and recognized partition found, fill in an element in an array of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563751">PARTITION_INFORMATION</a> entries. The array of partition information entries is pointed to by the <b>PartitionEntry</b> member of a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552659">DRIVE_LAYOUT_INFORMATION</a> structure. The DRIVE_LAYOUT_INFORMATION structure is found at the location pointed to by <i>PartitionBuffer</i>. Extended partitions are located in order to find other partition tables, but no entries are built for them.

</li>
</ul>
Read each partition table and, for each and every entry, fill in a partition information entry. Extended partitions are located to find each partition on the disk; entries are built for these as well.
