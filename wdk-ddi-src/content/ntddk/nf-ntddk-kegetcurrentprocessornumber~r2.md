# KeGetCurrentProcessorNumber function



## -description
The <b>KeGetCurrentProcessorNumber</b> routine returns the system-assigned number of the current processor on which the caller is running.


## -syntax

````
ULONG KeGetCurrentProcessorNumber(void);
````


## -parameters


## -returns
<b>KeGetCurrentProcessorNumber</b> returns a ULONG value that represents the processor on which the caller is currently running. 

<b>KeGetCurrentProcessorNumber</b> returns a ULONG value that represents the processor on which the caller is currently running. 

<b>KeGetCurrentProcessorNumber</b> returns a ULONG value that represents the processor on which the caller is currently running. 

## -remarks
<b>KeGetCurrentProcessorNumber</b> can be called to debug spin lock usage on SMP machines during driver development. A driver also might call <b>KeGetCurrentProcessorNumber</b> if it maintained some per-processor data and attempted to reduce cache-line contention.

The number of processors in an SMP machine is a zero-based value.

Windows 7 and later versions of Windows support processor groups. Drivers that are designed to handle information about processor groups should use the <a href="kernel.kegetcurrentprocessornumberex">KeGetCurrentProcessorNumberEx</a> routine, which specifies a processor group, instead of <b>KeGetCurrentProcessorNumber</b>, which does not. However, the implementation of <b>KeGetCurrentProcessorNumber</b> in Windows 7 and later versions of Windows provides compatibility for drivers that were written for earlier versions of Windows. In this implementation, <b>KeGetCurrentProcessorNumber</b> returns the group-relative processor number if the caller is running on a processor in group 0, which is compatible with the behavior of this routine in earlier versions of Windows that do not support processor groups. If the caller is running on a processor in any group other than group 0, this routine returns a number that is less than the number of processors in group 0. This behavior ensures that the return value is less than the return value of the <a href="kernel.kequeryactiveprocessorcount">KeQueryActiveProcessorCount</a> routine.

If the call to <b>KeGetCurrentProcessorNumber</b> occurs at IRQL &lt;= APC_LEVEL, a processor switch can occur between instructions. Consequently, callers of <b>KeGetCurrentProcessorNumber</b> usually run at IRQL &gt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL.
