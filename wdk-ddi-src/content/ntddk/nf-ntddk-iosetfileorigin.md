# IoSetFileOrigin function
The <b>IoSetFileOrigin</b> routine specifies whether a given file object is for a remote create request.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS IoSetFileOrigin(
  _In_ PFILE_OBJECT FileObject,
  _In_ BOOLEAN      Remote
);
````

## Parameters

`FileObject`

Pointer to the file object.

`Remote`

Set to <b>TRUE</b> to set the FO_REMOTE_ORIGIN flag on the file object, <b>FALSE</b> to clear it.


## Return Value

If the FO_REMOTE_ORIGIN flag on the file object is not already set (or cleared) as specified by the <i>Remote</i> parameter, <b>IoSetFileOrigin</b> sets or clears the flag as appropriate and returns STATUS_SUCCESS. 

If the flag is already set (or cleared) as specified, <b>IoSetFileOrigin</b> returns STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER_MIX and does not set or clear the flag.

## Remarks

Network file systems call <b>IoSetFileOrigin</b> to set or clear the FO_REMOTE_ORIGIN flag on the file object pointed to by <i>FileObject</i>. This flag is set to indicate that the file object was created to satisfy a remote create request. 

Network file systems should call <b>IoSetFileOrigin</b> in their servers for any file objects that are created to satisfy a create request from a network client. 

File system filter drivers should not call <b>IoSetFileOrigin</b>.
