# IoDeleteController function
The <b>IoDeleteController</b> routine removes a given controller object from the system, for example, when the driver that created it is being unloaded.

## Syntax

````
VOID IoDeleteController(
  _In_ PCONTROLLER_OBJECT ControllerObject
);
````

## Parameters

`ControllerObject`

Pointer to the controller object to be released.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

<b>IoDeleteController</b> deallocates the memory for the controller object, including the controller extension.

This routine must be called when a driver that created a controller object is being unloaded or when the driver encounters a fatal error during device start-up, such as being unable to properly initialize a physical device.

A driver must release certain resources for which the driver supplied storage in its controller extension before it calls <b>IoDeleteController</b>. For example, if the driver stores the pointer to its interrupt object(s) in the controller extension, it must call <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iodisconnectinterrupt.md">IoDisconnectInterrupt</a> before <b>IoDeleteController</b>.
