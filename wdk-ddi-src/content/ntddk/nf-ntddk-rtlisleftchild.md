# RtlIsLeftChild macro



## -description
The <b>RtlIsLeftChild</b> routine determines whether a given splay link is the left child of a node in a splay link tree. 



## -syntax

````
BOOLEAN RtlIsLeftChild(
  _In_ PRTL_SPLAY_LINKS Links
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Links [in]

Pointer to the node. The node must have been initialized by calling <b>RtlInitializeSplayLinks</b>.


## -remarks
The given node at <i>Links</i> must have a parent node in the tree. A caller can determine whether this node has a parent with <b>RtlIsRoot</b>. If <b>RtlIsRoot</b> returns <b>FALSE</b>, <i>Links</i> is a valid parameter to <b>RtlIsLeftChild</b>. 

Callers of the <b>Rtl</b> splay link routines are responsible for synchronizing access to the splay link tree. A fast mutex is the most efficient synchronization mechanism to use for this purpose. 

Callers of <b>RtlIsLeftChild</b> can be running at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL if the splay link tree is nonpaged. Usually, callers are running at IRQL PASSIVE_LEVEL.
