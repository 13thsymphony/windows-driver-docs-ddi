# IoRegisterBootDriverReinitialization function
The <b>IoRegisterBootDriverReinitialization</b> routine is called by a boot driver to register the driver's reinitialization routine with the I/O manager to be called after all devices have been enumerated and started.

## Syntax

````
VOID IoRegisterBootDriverReinitialization(
  _In_     PDRIVER_OBJECT       DriverObject,
  _In_     PDRIVER_REINITIALIZE DriverReinitializationRoutine,
  _In_opt_ PVOID                Context
);
````

## Parameters

`DriverObject`

Pointer to the driver object for the boot driver to be reinitialized.

`DriverReinitializationRoutine`

Pointer to the driver's <a href="..\ntddk\nc-ntddk-driver_reinitialize.md">Reinitialize</a> routine.

`Context`

Optional context pointer to be passed to the driver's reinitialization routine.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

A boot driver normally calls <b>IoRegisterBootDriverReinitialization</b> from its <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-driver_initialize.md">DriverEntry</a> routine, which is run during boot driver initialization. <b>IoRegisterBootDriverReinitialization</b> registers the driver's reinitialization callback routine to be called by the I/O manager after all devices have been enumerated and started. The <i>DriverReinitializationRoutine</i> is run in a system thread at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL. 

A driver should call <b>IoRegisterBootDriverReinitialization</b> only if its <i>DriverEntry</i> routine will return STATUS_SUCCESS. 

If the <i>DriverReinitializationRoutine</i> uses the registry, the <i>DriverEntry</i> routine must include in <b>IoRegisterBootDriverReinitialization</b>'s <i>Context</i> parameter a copy of the string to which <i>DriverEntry</i>'s own <i>RegistryPath</i> parameter points. 

The <i>DriverEntry</i> routine can call <b>IoRegisterBootDriverReinitialization</b> only once. If the reinitialization routine needs to be run more than once, the <i>DriverReinitializationRoutine</i> can call <b>IoRegisterBootDriverReinitialization</b> as many additional times as needed, using the <i>Count</i> parameter to keep track of the number of times the <i>DriverReinitializationRoutine</i> has been called.
