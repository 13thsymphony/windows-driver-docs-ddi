# PADAPTER_RECEIVE_PACKET_ROUTINE callback function
A camera minidriver's <i>AdapterReceivePacket</i> callback function processes adapter-based stream request blocks (SRBs) passed to it by the stream class driver.

## Syntax

```
PADAPTER_RECEIVE_PACKET_ROUTINE PadapterReceivePacketRoutine;

void PadapterReceivePacketRoutine(
  PHW_STREAM_REQUEST_BLOCK Srb
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Srb`

Specifies the SRB to be processed by the camera minidriver.


## Return Value

<i>AdapterReceivePacket</i> does not return a value.

## Remarks

A camera's minidriver provides USBCAMD with the address of its <i>AdapterReceivePacket</i> function that processes SRBs in its call to the <b>USBCAMD_DriverEntry</b> service.
