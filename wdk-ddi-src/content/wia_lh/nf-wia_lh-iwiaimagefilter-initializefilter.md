# InitializeFilter method
The <b>IWiaImageFilter::InitializeFilter</b> method stores the references to <i>pWiaItem2</i> and <i>pWiaTransferCallback</i> parameters passed into the method.

## Syntax

````
HRESULT InitializeFilter(
  [in] IWiaItem2              *pWiaItem2,
  [in] IWiaTransferCallback   *pWiaTransferCallback 
);
````

## Parameters

`pWiaItem2`

Points to the <b>IWiaItem2</b> item that the image acquisition was initiated for by the application. In the case of <b>IWiaTransfer::Download</b>, it is the WIA item from which we obtained the <b>IWiaTransfer</b> interface, and in the case of the Preview component, it is the item that we pass into the <b>IWiaPreview::GetNewPreview</b> method.

`pWiaTransferCallback`

Points to a <a href="..\wia_lh\nn-wia_lh-iwiatransfercallback.md">IWiaTransferCallback</a> interface. The IWiaTransferCallback interface is the application's callback interface, which is passed to <b>IWiaTransfer::Download</b> and <b>IWiaPreview::GetNewPreview</b>.


## Return Value

Returns S_OK on success, or a standard COM error code on failure.

## Remarks

This method is called by the COM proxy object (described in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation) before the download call reaches the WIA service. This happens in two cases: when an application calls <b>IWiaTransfer::Download</b> method and when an application calls the <b>IWiaPreview::GetNewPreview</b> method. 

All that <b>IWiaImageFilter::InitializeFilter</b> is required to do is to store the references to <i>pWiaItem2</i> and <i>pWiaTransferCallback</i> that are passed into it. These interface pointers should be stored as member variables in this method and <b>AddRef</b> should be called for each interface pointer. These two interface pointers are needed in the filter's implementation of <b>IWiaTransferCallback::TransferCallback</b> and <b>IWiaTransferCallback::GetNextStream</b> methods.

The <b>IWiaTransferCallback</b> and <b>IWiaPreview</b> interfaces are described in the Windows SDK documentation.

This method cannot be invoked directly by the application.

The <b>IWiaItem2, IWiaPreview</b> and <b>IWiaTransfer</b> interfaces are described in the Windows SDK documentation.
