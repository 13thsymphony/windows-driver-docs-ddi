# EVT_UFX_DEVICE_HOST_DISCONNECT function



## -description
The client driver's implementation to disable the function controller's communication with the host.



## -syntax

````
EVT_UFX_DEVICE_HOST_DISCONNECT EvtUfxDeviceHostDisconnect
;

void EvtUfxDeviceHostDisconnect
(
  _In_ UFXDEVICE UfxDevice
)
{ ... }

typedef EVT_UFX_DEVICE_HOST_DISCONNECT PFN_UFX_DEVICE_HOST_DISCONNECT;
````


## -parameters

### -param UfxDevice [in]

The handle to a  USB device object that the client driver received in a previous call to  the <a href="..\ufxclient\nf-ufxclient-ufxdevicecreate.md">UfxDeviceCreate</a>.


## -returns
This callback function does not return a value.


## -remarks
The client driver for the function host controller registers its <i>EVT_UFX_DEVICE_HOST_DISCONNECT</i> implementation with the USB function class extension (UFX) by calling the <a href="..\ufxclient\nf-ufxclient-ufxdevicecreate.md">UfxDeviceCreate</a> method.

UFX invokes this  event callback to perform a soft-disconnect on the USB cable. After this call, the client driver must not initiate a connection with the host until UFX invokes <a href="..\ufxclient\nc-ufxclient-evt_ufx_device_host_connect.md">EVT_UFX_DEVICE_HOST_CONNECT</a>. 

The client driver indicates completion of this event by calling the <a href="..\ufxclient\nf-ufxclient-ufxdeviceeventcomplete.md">UfxDeviceEventComplete</a> method.
