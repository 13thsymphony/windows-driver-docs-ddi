# EVT_UFX_DEVICE_PROPRIETARY_CHARGER_DETECT function



## -description
The client driver's implementation to initiate proprietary charger detection.



## -syntax

````
EVT_UFX_DEVICE_PROPRIETARY_CHARGER_DETECT EvtUfxDeviceDetectProprietaryCharger;

void EvtUfxDeviceDetectProprietaryCharger(
  _In_ UFXDEVICE UfxDevice
)
{ ... }

typedef EVT_UFX_DEVICE_PROPRIETARY_CHARGER_DETECT PFN_UFX_DEVICE_PROPRIETARY_CHARGER_DETECT;
````


## -parameters

### -param UfxDevice [in]

The handle to a  USB device object that the client driver received in a previous call to  the <a href="..\ufxclient\nf-ufxclient-ufxdevicecreate.md">UfxDeviceCreate</a>.


## -returns
This callback function does not return a value.


## -remarks
<i>EVT_UFX_DEVICE_DETECT_PROPRIETARY_CHARGER</i> is an optional event callback. The client driver is required to implement this event callback only if it supports proprietary charger detection. The driver indicates its support in the <a href="..\ufxclient\nf-ufxclient-ufxdevicecreate.md">UfxDeviceCreate</a> call by setting <b>PdcpSupported</b> to TRUE in <a href="..\ufxbase\ns-ufxbase-_ufx_device_capabilities.md">UFX_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES</a>. If the client driver does not support the functionality, the <b>EvtDeviceProprietaryChargerDetect</b>, <b>EvtDeviceProprietaryChargerSetProperty</b>, and <b>EvtDeviceProprietaryChargerReset</b>
members of the <a href="..\ufxclient\ns-ufxclient-_ufx_device_callbacks.md">UFX_DEVICE_CALLBACKS</a> structure must be set to NULL in   <b>UfxDeviceCreate</b>.   

The client driver indicates completion of this event by calling the <a href="..\ufxclient\nf-ufxclient-ufxdeviceproprietarychargerdetectcomplete.md">UfxDeviceProprietaryChargerDetectComplete</a> method.

The client driver sends a request to the lower filter driver to determine if a proprietary charger is present. In response, the filter driver provides a GUID for each charger type it supports, and a list of that charger’s properties.  If a specific charger is configurable, the filter driver also provides a list of supported PropertyIDs and their possible values to configure the charger.
