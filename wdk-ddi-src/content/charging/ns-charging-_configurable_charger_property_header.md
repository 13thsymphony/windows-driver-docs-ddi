# _CONFIGURABLE_CHARGER_PROPERTY_HEADER structure
The CONFIGURABLE_CHARGER_PROPERTY_HEADER structure is a header that is used to create your own structure as an input to <a href="..\charging\ni-charging-ioctl_internal_configure_charger_property.md">IOCTL_INTERNAL_CONFIGURE_CHARGER_PROPERTY</a>.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _CONFIGURABLE_CHARGER_PROPERTY_HEADER {
  ULONG Size;
  GUID  ChargerId;
  ULONG PropertyId;
} CONFIGURABLE_CHARGER_PROPERTY_HEADER, *PCONFIGURABLE_CHARGER_PROPERTY_HEADER;
````

## Members


`ChargerId`

The charger ID.

`PropertyId`

The ID of the property to be configured.

`Size`

Size of the structure.

## Remarks
Extend this structure to add your own values for the input to <a href="..\charging\ni-charging-ioctl_internal_configure_charger_property.md">IOCTL_INTERNAL_CONFIGURE_CHARGER_PROPERTY</a>. Create a new structure with <b>CONFIGURABLE_CHARGER_PROPERTY_HEADER</b> as the first field, and one or more values after it that correspond to your <b>PropertyId</b>. Here are two example structures.
<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>struct SET_MY_CHARGER_VOLTAGE {
    CONFIGURABLE_CHARGER_PROPERTY_HEADER Header;
    ULONG Voltage;
};</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div><div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>struct SET_MY_CHARGER_CURRENT_AND_VOLTAGE {
    CONFIGURABLE_CHARGER_PROPERTY_HEADER Header;
    ULONG Current;
    ULONG Voltage;
};</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>Make sure you set <b>Header.Size</b> to the appropriate size of your new structure.
<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>Header.Size = sizeof(SET_MY_CHARGER_VOLTAGE);</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
