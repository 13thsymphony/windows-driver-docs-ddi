# IOCTL_NFCSE_GET_NEXT_EVENT IOCTL
The <b>IOCTL_NFCSE_GET_NEXT_EVENT</b> 
   control code returns the next event available in the buffer, or if there are no more buffered events remains pending until a secure element event is available. The event details must then be returned to the caller.

### Major Code
[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](xref:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control")

### Input Buffer
None

### Input Buffer Length
None

### Output Buffer
A <b>DWORD</b> indicating the size of the <a href="..\nfcsedev\ns-nfcsedev-_secure_element_event_info.md">SECURE_ELEMENT_EVENT_INFO</a> structure plus its payload, immediately followed by the <b>SECURE_ELEMENT_EVENT_INFO</b> structure itself.

### Output Buffer Length

### Status Block
I/O Status block
<b>Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status</b> is set to <b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b> if the request is successful. Possible error codes are:

    ## Remarks
        The following are requirements that the driver must adhere to.<ul>
<li>
This IOCTL must be called on a handle that has an <b>SEEvents</b> relative file name; otherwise, the driver returns STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_STATE

</li>
<li>
This driver must support CancelIO for this pending IOCTL.

</li>
<li>
This driver must maintain a received queue of the received secure element events that match the subscription type.

</li>
<li>
The following conditions must be met when this IOCTL is received in the driver:

<ul>
<li>
If the received queue is empty, then the driver must pend the IOCTL for later completion.

</li>
<li>
If the received queue is non-empty, then the driver must de-queue one event, copy the message buffer to the IOCTL’s output buffer, and complete the IOCTL with <b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b> immediately.

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
If the driver completes this IOCTL with STATUS_SUCCESS, the first DWORD [4 bytes] of the output buffer must contain the size of the SECURE_ELEMENT_EVENT_INFO structure plus its payload.

</li>
<li>
If a received secure element event info is too large to be copied into this IOCTL’s buffer, the driver must copy the required buffer size into the first 4 bytes of the output buffer, set the IOCTL’s information field to sizeof(DWORD), and complete the IOCTL with <b>STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW</b>. The event must then be left in the received queue.

</li>
</ul>
