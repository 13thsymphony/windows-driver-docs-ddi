# _TAPE_ERASE structure
The TAPE_ERASE structure is used in conjunction with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560615">IOCTL_TAPE_ERASE</a> request to erase the current tape partition.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct _TAPE_ERASE {
  ULONG   Type;
  BOOLEAN Immediate;
} TAPE_ERASE, *PTAPE_ERASE;
```

## Members


`Type`

Indicates the type of erasure to perform. When this member is set to TAPE_ERASE_LONG, the tape partition is overwritten with a filler pattern. When it is set to TAPE_ERASE_SHORT, an end-of-recorded-data mark is written to the current position.

`Immediate`

Indicates that the target device should return status immediately, when set to <b>TRUE</b>. When this member is set to <b>FALSE</b>, the device should return status after the operation is complete.
