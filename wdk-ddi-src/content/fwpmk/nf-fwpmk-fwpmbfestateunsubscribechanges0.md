# FwpmBfeStateUnsubscribeChanges0 function



## -description
The 
  <b>FwpmBfeStateUnsubscribeChanges0</b> function deregisters a base filtering engine (BFE) callback function that was previously
  registered by calling the 
  <a href="..\fwpmk\nf-fwpmk-fwpmbfestatesubscribechanges0.md">
  FwpmBfeStateSubscribeChanges0</a> function.



## -syntax

````
NTSTATUS NTAPI FwpmBfeStateUnsubscribeChanges0(
  _Inout_ HANDLE changeHandle
);
````


## -parameters

### -param changeHandle [in, out]

A handle associated with the registration of the callback function that is being deregistered.
     This handle was returned to the callout driver when it called the 
     <a href="..\fwpmk\nf-fwpmk-fwpmbfestatesubscribechanges0.md">FwpmBfeStateSubscribeChanges0</a> function to register the callback function.


## -returns
The 
     <b>FwpmBfeStateUnsubscribeChanges0</b> function returns one of the following NTSTATUS codes:
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>The callback function was successfully deregistered.
<dl>
<dt><b>Other status codes</b></dt>
</dl>An error occurred.

 


## -remarks
A callout driver calls the 
    <b>FwpmBfeStateUnsubscribeChanges0</b> function to deregister a callback function that was previously
    registered by calling the 
    <a href="..\fwpmk\nf-fwpmk-fwpmbfestatesubscribechanges0.md">
    FwpmBfeStateSubscribeChanges0</a> function.

If a callout driver registers a callback function by calling the 
    <a href="..\fwpmk\nf-fwpmk-fwpmbfestatesubscribechanges0.md">
    FwpmBfeStateSubscribeChanges0</a> function, it must deregister the callback function before the callout
    driver can be unloaded.

Do not call <b>FwpmBfeStateUnsubscribeChanges0</b> from a callback function that your driver previously registered by calling <a href="..\fwpmk\nf-fwpmk-fwpmbfestatesubscribechanges0.md">
    FwpmBfeStateSubscribeChanges0</a>. Doing so can cause a deadlock.
