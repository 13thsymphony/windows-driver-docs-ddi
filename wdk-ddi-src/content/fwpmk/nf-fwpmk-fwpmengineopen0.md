# FwpmEngineOpen0 function
The 
  <b>FwpmEngineOpen0</b> function opens a session to the filter engine.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  <b>FwpmEngineOpen0</b> is a specific version of <b>FwpmEngineOpen</b>. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/FBDF53E5-F7DE-4DEB-AC18-6D2BB59FE670">WFP Version-Independent Names and Targeting Specific Versions of Windows</a> for more information.</div><div> </div>

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS NTAPI FwpmEngineOpen0(
  _In_opt_ const wchar_t                   *serverName,
  _In_           UINT32                    authnService,
  _In_opt_       SEC_WINNT_AUTH_IDENTITY_W *authIdentity,
  _In_opt_ const FWPM_SESSION0             *session,
  _Out_          HANDLE                    *engineHandle
);
````

## Parameters

`serverName`

A pointer to a NULL-terminated string that specifies the standard DNS name of the system on which
     the session to the filter engine is opened. Callout drivers must specify <b>NULL</b> for this parameter.

`authnService`

The authentication service to use. For a list of valid choices for this parameter, see
     Authentication-Service Constants in the RPC section in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation. Callout
     drivers must specify either RPC_C_AUTHN_WINNT or RPC_C_AUTHN_DEFAULT for this parameter.

`authIdentity`

A pointer to a <b>SEC_WINNT_AUTH_IDENTITY_W</b> structure that contains the authentication and
     authorization credentials for accessing the filter engine. This parameter is ignored when the 
     <b>FwpmEngineOpen0</b> function is called from a callout driver. Callout drivers should set this
     parameter to <b>NULL</b>.

`session`

A pointer to an 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550083">FWPM_SESSION0</a> structure that defines
     session-specific parameters for the session being opened. This pointer is optional and can be
     <b>NULL</b>.

`engineHandle`

A pointer to a variable that receives a handle for the open session to the filter engine.


## Return Value

The 
     <b>FwpmEngineOpen0</b> function returns one of the following NTSTATUS codes.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>

<td width="40%">

<td width="60%">
A session to the filter engine was successfully opened. The variable pointed to by the 
       <i>engineHandle</i> parameter contains a handle for the open session.

## Remarks

A callout driver calls the 
    <b>FwpmEngineOpen0</b> function to open a session to the filter engine. A handle to an open session to the
    filter engine is a required parameter to most of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/0436f559-20e6-4199-8391-10eb7d85df23">Windows Filtering Platform</a>
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-performance/computer-management-storage-disk-management/f93a4e9b-5516-4e5c-9cd3-f04453ec963f"> management functions</a>.

Callout drivers normally do not need to open a session to the filter engine because callout drivers
    typically do not call any of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/0436f559-20e6-4199-8391-10eb7d85df23">Windows Filtering Platform</a> management functions.

For a callout driver to successfully open a session to the filter engine, the filter engine
    must be currently running at the time that the callout driver calls the 
    <b>FwpmEngineOpen0</b> function. A callout driver can call the 
    <a href="..\fwpmk\nf-fwpmk-fwpmbfestateget0.md">FwpmBfeStateGet0</a> function to obtain the
    current state of the filter engine. Before calling <b>FwpmBfeStateGet0</b>, the callout driver must call the 
    <a href="..\fwpmk\nf-fwpmk-fwpmbfestatesubscribechanges0.md">FwpmBfeStateSubscribeChanges0</a> function to register a callback function that will be called whenever
    there is a change in the state of the filter engine.

After a callout driver has finished accessing the filter engine, it calls the 
    <a href="..\fwpmk\nf-fwpmk-fwpmengineclose0.md">FwpmEngineClose0</a> function to close the
    open session to the filter engine.
