  <b>FwpmCalloutDeleteById0</b> function deletes a callout from the filter engine.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  <b>FwpmCalloutDeleteById0</b> is a specific version of <b>FwpmCalloutDeleteById</b>. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/FBDF53E5-F7DE-4DEB-AC18-6D2BB59FE670">WFP Version-Independent Names and Targeting Specific Versions of Windows</a> for more information.</div><div> </div>

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS NTAPI FwpmCalloutDeleteById0(
  _In_ HANDLE engineHandle,
  _In_ UINT32 id
);
````

## Parameters

`engineHandle`

A handle for an open session to the filter engine. A callout driver calls the 
     <a href="..\fwpmk\nf-fwpmk-fwpmengineopen0.md">FwpmEngineOpen0</a> function to open a
     session to the filter engine.

`id`

The run-time identifier for the callout that is being deleted from the filter engine. This must be
     the run-time identifier that was returned when the callout driver called the 
     <a href="..\fwpmk\nf-fwpmk-fwpmcalloutadd0.md">FwpmCalloutAdd0</a> function to add the
     callout to the filter engine.


## Return Value

The 
     <b>FwpmCalloutDeleteById0</b> function returns one of the following NTSTATUS codes.

## Remarks

A callout driver calls the 
    <b>FwpmCalloutDeleteById0</b> function to delete a callout from the filter engine, using the run-time
    identifier to identify the callout to be deleted.

Callout drivers do not typically delete their callouts from the filter engine. In most situations, this
    is handled by a user-mode <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/0436f559-20e6-4199-8391-10eb7d85df23">Windows Filtering Platform</a> management application.

A callout can be deleted from the filter engine only if there are no filters in the filter engine that
    specify the callout for the filter's action.
