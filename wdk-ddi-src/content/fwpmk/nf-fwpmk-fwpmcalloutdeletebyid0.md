# FwpmCalloutDeleteById0 function



## -description
The 
  <b>FwpmCalloutDeleteById0</b> function deletes a callout from the filter engine.



## -syntax

````
NTSTATUS NTAPI FwpmCalloutDeleteById0(
  _In_ HANDLE engineHandle,
  _In_ UINT32 id
);
````


## -parameters

### -param engineHandle [in]

A handle for an open session to the filter engine. A callout driver calls the 
     <a href="..\fwpmk\nf-fwpmk-fwpmengineopen0.md">FwpmEngineOpen0</a> function to open a
     session to the filter engine.


### -param id [in]

The run-time identifier for the callout that is being deleted from the filter engine. This must be
     the run-time identifier that was returned when the callout driver called the 
     <a href="..\fwpmk\nf-fwpmk-fwpmcalloutadd0.md">FwpmCalloutAdd0</a> function to add the
     callout to the filter engine.


## -returns
The 
     <b>FwpmCalloutDeleteById0</b> function returns one of the following NTSTATUS codes.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>The callout was successfully deleted from the filter engine.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_FWP_IN_USE</b></dt>
</dl>One or more filters in the filter engine specify the callout for the filter's action.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_FWP_CALLOUT_NOT_FOUND</b></dt>
</dl>There is not a callout in the filter engine that matches the run-time identifier specified in
       the 
       <i>id</i> parameter.
<dl>
<dt><b>Other status codes</b></dt>
</dl>An error occurred.

 


## -remarks
A callout driver calls the 
    <b>FwpmCalloutDeleteById0</b> function to delete a callout from the filter engine, using the run-time
    identifier to identify the callout to be deleted.

Callout drivers do not typically delete their callouts from the filter engine. In most situations, this
    is handled by a user-mode <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/0436f559-20e6-4199-8391-10eb7d85df23">Windows Filtering Platform</a> management application.

A callout can be deleted from the filter engine only if there are no filters in the filter engine that
    specify the callout for the filter's action.
