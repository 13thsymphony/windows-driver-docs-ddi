# NDK_FN_FLUSH callback



## -description
The <i>NdkFlush</i> (<i>NDK_FN_FLUSH</i>) function initiates cancelling of the receive and the initiator queue requests that are currently pending on an NDK queue pair (QP) object.


## -prototype

````
NDK_FN_FLUSH NdkFlush;

VOID NdkFlush(
  _In_ NDK_QP *pNdkQp
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param pNdkQp [in]

A pointer to an NDK queue pair (QP) object (<a href="netvista.ndk_qp">NDK_QP</a>).

## -returns
None

## -remarks
<i>NdkFlush</i> cancels the receive and the initiator queue requests that are currently pending on a QP. The flushed requests have STATUS_CANCELLED as completion status.

If the  NDK consumer wants to verify that all of the requests are flushed after issuing <i>NdkFlush</i>, the consumer must empty the CQ until it sees completions for all requests that were queued prior to calling <i>NdkFlush</i>.
