# NDK_FN_FLUSH callback function
The <i>NdkFlush</i> (<i>NDK_FN_FLUSH</i>) function initiates cancelling of the receive and the initiator queue requests that are currently pending on an NDK queue pair (QP) object.

## Syntax

```
NDK_FN_FLUSH NdkFnFlush;

void NdkFnFlush(
  NDK_QP *pNdkQp
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`*pNdkQp`




## Return Value

None

## Remarks

<i>NdkFlush</i> cancels the receive and the initiator queue requests that are currently pending on a QP. The flushed requests have STATUS_CANCELLED as completion status.

If the  NDK consumer wants to verify that all of the requests are flushed after issuing <i>NdkFlush</i>, the consumer must empty the CQ until it sees completions for all requests that were queued prior to calling <i>NdkFlush</i>.
