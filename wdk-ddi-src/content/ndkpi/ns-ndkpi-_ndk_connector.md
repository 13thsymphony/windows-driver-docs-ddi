# _NDK_CONNECTOR structure
The <b>NDK_CONNECTOR</b> structure specifies the attributes of an NDK connector object.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _NDK_CONNECTOR {
  NDK_OBJECT_HEADER            Header;
  CONST NDK_CONNECTOR_DISPATCH *Dispatch;
} NDK_CONNECTOR, *PNDK_CONNECTOR;
````

## Members


`Dispatch`

A pointer to an <a href="..\ndkpi\ns-ndkpi-_ndk_connector_dispatch.md">NDK_CONNECTOR_DISPATCH</a> structure that defines dispatch functions for the NDK connector object.

`Header`

The <a href="..\ndkpi\ns-ndkpi-_ndk_object_header.md">NDK_OBJECT_HEADER</a> structure for the <b>NDK_CONNECTOR</b> structure. Set the <b>ObjectType</b> member of the structure that <b>Header</b> specifies to <b>NdkObjectTypeConnector</b>.

## Remarks
An NDK provider must set the <b>Dispatch</b> member pointer to its  <a href="..\ndkpi\ns-ndkpi-_ndk_connector_dispatch.md">NDK_CONNECTOR_DISPATCH</a> table before returning the created connector object. The provider must not use the <b>Dispatch</b> member after setting it because the NDK consumer can set the <b>Dispatch</b> member to some other value.

## Requirements
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows version** | None supported,Supported in NDIS 6.30 and later. None supported,Supported in NDIS 6.30 and later. |
