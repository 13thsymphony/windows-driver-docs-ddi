# _NDK_RESULT structure
The <b>NDK_RESULT</b> structure returns the results for an NDK request operation.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _NDK_RESULT {
  NTSTATUS Status;
  ULONG    BytesTransferred;
  PVOID    QPContext;
  PVOID    RequestContext;
} NDK_RESULT;
````

## Members


`BytesTransferred`

The number of bytes transferred. The value of this member  is valid only for <i>NdkReceive</i> (<a href="..\ndkpi\nc-ndkpi-ndk_fn_receive.md">NDK_FN_RECEIVE</a>) request completions. The member is undefined for all other NDK request completions.

`QPContext`

A context value for all requests that are posted over a queue pair (QP). The NDK consumer specified this  pointer when it called the <i>NdkCreateQp</i> (<a href="..\ndkpi\nc-ndkpi-ndk_fn_create_qp.md">NDK_FN_CREATE_QP</a>) function to create the <a href="..\ndkpi\ns-ndkpi-_ndk_qp.md">NDK_QP</a> object.

`RequestContext`

A request context value specified by the NDK consumer when  a request is posted.

`Status`

The NDK request completion status.

## Remarks
The <i>NdkGetCqResults</i> (<a href="..\ndkpi\nc-ndkpi-ndk_fn_get_cq_results.md">NDK_FN_GET_CQ_RESULTS</a>)  function gets an array of <b>NDK_RESULT</b> structures that are filled with completion results that were removed from the CQ.
