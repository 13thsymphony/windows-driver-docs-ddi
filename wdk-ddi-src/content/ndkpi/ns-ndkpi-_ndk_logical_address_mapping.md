# _NDK_LOGICAL_ADDRESS_MAPPING structure
The <b>NDK_LOGICAL_ADDRESS_MAPPING</b> structure contains an array of adapter logical addresses.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct _NDK_LOGICAL_ADDRESS_MAPPING {
  PVOID               AdapterContext;
  ULONG               AdapterPageCount;
  NDK_LOGICAL_ADDRESS AdapterPageArray[1];
} NDK_LOGICAL_ADDRESS_MAPPING;
```

## Members


`AdapterContext`

Reserved for the NDK provider's use. The NDK consumer must not modify this member.

`AdapterPageCount`

The number of entries in the array that is specified in the  <b>AdapterPageArray</b> member.

`AdapterPageArray`

An array of adapter logical addresses. Each logical address in the array corresponds to a page, of <b>PAGE_SIZE</b> bytes in length, and must be <b>PAGE_SIZE</b>-aligned. The array of pages correspond to a virtually contiguous memory region.
The <b>NDK_LOGICAL_ADDRESS</b> datatype is defined as follows:

<pre class="syntax" xml:space="preserve"><code>typedef PHYSICAL_ADDRESS NDK_LOGICAL_ADDRESS;</code></pre>

## Remarks
<b>NDK_LOGICAL_ADDRESS_MAPPING</b> represents an adapter's view of physical memory. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439860">NDK_FN_BUILD_LAM</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439910">NDK_FN_RELEASE_LAM</a> for more information.
