## Members


`Blank`

The blank bit, when set to 1, indicates that the track contains no written data and last recorded address field is invalid. For a complete explanation of the meaning of this bit, see the <i>SCSI Multimedia Commands - 3 (MMC-3)</i> specification.

`Copy`

The copy bit indicates whether the track is a copy or not. If this bit is 1, the track is a copy. If it is 0, the track is not a copy.

`Damage`

The damage bit indicates, together with the NWA_V bit, whether a write to the media is complete or not, and what sort of methods the CD-ROM class driver can use to complete the write. See the <i>SCSI-3 Multi-Media </i>specification for an explanation of how to interpret the values in the <b>Damage</b> and <b>NWA_V</b> members.

`DataMode`

The data mode. This member can have any of the following values:
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<b>Value</b>

</td>
<td>
<b>Meaning</b>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
0x1

</td>
<td>
The track uses data mode 1 (ISO/IEC 10149)

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
0x2

</td>
<td>
The track uses data mode 2 (ISO/IEC 10149 or CD-ROM XA)

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
0xf

</td>
<td>
There is no track descriptor block, and therefore the data block type of the track is unknown.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`FixedPacket`

The fixed packet bit indicates, under some circumstances, when set to 1, that write operations to the track must must use fixed packets. For a complete explanation of the meaning of this bit, see the <i>SCSI Multimedia Commands - 3 (MMC-3)</i> specification.

`FixedPacketSize`

The blocking factor. This value The fixed packet size is valid only when the Packet and the FP bits are both set to one.

`FreeBlocks`

The maximum number of user data blocks that are available for recording in the track.

`LastRecordedAddress`



`Length`

The length, in bytes, of this structure.

`LRA_V`

A boolean value that indicates whether the <b>LastRecordedAddress</b> member is valid or not. If <b>LRA_V</b> is 1, the <b>LastRecordedAddress</b> member is valid. If 0, the <b>LastRecordedAddress</b> member is not valid.

`NextWritableAddress`

The logical block address of the next writable user block in the track specified by the track number (<b>TrackNumberLsb</b> and <b>TrackNumberMsb</b>).

`NWA_V`

A boolean value that indicates, when 1, that the value in <b>NextWritableAddress</b> is valid. If 0, the value in <b>NextWritableAddress</b> is invalid.

`Packet`

The fixed packet bit indicates, under some circumstances, when set to 1, that write operations to the track must must use fixed packets. For a complete explanation of the meaning of this bit, see the <i>SCSI Multimedia Commands - 3 (MMC-3)</i> specification.

`Reserved4`

Reserved.

`Reserved5`

Reserved.

`Reserved6`

Reserved.

`Reserved7`

Reserved7

`ReservedTrack`

The reserved track bit, when 1, indicates that the track is reserved.

`SessionNumberLsb`

The least significant byte of the session number.

`SessionNumberMsb`

The most significant byte of the session number.

`TrackMode`

The track mode. See the <i>SCSI-3 Multi-Media </i>specification for an explanation of meaning of this member.

`TrackNumberLsb`

The least significant byte of the track number.

`TrackNumberMsb`

The most significant byte of the track number.

`TrackSize`

Track Size is the number of user data blocks in the track.

`TrackStartAddress`

The starting address of the specified track.
