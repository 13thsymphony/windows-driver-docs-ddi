# _BIDI_RESPONSE_CONTAINER structure
The BIDI_RESPONSE_CONTAINER structure is a container for a list of bidi responses.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _BIDI_RESPONSE_CONTAINER {
  DWORD              Version;
  DWORD              Flags;
  DWORD              Count;
  BIDI_RESPONSE_DATA aData[1];
} BIDI_RESPONSE_CONTAINER, *PBIDI_RESPONSE_CONTAINER, *LPBIDI_RESPONSE_CONTAINER;
````

## Members


`aData`

Is an array of <a href="..\winspool\ns-winspool-_bidi_response_data.md">BIDI_RESPONSE_DATA</a> structures, each containing a single bidi response.

`Count`

Specifies the number of responses in the <b>aData</b> member.

`Flags`

Is a set of flags reserved for system use. This must be zero.

`Version`

Specifies the version of the bidi API Schema, which is currently 1.

## Remarks
Even though the <b>aData</b> member of this structure is an array with only a single array element, <b>aData</b>[0] should be thought of as the first element of an array of (possibly) an arbitrarily large size.

The spooler's <a href="..\winsplp\nf-winsplp-routerallocbidiresponsecontainer.md">RouterAllocBidiResponseContainer</a> function allocates the memory needed for this structure, which is then used to hold an array of BIDI_RESPONSE_DATA structures. When a BIDI_RESPONSE_CONTAINER structure is no longer needed, it should be freed by a call to <a href="..\winsplp\nf-winsplp-routerfreebidiresponsecontainer.md">RouterFreeBidiResponseContainer</a>.

## Requirements

| **Windows version** | This structure is available in Windows XP and later operating systems. This structure is available in Windows XP and later operating systems. |
