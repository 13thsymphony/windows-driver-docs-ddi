# _BINARY_CONTAINER structure
The BINARY_CONTAINER structure is a container for binary data.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct _BINARY_CONTAINER {
  DWORD  cbBuf;
  LPBYTE pData;
} *PBINARY_CONTAINER, BINARY_CONTAINER;
```

## Members


`cbBuf`

Specifies the number of bytes of binary data in the <b>pData</b> member.

`pData`

Pointer to a buffer that contains the binary data.

## Remarks
The BINARY_CONTAINER structure is used in a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545177">BIDI_DATA</a> structure when the bidi data consists of binary data, as opposed to integer, float, or string data.
