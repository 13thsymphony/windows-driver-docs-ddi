# _BIDI_REQUEST_CONTAINER structure
The BIDI_REQUEST_CONTAINER structure is a container for a list of bidi requests.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _BIDI_REQUEST_CONTAINER {
  DWORD             Version;
  DWORD             Flags;
  DWORD             Count;
  BIDI_REQUEST_DATA aData[1];
} BIDI_REQUEST_CONTAINER, *PBIDI_REQUEST_CONTAINER, *LPBIDI_REQUEST_CONTAINER;
````

## Members


`aData`

Is an array of <a href="..\winspool\ns-winspool-_bidi_request_data.md">BIDI_REQUEST_DATA</a> structures, each holding a single bidi request.

`Count`

Specifies the number of bidi requests in the <b>aData</b> member. A container can contain zero or more requests, although a value of zero is valid only if the action is BIDI_ACTION_ENUM_SCHEMA.

`Flags`

Is a set of flags reserved for system use. This must be zero.

`Version`

Specifies the version of the bidi API Schema, which is currently 1.

## Remarks
Even though the <b>aData</b> member of this structure is an array with only a single array element, <b>aData</b>[0] should be thought of as the first element of an array of (possibly) an arbitrarily large size.

## Requirements
