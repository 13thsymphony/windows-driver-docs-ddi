# IOCTL_VIDEO_SAVE_HARDWARE_STATE IOCTL
Saves the state of the video adapter in the VRP <b>OutputBuffer</b>. Miniport drivers for VGA-compatible adapters are required to support this nonmodal request; optional for other miniport drivers.

### Major Code
[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](xref:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control")

### Input Buffer
None

### Input Buffer Length
<text></text>

### Output Buffer
The miniport driver returns a VIDEO_HARDWARE_STATE structure in the VRP <b>OutputBuffer</b>.

### Output Buffer Length
<text></text>

### Input / Output Buffer

### Input / Output Buffer Length
<text></text>

### Status Block
If the miniport driver successfully saves the adapter state, it sets the <b>Information</b> member of the <a href="..\video\ns-video-_status_block.md">STATUS_BLOCK</a> structure to <b>sizeof</b>(VIDEO_HARDWARE_STATE); otherwise, the miniport driver sets this member to zero.
