# _USB_DEVICE_QUALIFIER_DESCRIPTOR structure



## -description
The <b>USB_DEVICE_QUALIFIER_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure is used by USB client drivers to retrieve a USB-defined device qualifier descriptor.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _USB_DEVICE_QUALIFIER_DESCRIPTOR {
  UCHAR  bLength;
  UCHAR  bDescriptorType;
  USHORT bcdUSB;
  UCHAR  bDeviceClass;
  UCHAR  bDeviceSubClass;
  UCHAR  bDeviceProtocol;
  UCHAR  bMaxPacketSize0;
  UCHAR  bNumConfigurations;
  UCHAR  bReserved;
} USB_DEVICE_QUALIFIER_DESCRIPTOR, *PUSB_DEVICE_QUALIFIER_DESCRIPTOR;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field bLength

Specifies the length, in bytes, of this descriptor.


### -field bDescriptorType

Specifies the descriptor type. Must be set to <b>USB_DEVICE_QUALIFIER_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE</b>.


### -field bcdUSB

Identifies the version of the USB specification that this descriptor structure complies with. This value is a binary-coded decimal number.


### -field bDeviceClass

Specifies the class code of the device as assigned by the USB specification group.


### -field bDeviceSubClass

Specifies the subclass code of the device as assigned by the USB specification group.


### -field bDeviceProtocol

Specifies the protocol code of the device as assigned by the USB specification group.


### -field bMaxPacketSize0

Specifies the maximum packet size, in bytes, for endpoint zero of the device. The value must be set to 8, 16, 32, or 64.


### -field bNumConfigurations

Specifies the total number of possible configurations for the device.


### -field bReserved

Reserved.


## -remarks
This structure is similar to <a href="..\usbspec\ns-usbspec-_usb_device_descriptor.md">USB_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR</a>, but it contains only those members that can change when the device switches from full-speed operation to high-speed operation or vice versa. If the device is operating at full speed, querying for this descriptor will contain information about how the device would operate at high-speed. If, on the other hand, the device is operating at high-speed, this descriptor will contain information about how the device would operate at full-speed.
