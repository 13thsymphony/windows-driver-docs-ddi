# _USB_CONFIGURATION_DESCRIPTOR structure
The  <b>USB_CONFIGURATION_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure is used by USB client drivers to hold a USB-defined configuration descriptor.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _USB_CONFIGURATION_DESCRIPTOR {
  UCHAR  bLength;
  UCHAR  bDescriptorType;
  USHORT wTotalLength;
  UCHAR  bNumInterfaces;
  UCHAR  bConfigurationValue;
  UCHAR  iConfiguration;
  UCHAR  bmAttributes;
  UCHAR  MaxPower;
} USB_CONFIGURATION_DESCRIPTOR, *PUSB_CONFIGURATION_DESCRIPTOR;
````

## Members


`bConfigurationValue`

Contains the value that is used to select a configuration. This value is passed to the USB SetConfiguration request , as described in version 1.1 of the Universal Serial Bus Specification. The port driver does not currently expose a service that allows higher-level drivers to set the configuration.

`bDescriptorType`

Specifies the descriptor type. Must be set to USB_CONFIGURATION_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE.

`bLength`

Specifies the length, in bytes, of this structure.

`bmAttributes`

Specifies a bitmap to describe behavior of this configuration. The bits are described and set in little-endian order.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Bit</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
0 - 4

</td>
<td>
Reserved.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
5

</td>
<td>
The configuration supports remote wakeup.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
6

</td>
<td>
The configuration is self-powered and does not use power from the bus.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
7

</td>
<td>
The configuration is powered by the bus.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`bNumInterfaces`

Specifies the total number of interfaces supported by this configuration.

`iConfiguration`

Specifies the device-defined index of the string descriptor for this configuration.

`MaxPower`

Specifies the power requirements of this device in two-milliampere units. This member is valid only if bit seven is set in <b>bmAttributes</b>.

`wTotalLength`

Specifies the total length, in bytes, of all data for the configuration. The length includes all interface, endpoint, class, or vendor-specific descriptors that are returned with the configuration descriptor.

## Remarks
If <b>wTotalLength</b> is greater than the buffer size provided in the URB to hold all descriptors retrieved (interface, endpoint, class, and vendor-defined), incomplete data will be returned. In order to retrieve complete descriptors, the request will need to be re-sent with a larger buffer.

If <b>bmAttributes</b> bits six and seven are both set, then the device is powered both by the bus and by a source external to the bus.

Other members that are part of this structure but not described here should be treated as opaque and considered to be reserved for system use.
