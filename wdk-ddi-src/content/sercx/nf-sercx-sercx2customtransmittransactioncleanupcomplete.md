# SerCx2CustomTransmitTransactionCleanupComplete function
The <b>SerCx2CustomTransmitTransactionCleanupComplete</b> method notifies version 2 of the serial framework extension (SerCx2) that the serial controller driver has finished cleaning up the serial controller's hardware state after a custom-transmit transaction.

## Syntax

````
VOID SerCx2CustomTransmitTransactionCleanupComplete(
  [in] SERCX2CUSTOMTRANSMITTRANSACTION CustomTransmitTransaction
);
````

## Parameters

`CustomTransmitTransaction`

A <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn265257">SERCX2CUSTOMTRANSMITTRANSACTION</a> handle to a custom-transmit object. The serial controller driver previously called the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx2customtransmittransactioncreate.md">SerCx2CustomTransmitTransactionCreate</a> method to create this object.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

After a custom-transmit transaction ends, SerCx2 calls the <a href="..\sercx\nc-sercx-evt_sercx2_custom_transmit_transaction_cleanup.md">EvtSerCx2CustomTransmitTransactionCleanup</a> event callback function, if it is implemented, to clean up the serial controller state. In response to this call, the driver should first do any clean-up work that is needed; then the driver must call <b>SerCx2CustomTransmitTransactionCleanupComplete</b> to notify SerCx2. SerCx2 expects this notification and does not start the next transaction until it is notified.

A serial controller driver must call <b>SerCx2CustomTransmitTransactionCleanupComplete</b> only in response to a call to the <i>EvtSerCx2CustomTransmitTransactionCleanup</i> function.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/E72E68BC-A60A-41BE-8606-92A608648042">SerCx2 Custom-Transmit Transactions</a>.
