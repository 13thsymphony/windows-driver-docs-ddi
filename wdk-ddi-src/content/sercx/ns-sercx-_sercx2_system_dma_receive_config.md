## Members


`DeviceAddress`

The translated address from which the DMA controller transfers. For more information, see the description of the <b>DeviceAddress</b> member in <a href="..\wdfdmaenabler\ns-wdfdmaenabler-_wdf_dma_system_profile_config.md">WDF_DMA_SYSTEM_PROFILE_CONFIG</a>.

`DmaAlignment`

DMA alignment requirement. Specifies how the starting address of a transfer in a system-DMA-receive transaction must be aligned in memory. Set this member to the appropriate FILE_<i>XXX</i>_ALIGNMENT constant in the Wdm.h header file. For example, FILE_WORD_ALIGNMENT indicates that the starting DMA address must be aligned to two-byte boundary in memory, FILE_LONG_ALIGNMENT indicates that the address must be aligned to a four-byte boundary, and so on. SerCx2 does not support FILE_BYTE_ALIGNMENT. The minimum transfer unit (MTU) of the system DMA adapter should be greater than or equal to the required alignment. For example, if the MTU is four bytes, <b>DmaAlignment</b> must be at least FILE_LONG_ALIGNMENT.

`DmaDescriptor`

A pointer to the <a href="..\wudfwdm\ns-wudfwdm-_cm_partial_resource_descriptor.md">CM_PARTIAL_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</a> structure that describes the system DMA resource to use for receive transactions. The serial controller driver gets this structure from the raw resource list it receives in the <a href="..\wdfdevice\nc-wdfdevice-evt_wdf_device_prepare_hardware.md">EvtDevicePrepareHardware</a> callback that starts the serial controller.

`DmaWidth`

The width of the data register at the address specified by <b>DeviceAddress</b>. Possible values are <b>Width8Bits</b>, <b>Width16Bits</b>, <b>Width32Bits</b>, and <b>Width64Bits</b>.

`EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCancelNewDataNotification`

A pointer to the driver-implemented <a href="..\sercx\nc-sercx-evt_sercx2_system_dma_receive_cancel_new_data_notification.md">EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCancelNewDataNotification</a> event callback function. This member is optional and can be set to <b>NULL</b> to indicate that the driver does not implement the function. However, a driver that implements this function must also implement an <i>EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveEnableNewDataNotification</i> function.

`EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCleanupTransaction`

A pointer to the driver-implemented <a href="..\sercx\nc-sercx-evt_sercx2_system_dma_receive_cleanup_transaction.md">EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCleanupTransaction</a> event callback function. This member is optional and can be set to <b>NULL</b> to indicate that the driver does not implement the function.

`EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveConfigureDmaChannel`

A pointer to the driver-implemented <a href="..\sercx\nc-sercx-evt_sercx2_system_dma_receive_configure_dma_channel.md">EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveConfigureDmaChannel</a> event callback function. This member is optional and can be set to <b>NULL</b> to indicate that the driver does not implement the function.

`EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveEnableNewDataNotification`

A pointer to the driver-implemented <a href="..\sercx\nc-sercx-evt_sercx2_system_dma_receive_enable_new_data_notification.md">EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveEnableNewDataNotification</a> event callback function. This member is optional and can be set to <b>NULL</b> to indicate that the driver does not implement the function. However, a driver that implements this function must also implement an <i>EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCancelNewDataNotification</i> function.

`EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveInitializeTransaction`

A pointer to the driver-implemented <a href="..\sercx\nc-sercx-evt_sercx2_system_dma_receive_initialize_transaction.md">EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveInitializeTransaction</a> event callback function. This member is optional and can be set to <b>NULL</b> to indicate that the driver does not implement the function.

`Exclusive`

Whether to use system-DMA-receive transactions exclusively to handle write (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549327">IRP_MJ_READ</a>) requests. Set to <b>TRUE</b> to indicate that read requests should use system-DMA-receive transactions exclusively. Set to <b>FALSE</b> to indicate that read requests can use a combination of system-DMA-receive transactions and PIO-receive transactions.

Set this member to <b>TRUE</b> only if the minimum transfer unit for system-DMA-receive transactions is one byte, the minimum transaction length is one byte, and the read buffer for the transaction can start on any byte boundary in memory.

If <b>Exclusive</b> is <b>TRUE</b>, the <b>MinimumTransferUnitOverride</b>, <b>DmaAlignment</b>, and <b>MinimumTransactionLength</b> members must be zero.

Regardless of the value of this member, PIO-receive transactions are used to save any unread data in the receive FIFO before the serial controller exits the D0 device power state to enter a low-power state.

`MaximumScatterGatherFragments`

The maximum number of buffer fragments that can be specified in the scatter/gather list for a DMA transfer in a system-DMA-receive transaction.

`MaximumTransferLength`

The default maximum size, in bytes, that the serial controller can handle in a single system DMA transfer. If the size of the buffer in the read (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549327">IRP_MJ_READ</a>) request is larger than this maximum size, SerCx2 uses multiple DMA transfers to handle the request, and limits each transfer to the maximum length.

`MinimumTransactionLength`

The minimum length, in bytes, of a system-DMA-receive transaction. If the length of the buffer in a read request is less than this minimum length, SerCx2 uses programmed I/O (PIO) for the transaction.

`MinimumTransferUnitOverride`

An override value to use in place of the default minimum transfer unit. The number of bytes specified by an element in a scatter/gather list must be an integer multiple of the minimum transfer unit. A value of zero indicates that the default minimum transfer unit should be used. For more information, see the description of the <b>MinimumTransferUnit</b> member in <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_dma_adapter_info_v1.md">DMA_ADAPTER_INFO_V1</a>.

`Size`

The size, in bytes, of this structure. The <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx2systemdmareceivecreate.md">SerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCreate</a> method uses this member to determine which version of the structure the caller is using. The size of this structure might change in future versions of the Sercx.h header file.

## Remarks
The <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx2systemdmareceivecreate.md">SerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCreate</a> method accepts a pointer to a <b>SERCX2_SYSTEM_DMA_RECEIVE_CONFIG</b> structure as an input parameter. Before calling <b>SerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCreate</b>, call the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx2_system_dma_receive_config_init.md">SERCX2_SYSTEM_DMA_RECEIVE_CONFIG_INIT</a> or <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx2_system_dma_receive_config_init_new_data_notification.md">SERCX2_SYSTEM_DMA_RECEIVE_CONFIG_INIT_NEW_DATA_NOTIFICATION</a> function to initialize this structure.
