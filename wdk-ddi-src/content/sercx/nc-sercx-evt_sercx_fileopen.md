# EVT_SERCX_FILEOPEN function
The <i>EvtSerCxFileOpen</i> event callback function notifies the serial controller driver that a client opened a file handle on the serial controller device and that a file object has been created to represent the device.

## Syntax

```
EVT_SERCX_FILEOPEN EvtSercxFileopen;

NTSTATUS EvtSercxFileopen(
  WDFDEVICE Device
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Device`

A WDFDEVICE handle to the framework device object that represents the serial controller.


## Return Value

The <i>EvtSerCxFileOpen</i> function returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call is successful. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate error status code.

## Remarks

The serial framework extension (SerCx) calls this function to prepare the serial controller hardware to accept requests for I/O operations. This function should configure the controller in a state in which it is ready to receive and transmit data. If interrupts are required, this function should enable interrupts. In addition, this function should allocate any memory that is required only during the lifetime of the file object. For example, this function can allocate an interrupt data buffer.

To register an <i>EvtSerCxFileOpen</i> callback function, the driver must call the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercxinitialize.md">SerCxInitialize</a> method.
