# SerCx2CustomReceiveTransactionNewDataNotification function
The <b>SerCx2CustomReceiveTransactionNewDataNotification</b> method notifies version 2 of the serial framework extension (SerCx2) that data is available to be read from the receive FIFO in the serial controller hardware.

## Syntax

````
VOID SerCx2CustomReceiveTransactionNewDataNotification(
  [in] SERCX2CUSTOMRECEIVETRANSACTION CustomReceiveTransaction
);
````

## Parameters

`CustomReceiveTransaction`

A <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn265249">SERCX2CUSTOMRECEIVETRANSACTION</a> handle to a custom-receive object. The serial controller driver previously called the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx2customreceivetransactioncreate.md">SerCx2CustomReceiveTransactionCreate</a> method to create this object.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

If the receive FIFO in the serial controller becomes empty before a custom-receive transaction can be completed, SerCx2 calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/C3E446AB-17AA-4FD8-8245-16D95134B0E7">EvtSerCx2CustomReceiveTransactionEnableNewDataNotification</a> event callback function, if it is implemented, to enable a new-data notification to occur when new data is available to be read from the receive FIFO.

If new-data notifications are enabled and new data is available to be read, the serial controller driver must call <b>SerCx2CustomReceiveTransactionNewDataNotification</b> to notify SerCx2. This notification occurs when the driver detects that one or more new bytes of received data either are ready to be transferred by the custom data-transfer mechanism or have already been transferred by this mechanism.

The serial controller driver must call <b>SerCx2CustomReceiveTransactionNewDataNotification</b> only in response to a call to the <i>EvtSerCx2CustomReceiveTransactionEnableNewDataNotification</i> function.

If a serial controller driver supports new-data notifications for custom-receive transactions, SerCx uses these notifications to detect interval time-outs during the handling of read (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549327">IRP_MJ_READ</a>) requests. For more information about interval time-outs, see <a href="..\ntddser\ns-ntddser-_serial_timeouts.md">SERIAL_TIMEOUTS</a>. For more information about new-data notifications, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/29849A8C-6656-444C-BE91-405A4BA2D5B0">SerCx2 Custom-Receive Transactions</a>.
