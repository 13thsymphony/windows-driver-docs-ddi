# SerCxGetReadIntervalTimeout function
The <b>SerCxGetReadIntervalTimeout</b> method returns the interval time-out value for a read (receive) operation.

## Syntax

````
ULONG SerCxGetReadIntervalTimeout(
  [in] WDFDEVICE Device
);
````

## Parameters

`Device`

A WDFDEVICE handle to the framework device object that represents the serial controller.


## Return Value

<b>SerCxGetReadIntervalTimeout</b> returns the read-interval time-out value in milliseconds. A value of zero indicates that read-interval time-outs are not used.

## Remarks

The read-interval time-out value is the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, that is allowed between two consecutive bytes in a read operation. A read operation that exceeds this maximum times out. For more information about time-out values, see <a href="..\ntddser\ns-ntddser-_serial_timeouts.md">SERIAL_TIMEOUTS</a>.

A read (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549327">IRP_MJ_READ</a>) request successfully completes when the requested read operation times out. The request returns the <b>STATUS_TIMEOUT</b> status code to indicate that the operation timed out.
