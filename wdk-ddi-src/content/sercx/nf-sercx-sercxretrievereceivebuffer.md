# SerCxRetrieveReceiveBuffer function
The <b>SerCxRetrieveReceiveBuffer</b> method obtains an input buffer into which data received from the serial port can be loaded.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS SerCxRetrieveReceiveBuffer(
  [in]      WDFDEVICE                Device,
  [in]      ULONG                    Length,
  [in, out] PSERCX_BUFFER_DESCRIPTOR BufferDescriptor
);
````

## Parameters

`Device`

A WDFDEVICE handle to the framework device object that represents the serial controller.

`Length`

The requested buffer length, in bytes. If the <b>SerCxRetrieveReceiveBuffer</b> call succeeds, the caller receives an input buffer that contains up to <i>Length</i> bytes of available space. (The available space in the buffer might be less than <i>Length</i> bytes.) <b>SerCxRetrieveReceiveBuffer</b> writes the actual number of bytes of available space to the <b>Length</b> member of the structure pointed to by the <i>BufferDescriptor</i> parameter.

`BufferDescriptor`

A pointer to a caller-allocated <a href="..\sercx\ns-sercx-sercx_buffer_descriptor.md">SERCX_BUFFER_DESCRIPTOR</a> structure. This structure describes the data buffer to use for the receive operation. The caller previously called the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx_buffer_descriptor_init.md">SERCX_BUFFER_DESCRIPTOR_INIT</a> function to initialize this structure. <b>SerCxRetrieveTransmitBuffer</b> writes to the <b>Buffer</b> and <b>Length</b> members of this structure.


## Return Value

<b>SerCxRetrieveReceiveBuffer</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if it is successful. Possible error return values include the following status codes.

<td width="60%">
The method was called at the wrong IRQL; or the WDFDEVICE handle is not valid; or either <i>Device</i> or <i>BufferDescriptor</i> is NULL; or the driver already has a receive buffer.

<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INFO_LENGTH_MISMATCH</b></dt>

</td>
<td width="60%">
The wrong size is specified for the <b>SERCX_BUFFER_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure.

<td width="60%">
Could not allocate system resources (typically memory).

## Remarks

The serial controller driver calls this method to acquire a buffer to contain input data from the current receive (read) operation.
