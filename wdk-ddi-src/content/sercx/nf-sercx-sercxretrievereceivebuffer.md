# SerCxRetrieveReceiveBuffer function



## -description
The <b>SerCxRetrieveReceiveBuffer</b> method obtains an input buffer into which data received from the serial port can be loaded.



## -syntax

````
NTSTATUS SerCxRetrieveReceiveBuffer(
  [in]      WDFDEVICE                Device,
  [in]      ULONG                    Length,
  [in, out] PSERCX_BUFFER_DESCRIPTOR BufferDescriptor
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Device [in]

A WDFDEVICE handle to the framework device object that represents the serial controller.


### -param Length [in]

The requested buffer length, in bytes. If the <b>SerCxRetrieveReceiveBuffer</b> call succeeds, the caller receives an input buffer that contains up to <i>Length</i> bytes of available space. (The available space in the buffer might be less than <i>Length</i> bytes.) <b>SerCxRetrieveReceiveBuffer</b> writes the actual number of bytes of available space to the <b>Length</b> member of the structure pointed to by the <i>BufferDescriptor</i> parameter.


### -param BufferDescriptor [in, out]

A pointer to a caller-allocated <a href="..\sercx\ns-sercx-sercx_buffer_descriptor.md">SERCX_BUFFER_DESCRIPTOR</a> structure. This structure describes the data buffer to use for the receive operation. The caller previously called the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx_buffer_descriptor_init.md">SERCX_BUFFER_DESCRIPTOR_INIT</a> function to initialize this structure. <b>SerCxRetrieveTransmitBuffer</b> writes to the <b>Buffer</b> and <b>Length</b> members of this structure.


## -returns
<b>SerCxRetrieveReceiveBuffer</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if it is successful. Possible error return values include the following status codes.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_REQUEST</b></dt>
</dl>The method was called at the wrong IRQL; or the WDFDEVICE handle is not valid; or either <i>Device</i> or <i>BufferDescriptor</i> is NULL; or the driver already has a receive buffer.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INFO_LENGTH_MISMATCH</b></dt>
</dl>The wrong size is specified for the <b>SERCX_BUFFER_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES</b></dt>
</dl>Could not allocate system resources (typically memory).

 


## -remarks
The serial controller driver calls this method to acquire a buffer to contain input data from the current receive (read) operation.
