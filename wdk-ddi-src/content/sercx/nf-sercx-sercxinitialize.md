# SerCxInitialize function
The <b>SerCxInitialize</b> method completes the initialization of the serial framework extension (SerCx) after this driver creates the associated device object.

## Syntax

```
NTSTATUS SerCxInitialize(
  WDFDEVICE     FxDevice,
  PSERCX_CONFIG Config
);
```

## Parameters

`FxDevice`

A WDFDEVICE handle to the framework device object that represents the serial controller.

`Config`

A pointer to a caller-allocated <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439548">SERCX_CONFIG</a> structure that contains configuration information for SerCx. The caller previously called the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439553">SERCX_CONFIG_INIT</a> function to initialize this structure.


## Return Value

<b>SerCxInitialize</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if it is successful. Possible error return values include the following status codes.

<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_REQUEST</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The method was called at the wrong IRQL; or the WDFDEVICE handle is not valid; or either <i>FxDevice</i> or <i>Config</i> is NULL.

<dt><b>STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Could not allocate system resources (typically memory).

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

The serial controller driver calls this method after it creates the associated device object.

<b>SerCxInitialize</b> registers the controller driver’s I/O callback functions with SerCx. In addition, this method defines the transfer mode for the I/O queue.  During the call, this method creates all of the internal structures required by SerCx (including the I/O queue for the serial controller).  After this method returns, SerCx is ready to process I/O.  However, the controller driver might configure controller hardware settings before it returns from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b20db029-ee2c-4fb1-bd69-ccd2e37fdc9a">EvtDriverDeviceAdd</a> callback or before it adds the PDO to the child list.

If the parameters are invalid (as described in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439548">SERCX_CONFIG</a>), <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557262">Driver Verifier</a> will raise an error.

This routine must be called before committing the device (returning from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b20db029-ee2c-4fb1-bd69-ccd2e37fdc9a">EvtDriverDeviceAdd</a> or adding the PDO to the child list).
