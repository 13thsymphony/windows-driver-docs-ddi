# EVT_SERCX2_FILEOPEN function
The <i>EvtSerCx2FileOpen</i> event callback function is called by version 2 of the serial framework extension (SerCx2) to notify the serial controller driver that a client opened a logical connection to the serial controller device and that a file object has been created to represent this connection.

## Syntax

```
EVT_SERCX2_FILEOPEN EvtSercx2Fileopen;

NTSTATUS EvtSercx2Fileopen(
  WDFDEVICE Device
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Device`

A WDFDEVICE handle to the framework device object that represents the serial controller. The serial controller driver created this object in its <a href="..\wdfdriver\nc-wdfdriver-evt_wdf_driver_device_add.md">EvtDriverDeviceAdd</a> callback function. For more information, see <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx2initializedevice.md">SerCx2InitializeDevice</a>.


## Return Value

The <i>EvtSerCx2FileOpen</i> function returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call is successful. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate error status code.

## Remarks

Your serial controller driver can, as an option, implement this function. If implemented, the driver registers this function in the call to the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx2initializedevice.md">SerCx2InitializeDevice</a> method that finishes the initialization of the framework device object for the serial controller. SerCx2 calls the <i>EvtSerCx2FileOpen</i> function when a client driver opens a file handle to the serial controller driver stack.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/93ec5dd7-8ef0-4cea-9253-ea5d7869d4b8">Framework File Objects</a>.
