# EVT_SERCX_CONTROL function



## -description
The <i>EvtSerCxControl</i> event callback function handles an I/O control request that has an I/O control code (IOCTL) that the serial framework extension (SerCx) supports.



## -syntax

````
EVT_SERCX_CONTROL EvtSerCxControl;

NTSTATUS EvtSerCxControl(
  _In_ WDFDEVICE  Device,
  _In_ WDFREQUEST Request,
  _In_ size_t     OutputBufferLength,
  _In_ size_t     InputBufferLength,
  _In_ ULONG      IoControlCode
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param Device [in]

A WDFDEVICE handle to the framework device object that represents the serial controller.


### -param Request [in]

A WDFREQUEST handle to the framework request object that represents the I/O control request.


### -param OutputBufferLength [in]

Specifies the length, in bytes, of the output buffer for the I/O control request specified by the <i>Request</i> parameter.


### -param InputBufferLength [in]

Specifies the length, in bytes, of the input buffer for the I/O control request specified by the <i>Request</i> parameter.


### -param IoControlCode [in]

Specifies the IOCTL from the I/O control request specified by the <i>Request</i> parameter.


## -returns
The <i>EvtSerCxControl</i> function returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call is successful. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate error status code. For more information, see the following Remarks section.


## -remarks
The serial controller driver is required to implement this callback function. SerCx calls this function to hand off an I/O control request to the controller driver for processing. Before this function returns, it must complete the request either by performing the requested operation or by returning an error status. A driver that does not implement support for a particular request should return the STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED error status for this request.

Typically, the <i>EvtSerCxControl</i> function should synchronize to the controller driver's ISR before this function changes the settings in the hardware registers of the serial controller.

The <i>EvtSerCxControl</i> function's return value must match the status value that this function writes to the status block of the I/O control request. SerCx uses the return value to track the state of the controller driver and the serial controller hardware.

The following is a list of the IOCTLs that this callback function must be prepared to handle:

To register an <i>EvtSerCxControl</i> callback function, the controller driver calls the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercxinitialize.md">SerCxInitialize</a> method during the <a href="..\wdfdriver\nc-wdfdriver-evt_wdf_driver_device_add.md">EvtDriverDeviceAdd</a> callback.

The function type for this callback is declared in Sercx.h, as follows.

To define an <i>EvtSerCxControl</i> callback function that is named <code>MyEvtSerCxControl</code>, you must first provide a function declaration that <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/74feeb16-387c-4796-987a-aff3fb79b556">Static Driver Verifier</a> (SDV) and other verification tools require, as follows.

Then, implement your callback function as follows.

For more information about SDV requirements for function declarations, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/73a408ba-0219-4fde-8dad-ca330e4e67c3">Declaring Functions Using Function Role Types for KMDF Drivers</a>.
