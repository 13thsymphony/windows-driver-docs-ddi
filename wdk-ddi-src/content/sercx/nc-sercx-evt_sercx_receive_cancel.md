# EVT_SERCX_RECEIVE_CANCEL function
The <i>EvtSerCxReceiveCancel</i> event callback function notifies the serial controller driver that the pending receive request is canceled.

## Syntax

```
EVT_SERCX_RECEIVE_CANCEL EvtSercxReceiveCancel;

void EvtSercxReceiveCancel(
  WDFDEVICE Device
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Device`

A WDFDEVICE handle to the framework device object that represents the serial controller.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

The serial framework extension (SerCx) calls this function to inform the serial controller driver that the current receive request has been canceled.  If the driver has an outstanding receive operation in progress, the driver should cancel this operation and call the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercxprogressreceive.md">SerCxProgressReceive</a> method to report the cancellation. In the <b>SerCxProgressReceive</b> call, set <i>BytesReceived</i> to the number of bytes received before the operation was canceled, and set <i>ReceiveStatus</i> to <b>SerCxStatusCancelled</b>.

To register an <i>EvtSerCxReceiveCancel</i> callback function, the driver must call the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercxinitialize.md">SerCxInitialize</a> method.
