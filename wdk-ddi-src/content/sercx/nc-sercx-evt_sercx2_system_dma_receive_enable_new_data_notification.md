# EVT_SERCX2_SYSTEM_DMA_RECEIVE_ENABLE_NEW_DATA_NOTIFICATION function
The <i>EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveEnableNewDataNotification</i> event callback function is called by version 2 of the serial framework extension (SerCx2) to enable the serial controller driver to notify SerCx2 when the serial controller receives new data.

## Syntax

```
EVT_SERCX2_SYSTEM_DMA_RECEIVE_ENABLE_NEW_DATA_NOTIFICATION EvtSercx2SystemDmaReceiveEnableNewDataNotification;

void EvtSercx2SystemDmaReceiveEnableNewDataNotification(
  SERCX2SYSTEMDMARECEIVE SystemDmaReceive
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`SystemDmaReceive`

A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/serports/sercx2-object-handles">SERCX2SYSTEMDMARECEIVE</a> handle to a system-DMA-receive object. The serial controller driver previously called the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx2systemdmareceivecreate.md">SerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCreate</a> method to create this object.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

Your serial controller driver can, as an option, implement this function. If implemented, the driver registers the function in the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx2systemdmareceivecreate.md">SerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCreate</a> call that creates the system-DMA-receive object.

After the <i>EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveEnableNewDataNotification</i> function is called to enable a new-data notification for a system-DMA-receive transaction, the serial controller driver must call the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx2systemdmareceivenewdatanotification.md">SerCx2SystemDmaReceiveNewDataNotification</a> method to notify SerCx2 when the driver detects that one or more bytes of received data either are ready to be transferred or have already been transferred by the system DMA controller.

The new-data notification enabled by the <i>EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveEnableNewDataNotification</i> function is a one-shot notification. After this function is called and the serial controller driver sends a new-data notification to SerCx2, no further notification is sent until SerCx2 calls the function again to enable another notification.

The <i>EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveEnableNewDataNotification</i> function typically enables an interrupt to be triggered when the serial controller receives data from the peripheral device.

No more than one new-data notification can be pending at a time. After SerCx2 calls the <i>EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveEnableNewDataNotification</i> function to enable a new-data notification, SerCx2 does not call this function again until the controller driver calls <b>SerCx2SystemDmaReceiveNewDataNotification</b>.

A pending new-data notification can be canceled if the associated read request times out or is canceled. To cancel a new-data notification for a system-DMA-receive transaction, SerCx2 calls the <a href="..\sercx\nc-sercx-evt_sercx2_system_dma_receive_cancel_new_data_notification.md">EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCancelNewDataNotification</a> event callback function. A driver that implements an <i>EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveEnableNewDataNotification</i> function must also implement an <i>EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCancelNewDataNotification</i> function.

SerCx2 uses new-data notifications to efficiently manage interval time-outs that occur during the handling of read requests that are processed as system-DMA-receive transactions.
