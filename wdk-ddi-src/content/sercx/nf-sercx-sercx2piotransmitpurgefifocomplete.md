# SerCx2PioTransmitPurgeFifoComplete function
The <b>SerCx2PioTransmitPurgeFifoComplete</b> method notifies version 2 of the serial framework extension (SerCx2) that the serial controller driver has finished purging the data from the transmit FIFO in the serial controller hardware.

## Syntax

````
VOID SerCx2PioTransmitPurgeFifoComplete(
  [in] SERCX2PIOTRANSMIT PioTransmit,
  [in] ULONG             BytesPurged
);
````

## Parameters

`PioTransmit`

A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/serports/sercx2-object-handles">SERCX2PIOTRANSMIT</a> handle to a PIO-transmit object. The serial controller driver previously called the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx2piotransmitcreate.md">SerCx2PioTransmitCreate</a> method to create this object.

`BytesPurged`

The number of bytes of unsent data that the serial controller driver purged from the transmit FIFO.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

SerCx2 calls the <a href="..\sercx\nc-sercx-evt_sercx2_pio_transmit_purge_fifo.md">EvtSerCx2PioTransmitPurgeFifo</a> event callback function, if it is implemented, to end the current PIO-transmit transaction. SerCx2 previously initiated this transaction in response to a write (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550819">IRP_MJ_WRITE</a>) request from a client. For example, SerCx2 might call this function if the client cancels the pending write request, or the write request times out. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/98100680-7D27-42B7-A445-C539B2DF95AD">SerCx2 Handling of Read and Write Requests</a>.

In response to the <i>EvtSerCx2PioTransmitPurgeFifo</i> function call, the driver first discards any data that remains in the transmit FIFO; then the driver must call <b>SerCx2PioTransmitPurgeFifoComplete</b> to notify SerCx2. SerCx2 expects this notification and does not complete the write request until it is notified.

The serial controller driver must call <b>SerCx2PioTransmitPurgeFifoComplete</b> only in response to a call to the <i>EvtSerCx2PioTransmitPurgeFifo</i> function.

SerCx2 uses the <i>BytesPurged</i> parameter value to determine how many bytes were successfully transmitted before the transmit FIFO was purged. SerCx2 requires this information to complete a write request that times out, or a write request that is canceled after one or more bytes are transmitted.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3BEF9A3D-1FEF-4626-B07F-1670359062AF">SerCx2 PIO-Transmit Transactions</a>.
