# EVT_SERCX2_FILECLOSE function
The <i>EvtSerCx2FileClose</i> event callback function is called by version 2 of the serial framework extension (SerCx2) to notify the serial controller driver that the client released the file object that represents the logical connection to the serial controller device.

## Syntax

```
EVT_SERCX2_FILECLOSE EvtSercx2Fileclose;

void EvtSercx2Fileclose(
  WDFDEVICE Device
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Device`

A WDFDEVICE handle to the framework device object that represents the serial controller. The serial controller driver created this object in its <a href="..\wdfdriver\nc-wdfdriver-evt_wdf_driver_device_add.md">EvtDriverDeviceAdd</a> callback function. For more information, see <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx2initializedevice.md">SerCx2InitializeDevice</a>.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

Your serial controller driver can, as an option, implement this function. If implemented, the driver registers this function in the call to the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx2initializedevice.md">SerCx2InitializeDevice</a> method that finishes the initialization of the framework device object for the serial controller.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/93ec5dd7-8ef0-4cea-9253-ea5d7869d4b8">Framework File Objects</a>.
