# SerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCleanupTransactionComplete function



## -description
The <b>SerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCleanupTransactionComplete</b> method notifies version 2 of the serial framework extension (SerCx2) that the serial controller driver has finished cleaning up the serial controller's hardware state after a system-DMA-receive transaction.



## -syntax

````
VOID SerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCleanupTransactionComplete(
  [in] SERCX2SYSTEMDMARECEIVE SystemDmaReceive
);
````


## -parameters

### -param SystemDmaReceive [in]

A <a href="serports.sercx2systemdmareceive_object_handle">SERCX2SYSTEMDMARECEIVE</a> handle to a system-DMA-receive object. The serial controller driver previously called the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx2systemdmareceivecreate.md">SerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCreate</a> method to create this object.


## -returns
None.


## -remarks
After a system-DMA-receive transaction ends, SerCx2 calls the <a href="..\sercx\nc-sercx-evt_sercx2_system_dma_receive_cleanup_transaction.md">EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCleanupTransaction</a> event callback function, if it is implemented, to clean up the serial controller state. In response to this call, the driver should do any clean-up work that is needed; then the driver must call <b>SerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCleanupTransactionComplete</b> to notify SerCx2. SerCx2 expects this notification and does not start the next transaction until it is notified.

The serial controller driver must call <b>SerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCleanupTransactionComplete</b> only in response to a call to the <i>EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCleanupTransaction</i> function.
