# EVT_SERCX2_CUSTOM_TRANSMIT_TRANSACTION_CLEANUP function
The <i>EvtSerCx2CustomTransmitTransactionCleanup</i> event callback function  is called by version 2 of the serial framework extension (SerCx2) to clean up the serial controller's hardware state after a custom-transmit transaction ends.

## Syntax

```
EVT_SERCX2_CUSTOM_TRANSMIT_TRANSACTION_CLEANUP EvtSercx2CustomTransmitTransactionCleanup;

void EvtSercx2CustomTransmitTransactionCleanup(
  SERCX2CUSTOMTRANSMITTRANSACTION CustomTransmitTransaction
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`CustomTransmitTransaction`

A <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn265257">SERCX2CUSTOMTRANSMITTRANSACTION</a> handle to a custom-transmit object. The serial controller driver previously called the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx2customtransmittransactioncreate.md">SerCx2CustomTransmitTransactionCreate</a> method to create this object.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

Your serial controller driver can, as an option, implement this function. If implemented, the driver registers the function in the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx2customtransmittransactioncreate.md">SerCx2CustomTransmitTransactionCreate</a> call that creates the custom-transmit object.

Your serial controller driver should implement an <i>EvtSerCx2CustomTransmitTransactionCleanup</i> function if it needs to clean up the serial controller state at the end of a custom-transmit transaction. SerCx2 calls this function, if it is implemented, after a custom-transmit transaction ends. In response to the <i>EvtSerCx2CustomTransmitTransactionCleanup</i> call, the serial controller driver must call the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx2customtransmittransactioncleanupcomplete.md">SerCx2CustomTransmitTransactionCleanupComplete</a> method to notify SerCx2 after the clean-up work is done.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/E72E68BC-A60A-41BE-8606-92A608648042">SerCx2 Custom-Transmit Transactions</a>.
