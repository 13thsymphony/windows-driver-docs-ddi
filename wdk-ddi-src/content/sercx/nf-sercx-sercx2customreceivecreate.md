# SerCx2CustomReceiveCreate function



## -description
The <b>SerCx2CustomReceiveCreate</b> method creates a custom-receive object, which version 2 of the serial framework extension (SerCx2) uses to read receive data from the serial controller by means of a custom data-transfer mechanism.


## -syntax

````
NTSTATUS SerCx2CustomReceiveCreate(
  [in]  WDFDEVICE                     Device,
  [in]  PSERCX2_CUSTOM_RECEIVE_CONFIG CustomReceiveConfig,
  [in]  PWDF_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES        Attributes,
  [out] SERCX2CUSTOMRECEIVE           *CustomReceive
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Device [in]

A WDFDEVICE handle to the framework device object that represents the serial controller. The serial controller driver created this object in its <a href="..\wdfdriver\nc-wdfdriver-evt_wdf_driver_device_add.md">EvtDriverDeviceAdd</a> callback function. For more information, see <a href="serports.sercx2initializedevice">SerCx2InitializeDevice</a>.

### -param CustomReceiveConfig [in]

A pointer to a <a href="serports.sercx2_custom_receive_config">SERCX2_CUSTOM_RECEIVE_CONFIG</a> structure. Before calling this method, the caller must call the <a href="serports.sercx2_custom_receive_config_init">SERCX2_CUSTOM_RECEIVE_CONFIG_INIT</a> function to initialize the structure. This structure contains pointers to a set of event callback routines that are implemented by the serial controller driver. SerCx2 calls these functions to perform custom-receive transactions.

### -param Attributes [in]

A pointer to a <a href="kmdf.wdf_object_attributes">WDF_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES</a> structure that describes the attributes to assign to the new custom-receive object. Before calling this method, the caller must call the <a href="kmdf.wdf_object_attributes_init">WDF_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES_INIT</a> function to initialize the structure. This parameter is optional and can be specified as WDF_NO_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES if the serial controller driver does not need to assign attributes to the object. For more information, see Remarks.

### -param CustomReceive [out]

A pointer to a location to which this method writes a <a href="serports.sercx2customreceive">SERCX2CUSTOMRECEIVE</a> handle to the newly created custom-receive object. SerCx2 and the serial controller driver use this handle in subsequent calls to refer to this object.

## -returns
This method returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call is successful. Possible error return values include the following status codes.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_REQUEST</b></dt>
</dl>A custom-receive object already exists from a previous <b>SerCx2CustomReceiveCreate</b> call; or a system-DMA-receive object exists from a previous <a href="serports.sercx2systemdmareceivecreate">SerCx2CustomReceiveCreate</a> call; or a system-DMA-transmit object exists from a previous <a href="serports.sercx2systemdmatransmitcreate">SerCx2CustomTransmitCreate</a> call; or <a href="serports.sercx2pioreceivecreate">SerCx2PioReceiveCreate</a> has not yet been called to create a PIO-receive object.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</b></dt>
</dl>A parameter value is not valid.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INFO_LENGTH_MISMATCH</b></dt>
</dl>The <i>Config</i>-&gt;<b>Size</b> value does not equal <b>sizeof</b>(<b>SERCX2_CUSTOM_RECEIVE_CONFIG</b>).
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES</b></dt>
</dl>Insufficient resources are available to create the custom-receive object.

 

## -remarks
This method is called by the serial controller driver to create a custom-receive object. SerCx2 uses this object to do custom-receive transactions, which are transactions that use a custom data-transfer mechanism to read data received by the serial controller.

A serial controller driver must successfully call the <a href="serports.sercx2initializedevice">SerCx2InitializeDevice</a> and <a href="serports.sercx2pioreceivecreate">SerCx2PioReceiveCreate</a> methods before calling <b>SerCx2CustomReceiveCreate</b>.

Before calling <b>SerCx2CustomReceiveCreate</b>, the serial controller driver must call the <a href="serports.sercx2_custom_receive_config_init">SERCX2_CUSTOM_RECEIVE_CONFIG_INIT</a> function to initialize the <a href="serports.sercx2_custom_receive_config">SERCX2_CUSTOM_RECEIVE_CONFIG</a> structure pointed to by <i>CustomReceiveConfig</i>. This function sets the following members of the structure to zero:

If necessary, the serial controller driver can set any of these members to nonzero values after the initialization function returns. However, for convenience, <b>SerCx2CustomReceiveCreate</b> uses the following default values if these members are zero:

If the calling driver sets <b>Exclusive</b> to <b>TRUE</b>, the <b>MinimumTransferUnit</b>, <b>Alignment</b>, and <b>MinimumTransactionLength</b> members must be zero. For more information, see <a href="serports.sercx2_custom_receive_config">SERCX2_CUSTOM_RECEIVE_CONFIG</a>.

As an option, a serial controller driver can use the <i>Attributes</i> parameter to create a context for the custom-receive object, and to supply pointers to <a href="..\wdfobject\nc-wdfobject-evt_wdf_object_context_cleanup.md">EvtCleanupCallback</a> and <a href="..\wdfobject\nc-wdfobject-evt_wdf_object_context_destroy.md">EvtDestroyCallback</a> functions that are called to prepare the object for deletion. For more information, see <a href="kmdf.wdf_object_attributes">WDF_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES</a>.

If the <i>Attributes</i> parameter points to a <a href="kmdf.wdf_object_attributes">WDF_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES</a> structure, the caller must not overwrite the values that the <a href="kmdf.wdf_object_attributes_init">WDF_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES_INIT</a> initialization function writes to the <b>ParentObject</b>, <b>ExecutionLevel</b>, and <b>SynchronizationScope</b> members of this structure.

For more information about creating custom-receive objects, see <a href="serports.sercx2customreceive">SERCX2CUSTOMRECEIVE</a>. For more information about custom-receive transactions, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/29849A8C-6656-444C-BE91-405A4BA2D5B0">SerCx2 Custom-Receive Transactions</a>.
