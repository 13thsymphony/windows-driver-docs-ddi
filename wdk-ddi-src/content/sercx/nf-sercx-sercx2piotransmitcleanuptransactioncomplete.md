# SerCx2PioTransmitCleanupTransactionComplete function
The <b>SerCx2PioTransmitCleanupTransactionComplete</b> method notifies version 2 of the serial framework extension (SerCx2) that serial controller driver has finished cleaning up the serial controller's hardware state after a PIO-transmit transaction.

## Syntax

````
VOID SerCx2PioTransmitCleanupTransactionComplete(
  [in] SERCX2PIOTRANSMIT PioTransmit
);
````

## Parameters

`PioTransmit`

A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/serports/sercx2-object-handles">SERCX2PIOTRANSMIT</a> handle to a PIO-transmit object. The serial controller driver previously called the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx2piotransmitcreate.md">SerCx2PioTransmitCreate</a> method to create this object.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

After a PIO-transmit transaction ends, SerCx2 calls the <a href="..\sercx\nc-sercx-evt_sercx2_pio_transmit_cleanup_transaction.md">EvtSerCx2PioTransmitCleanupTransaction</a> event callback function, if it is implemented, to clean up the serial controller state. In response to this call, the driver should first do any clean-up work that is needed; then the driver must call <b>SerCx2PioTransmitCleanupTransactionComplete</b> to notify SerCx2. SerCx2 waits for this notification to start the next transaction.

The serial must call <b>SerCx2PioTransmitCleanupTransactionComplete</b> only in response to a call to the <i>EvtSerCx2PioTransmitCleanupTransaction</i> function.
