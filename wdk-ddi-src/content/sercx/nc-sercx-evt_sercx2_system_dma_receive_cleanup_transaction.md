# EVT_SERCX2_SYSTEM_DMA_RECEIVE_CLEANUP_TRANSACTION function
The <i>EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCleanupTransaction</i> event callback function is called by version 2 of the serial framework extension (SerCx2) to clean up the serial controller state after a system-DMA-receive transaction ends.

## Syntax

```
EVT_SERCX2_SYSTEM_DMA_RECEIVE_CLEANUP_TRANSACTION EvtSercx2SystemDmaReceiveCleanupTransaction;

void EvtSercx2SystemDmaReceiveCleanupTransaction(
  SERCX2SYSTEMDMARECEIVE SystemDmaReceive
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`SystemDmaReceive`

A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/serports/sercx2-object-handles">SERCX2SYSTEMDMARECEIVE</a> handle to a system-DMA-receive object. The serial controller driver previously called the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx2systemdmareceivecreate.md">SerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCreate</a> method to create this object.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

Your serial controller driver can, as an option, implement this function. If implemented, the driver registers the function in the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx2systemdmareceivecreate.md">SerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCreate</a> call that creates the system-DMA-receive object.

Your serial controller driver should implement an <i>EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCleanupTransaction</i> function if it needs to clean up the serial controller state at the end of a system-DMA-receive transaction. SerCx2 calls this function, if it is implemented, after a system-DMA-receive transaction ends. In response to the <i>EvtSerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCleanupTransaction</i> call, the serial controller driver must call the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx2systemdmareceivecleanuptransactioncomplete.md">SerCx2SystemDmaReceiveCleanupTransactionComplete</a> method to notify SerCx2 after the clean-up work is done.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn265343">SerCx2 System-DMA-Receive Transactions</a>.
