# EVT_SERCX2_PIO_RECEIVE_INITIALIZE_TRANSACTION function
The <i>EvtSerCx2PioReceiveInitializeTransaction</i> event callback function is called by version 2 of the serial framework extension (SerCx2) to prepare the serial controller to perform a PIO-receive transaction.

## Syntax

```
EVT_SERCX2_PIO_RECEIVE_INITIALIZE_TRANSACTION EvtSercx2PioReceiveInitializeTransaction;

void EvtSercx2PioReceiveInitializeTransaction(
  SERCX2PIORECEIVE PioReceive,
  ULONG Length
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`PioReceive`

A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/serports/sercx2-object-handles">SERCX2PIORECEIVE</a> handle to a PIO-receive object. The serial controller driver previously called the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx2pioreceivecreate.md">SerCx2PioReceiveCreate</a> method to create this object.

`Length`

The number of bytes to be transferred in the PIO-receive transaction.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

Your serial controller driver can, as an option, implement this function. If implemented, the driver registers the function in the call to the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx2pioreceivecreate.md">SerCx2PioReceiveCreate</a> method that creates the PIO-receive object.

Your driver should implement an <i>EvtSerCx2PioReceiveInitializeTransaction</i> function if it needs to initialize the serial controller and associated hardware in preparation for a new PIO-receive transaction. SerCx2 calls this function, if it is implemented, before a PIO-receive transaction starts. In response to this call, the serial controller driver must call the <a href="..\sercx\nf-sercx-sercx2pioreceiveinitializetransactioncomplete.md">SerCx2PioReceiveInitializeTransactionComplete</a> method to notify SerCx2 after the initialization is finished.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn265332">SerCx2 PIO-Receive Transactions</a>.
