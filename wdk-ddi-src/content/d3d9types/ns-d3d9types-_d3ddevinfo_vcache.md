# _D3DDEVINFO_VCACHE structure
DirectX 8.1 and later versions only.
   

The D3DDEVINFO_VCACHE structure describes vertex-cache information of a device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DDEVINFO_VCACHE {
  DWORD Pattern;
  DWORD OptMethod;
  DWORD CacheSize;
  DWORD MagicNumber;
} D3DDEVINFO_VCACHE, *LPD3DDEVINFO_VCACHE;
````

## Members


`CacheSize`

Specifies the effective size, in entries, for which the driver optimizes the vertex cache. The actual cache size is not required to be the size specified in <b>CacheSize</b> because in most cases the actual cache size turns out to be larger. The driver only specifies an optimized size in <b>CacheSize</b> if it also specifies D3DXMESHOPT_VCACHE in the <b>OptMethod</b> member.

`MagicNumber`

Specifies the number that should be used as part of a trial-and-error procedure when determining when to restart the strips list. This number can be set from 1 to the value in the <b>CacheSize</b> member. Typically, the best values are near <b>CacheSize</b>/2.

`OptMethod`

Specifies the method of mesh optimization. The driver can use one of the following values to specify the mesh optimization that it uses: 

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DXMESHOPT_STRIPREORDER (0)

</td>
<td>
Longest strips optimization

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DXMESHOPT_VCACHE (1)

</td>
<td>
Vertex-cache based optimization

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`Pattern`

Specifies the bit pattern. The driver must specify the bit pattern as the CACH four-character code (FOURCC) value. The driver can use the MAKEFOURCC macro as follows to specify the FOURCC value as CACH:

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>MAKEFOURCC('C', 'A', 'C', 'H');</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>

## Remarks
<b>DirectX 8.1 versions only.</b> The Direct3D runtime calls a driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6e1b0bce-1ac5-46e7-ae25-b0d3ce8580a0">D3dGetDriverState</a> function to obtain vertex-cache information from the driver. In this <b>D3dGetDriverState</b> call, the runtime specifies the D3DDEVINFOID_VCACHE flag in the <b>dwFlags</b> member of the DD_GETDRIVERSTATEDATA structure that the runtime passes. The driver specifies vertex-cache information in a D3DDEVINFO_VCACHE structure and returns it at the <b>lpdwStates</b> member of DD_GETDRIVERSTATEDATA.

<b>DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.</b> The Direct3D runtime specifies D3DDP2OP_CREATEQUERY and D3DDP2OP_ISSUEQUERY commands in calls to the driver's <a href="..\d3dhal\nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> callback to create driver-side resources for the query and then to asynchronously query the driver for vertex-cache information. In the call with the D3DDP2OP_CREATEQUERY command, the runtime specifies the D3DQUERYTYPE_VCACHE query type in the <b>QueryType</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dhal\ns-d3dhal-_d3dhal_dp2createquery.md">D3DHAL_DP2CREATEQUERY</a> structure. 

When the driver completes a vertex-cache query, the driver sets the total size of the response buffer in the dwErrorOffset member of the <a href="..\d3dhal\ns-d3dhal-_d3dhal_drawprimitives2data.md">D3DHAL_DRAWPRIMITIVES2DATA</a> structure and sets the <b>ddrval</b> member of D3DHAL_DRAWPRIMITIVES2DATA to D3D_OK for successful completion. The driver also overwrites the incoming command buffer with the outgoing response buffer. This response buffer contains a <a href="..\d3dhal\ns-d3dhal-_d3dhal_dp2responsequery.md">D3DHAL_DP2RESPONSEQUERY</a> structure that identifies a response for the vertex-cache query. This D3DHAL_DP2RESPONSEQUERY is followed by the vertex-cache data in the D3DDEVINFO_VCACHE structure.
