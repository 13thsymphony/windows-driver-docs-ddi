# _D3DRENDERSTATETYPE enumeration



## -description
The D3DRENDERSTATETYPE enumerated type lists a variety of attributes, or render states. 
  The enumerators of D3DRENDERSTATETYPE that are used exclusively by drivers can specify either rendering information or a texture attribute. The following render states are used by display drivers:
  



## -syntax

````
enum  {
  D3DRENDERSTATE_EVICTMANAGEDTEXTURES  = 61, 
  D3DRENDERSTATE_SCENECAPTURE          = 62, 
  D3DRS_DELETERTPATCH                  = 169, 
  D3DRS_MAXVERTEXSHADERINST            = 196, 
  D3DRS_MAXPIXELSHADERINST             = 197 

};
````


## -enum-fields

### -field D3DRENDERSTATE_EVICTMANAGEDTEXTURES

 Determines whether textures are evicted from memory.
The driver uses a BOOL data type without a default value to detect whether to evict.

This render state determines whether the driver evicts textures that it manages (as opposed to textures managed by the Direct3D runtime) from video memory. If the render state value is <b>TRUE</b>, the driver evicts the textures. Otherwise, the driver does not evict those textures.


### -field D3DRENDERSTATE_SCENECAPTURE

Specifies either begin scene information or end scene information for geometric data captured within a frame.
The driver uses a BOOL data type with a default value of <b>TRUE</b> to detect scene-capture information.

The driver responds to D3DRENDERSTATE_SCENECAPTURE first with <b>TRUE</b> for begin scene information and next with <b>FALSE</b> for end scene information to capture geometric data within a frame.
See the <i>permedia2</i> sample driver that ships with the Windows Driver Development Kit (DDK) for an example implementation.
Using the D3DRENDERSTATE_SCENECAPTURE render state in a <a href="..\d3dhal\nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> call replaces the legacy <b>D3DHALCallbacks</b>-&gt;<i>D3dSceneCapture</i> callback routine.

Care must be taken in updating a driver that implements the legacy <b>D3DHALCallbacks</b>-&gt;<i>D3dSceneCapture</i> callback routine to one using the D3DRENDERSTATE_SCENECAPTURE render state. The <i>D3dSceneCapture</i> callback routine uses the constants D3DHAL_SCENE_CAPTURE_START and D3DHAL_SCENE_CAPTURE_END to indicate, respectively, the beginning and end of a scene. The values of these constants are, respectively, 0 and 1. If you use these constants in place of <b>TRUE</b> and <b>FALSE</b> in this render state, the meaning will be the exact opposite of what you intend.


### -field D3DRS_DELETERTPATCH

<b>DirectX 8.0 and later versions only.</b>

Deletes either a rectangular or triangular patch from memory. 
The driver uses a DWORD data type without a default value to detect the patch to delete.

This render state notifies the driver that a patch is to be deleted. The value of this render state is the handle to the patch affected. All cached information should be freed and the handle should be removed from the driver's patch handle table. This render state is not visible to applications but is generated internally when an application calls the <b>DeletePatch</b> function. This render state is sent to the driver only when patches are deleted by <b>DeletePatch</b> explicitly. All other patches should be cleaned up when the device is destroyed.


### -field D3DRS_MAXVERTEXSHADERINST

<b>DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.</b>

Determines the maximum number of instructions that the vertex shader assembler can execute.

The driver uses a DWORD data type with a default value of D3DINFINITEINSTRUCTIONS (0xffffffff) to report the maximum number of vertex-shader instructions.
This maximum number depends on the version of the vertex shader that the display device supports as shown in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Version</th>
<th>Maximum number</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>earlier than 2_0</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2_0 and later</td>
<td>From 2¹⁶ (0x0000ffff) to D3DINFINITEINSTRUCTIONS</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

D3DINFINITEINSTRUCTIONS represents a virtually unlimited amount.

Valid values for this render state are numbers that are powers of 2; if the driver sets any other integer, the runtime uses the next nearest power of 2 number.

The runtime sets the <b>MaxVShaderInstructionsExecuted</b> member of the D3DCAPS9 structure to this maximum number.


### -field D3DRS_MAXPIXELSHADERINST

<b>DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.</b>

Determines the maximum number of instructions that the pixel shader assembler can execute.

The driver uses a DWORD data type with a default value of D3DINFINITEINSTRUCTIONS (0xffffffff) to report the maximum number of pixel-shader instructions.
This maximum number depends on the version of the pixel shader that the display device supports as shown in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Version</th>
<th>Maximum number</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>earlier than 2_0</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2_0</td>
<td>From 96 to D3DINFINITEINSTRUCTIONS</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3_0 and later</td>
<td>From 2¹⁶ (0x0000ffff) to D3DINFINITEINSTRUCTIONS</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

D3DINFINITEINSTRUCTIONS represents a virtually unlimited amount.

Valid values for this render state are numbers that are powers of 2; if the driver sets any other integer, the runtime uses the next nearest power of 2 number.

The runtime sets the <b>MaxVShaderInstructionsExecuted</b> member of the D3DCAPS9 structure to this maximum number.


## -remarks
The driver uses these render states when it performs graphics rendering. Only render states that are specific to drivers are included in the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) documentation. The render states accessible to DirectX applications are included in the DirectX SDK documentation. These application-level render states include such characteristics as whether alpha blending is enabled, whether dithering is enabled, whether Direct3D lighting is used, and the type of shading to be used. 

To update a particular render state, Direct3D stores information about the render state, and then calls the driver's <a href="..\d3dhal\nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> callback routine. The information provided to the driver enables it to:

Determine that it should update one or more render states.

Identify which render states to update, and what the new render state values should be.

Note that for certain render states to be honored, the driver must have previously set capability flags in the relevant member of the D3DPRIMCAPS structure.

In order to indicate a specific render state update, Direct3D inserts a <a href="..\d3dhal\ns-d3dhal-_d3dhal_dp2command.md">D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND</a> structure into the command buffer, setting the <b>bCommand</b> member of this structure to D3DDP2OP_RENDERSTATE (see the description for D3DDP2OP_RENDERSTATE in <a href="..\d3dhal\ne-d3dhal-_d3dhal_dp2operation.md">D3DHAL_DP2OPERATION</a>), and setting the <b>wStateCount</b> member of the same structure to the number of render states to be updated.

Immediately following the <a href="..\d3dhal\ns-d3dhal-_d3dhal_dp2command.md">D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND</a> structure, Direct3D inserts one <a href="..\d3dhal\ns-d3dhal-_d3dhal_dp2renderstate.md">D3DHAL_DP2RENDERSTATE</a> structure into the command buffer for each render state to be updated. The <b>RenderState</b> member of this structure identifies the render state to be changed; the new value of this render state is specified in either the <b>dwState</b> member (for DWORD values) or the <b>fState</b> member (for D3DVALUE values).

The following figure shows a portion of the command buffer containing a D3DDP2OP_RENDERSTATE command and two D3DHAL_DP2RENDERSTATE structures. The first of the three structures indicates that two render states are to be updated. The second structure indicates that the D3DRENDERSTATE_FILLMODE render state is to be changed to D3DFILL_SOLID. The third structure indicates that the D3DRENDERSTATE_SHADEMODE render state should be updated to D3DSHADE_GOURAUD.

<b>
     Additional Notes</b>

See the D3DTEXTURESTAGESTATETYPE, D3DTEXTUREOP, and D3DTEXTUREFILTER enumerated types in the DirectX SDK documentation for complete listings of all of the enabled render state types.

Some changes have been made to the D3DRENDERSTATETYPE enumerated type for DirectX 5.0 and beyond. D3DRENDERSTATE_BLENDENABLE has been removed completely although it is defined as D3DRENDERSTATE_ALPHABLENDENABLE in the <i>d3dtypes.h</i> header file. See D3DRENDERSTATE_COLORKEYENABLE for an explanation. The 128 integer values in the interval [128, 255] are reserved for texture coordinate wrap flags. These are constructed with the D3DWRAP_U and D3DWRAP_V macros. Using a flags word preserves forward compatibility with texture coordinates of higher dimension than 2D.

Multitexture macro ops and D3DRENDERSTATE_TEXTUREFACTOR override all of the per-texture stage blending controls (COLOR{OP,ARG1,ARG2} &amp; ALPHA{OP,ARG1,ARG2}).
