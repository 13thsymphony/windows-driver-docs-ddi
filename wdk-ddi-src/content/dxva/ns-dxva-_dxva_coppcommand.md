# _DXVA_COPPCommand structure
The DXVA_COPPCommand structure describes a command sent to a protected video session that is associated with a COPP DirectX VA device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DXVA_COPPCommand {
  GUID  macKDI;
  GUID  guidCommandID;
  ULONG dwSequence;
  ULONG cbSizeData;
  UCHAR CommandData[4056];
} DXVA_COPPCommand, *LPDXVA_COPPCommand;
````

## Members


`cbSizeData`

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the command data at <b>CommandData</b>.

`CommandData`

Specifies an array that comprises the command data.

`dwSequence`

Specifies a sequence number. For the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff539642">COPPCommand</a> function to process the command, the value in <b>dwSequence</b> must match the 32-bit random starting status sequence number that was passed in the <a href="..\dxva\ns-dxva-_dxva_coppsignature.md">DXVA_COPPSignature</a> structure to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540421">COPPSequenceStart</a> function.

`guidCommandID`

Specifies the GUID that identifies the command. The following GUIDs are supported:




#### DXVA_COPPSetProtectionLevel

Sets the protection type and level on the physical connector associated with the COPP device.

The DXVA_COPPSetProtectionLevel GUID is defined as follows:
<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>DEFINE_GUID(DXVA_COPPSetProtectionLevel,
    0x9bb9327c,0x4eb5,0x4727,0x9f,0x00,0xb4,0x2b,0x09,0x19,0xc0,0xda);</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>

#### DXVA_COPPSetSignaling

An instruction about how to protect the signal that goes through the physical connector associated with the DirectX VA COPP device.

The DXVA_COPPSetSignaling GUID is defined as follows:
<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>DEFINE_GUID(DXVA_COPPSetSignaling,
    0x9a631a5,0xd684,0x4c60,0x8e,0x4d,0xd3,0xbb,0xf,0xb,0xe3,0xee);</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>

`macKDI`

Specifies a message authentication code (MAC) GUID for the command at <b>CommandData</b>. The display driver can use the MAC to verify that the transmission of the command was secure (that is, it was not tampered with in transit to the driver).

## Remarks
For a DXVA_COPPSetProtectionLevel command, the protection information is supplied in the first 16 bytes of the <b>CommandData</b> array (the protection type in the first 4 bytes, the protection level in the next 4 bytes, and possibly some extended information in the last 8 bytes). In the call to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff539642">COPPCommand</a> function, the <b>CommandData</b> array should be cast to a pointer to a <a href="..\dxva\ns-dxva-_dxva_coppsetprotectionlevelcmddata.md">DXVA_COPPSetProtectionLevelCmdData</a> structure, which contains protection type, protection level, and extended information members. 

For a DXVA_COPPSetSignaling command, the signaling information is supplied by casting the <b>CommandData</b> array to a pointer to a <a href="..\dxva\ns-dxva-_dxva_coppsetsignalingcmddata.md">DXVA_COPPSetSignalingCmdData</a> structure.

## Requirements
