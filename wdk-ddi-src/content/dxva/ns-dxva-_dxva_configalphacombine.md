# _DXVA_ConfigAlphaCombine structure
The DXVA_ConfigAlphaCombine structure is sent by the host decoder to the accelerator to set the configuration for alpha-blending combination operations.

## Members


`bConfigBlendType`

Specifies the type of alpha-blend combinations to be performed. Zero indicates front-end buffer-to-buffer blend, and 1 indicates back-end hardware blend.

The preferred value for an accelerator to support is zero.

`bConfigGraphicResizing`

Indicates whether alpha blending is supported in graphic image resizing. A value of 1 indicates that it is; a value of zero indicates that it is not. <b>bConfigGraphicResizing</b> specifies whether the <b>GraphicSourceRect</b> member of <a href="..\dxva\ns-dxva-_dxva_blendcombination.md">DXVA_BlendCombination</a> (for subpicture blending) may differ in size from the <b>GraphicDestinationRect</b> member of DXVA_BlendCombination. If these values are different, the alpha-blending graphic must be resampled by the accelerator.

`bConfigOnlyUsePicDestRectArea`

Specifies whether the decoder can perform operations that use values for areas of a destination picture outside the area defined by the <b>PictureDestinationRect</b> member of the DXVA_BlendCombination structure. The value zero indicates that areas outside of <b>PictureDestinationRect</b> can be specified and displayed by the blend combination commands. The value 1 indicates that the decoder cannot rely on the values of, or display, any region of the blended surface outside of the area specified by <b>PictureDestinationRect</b>.

`bConfigPictureResizing`

Specifies whether the <b>PictureSourceRect16thPel</b> member of <a href="..\dxva\ns-dxva-_dxva_blendcombination.md">DXVA_BlendCombination</a> for graphic blending may differ in width and height from the <b>PictureDestinationRect</b> member of DXVA_BlendCombination (adjusted for the one-sixteenth sample scaling of <b>PictureSourceRect16thPel</b>). This member also specifies whether the values in <b>PictureSourceRect16thPel</b> are multiples of 16, thus requiring the source picture to be resampled by the accelerator. A value of 1 indicates that resampling (whether for resizing or for subpixel accuracy) is supported; a value of zero indicates that it is not.

`bConfigWholePlaneAlpha`

Specifies whether a whole-plane alpha opacity value can be applied to the graphic image. A value of 1 indicates that a whole-plane alpha can be applied; a value of zero indicates that it cannot.

`dwFunction`

Indicates the type of query or response when using probing and locking commands. The most significant 24 bits of <b>dwFunction</b> is the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/bfb1a98e-b9f0-4baa-b486-b2ff33a8bac5">DXVA_ConfigQueryOrReplyFlag</a> variable.

The least significant 4 bits of the <i>DXVA_ConfigQueryOrReplyFlag</i> variable contain status indicators for the query or response being performed.

The least significant 8 bits of <b>dwFunction</b> is the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6db9fa71-7bc2-4eb6-afcb-b16df48f7e8b">bDXVA_Func variable</a> that, in this case, is equal to 3.

`dwReservedBits`

Specifies the reserved bits used for packing and alignment. This member must be zero.
