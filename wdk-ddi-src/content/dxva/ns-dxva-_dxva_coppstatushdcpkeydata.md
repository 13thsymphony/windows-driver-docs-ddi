# _DXVA_COPPStatusHDCPKeyData structure
The DXVA_COPPStatusHDCPKeyData structure describes a High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) receiver or repeater key selection vector (KSV).

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DXVA_COPPStatusHDCPKeyData {
  GUID  rApp;
  ULONG dwFlags;
  ULONG dwHDCPFlags;
  GUID  BKey;
  GUID  Reserved1;
  GUID  Reserved2;
} DXVA_COPPStatusHDCPKeyData;
````

## Members


`BKey`

Specifies  the HDCP receiver or repeater KSV (Bksv), as defined by HDCP Specification Revision 1.1, in the least significant 40 bits.

`dwFlags`

Specifies additional status information that might be relevant to the calling application. The display driver should set <b>dwFlags</b> to the COPP_StatusNormal (0x00) value from the <b>COPP_StatusFlags</b> enumeration type or to a valid ORed combination of the following COPP_StatusFlags:

<ul>
<li>
COPP_LinkLost (0x01)

</li>
<li>
COPP_RenegotiationRequired (0x02)

</li>
</ul>

`dwHDCPFlags`

Specifies the current HDCP characteristics of the device connected to a Digital Video Interface (DVI) or High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) output connector. The display driver can set <b>dwHDCPFlags</b> to COPP_HDCPRepeater (0x01) from the <b>COPP_StatusHDCPFlags</b> enumeration type to indicate that the device is a repeater.

`rApp`

Specifies a 128-bit random number, used once. This random number is generated by the requesting application and supplied to the display driver in the <b>rApp</b> member of the <a href="..\dxva\ns-dxva-_dxva_coppstatusinput.md">DXVA_COPPStatusInput</a> structure.

`Reserved1`

Reserved. Should be set to zero (GUID_NULL).

`Reserved2`

Reserved. Should be set to zero (GUID_NULL).

## Remarks
The display driver returns status about the HDCP key through the <i>pOutput</i> parameter of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff539652">COPPQueryStatus</a>. The <a href="..\dxva\ns-dxva-_dxva_coppstatusoutput.md">DXVA_COPPStatusOutput</a> structure describes the returned status information. The display driver should cast the HDCP key status to a pointer to a DXVA_COPPStatusHDCPKeyData structure and return the status information in the <b>COPPStatus</b> member of DXVA_COPPStatusOutput. 

Applications initiate a query for HDCP key data to determine if the receiver or repeater device is revoked; they can then disable protected content flow to the device. Applications must obtain lists of revoked KSVs by processing System Renewability Messages (SRMs). In coordination with <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=38728">Digital Content Protection LLC</a>, owners of HDCP licensing applications should not let protected content flow to HDCP repeaters for COPP version 1.0.
