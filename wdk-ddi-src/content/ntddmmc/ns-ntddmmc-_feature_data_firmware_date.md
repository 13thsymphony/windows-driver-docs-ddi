# _FEATURE_DATA_FIRMWARE_DATE structure
The FEATURE_DATA_FIRMWARE_DATE structure holds the date information associated with the Firmware Information feature.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _FEATURE_DATA_FIRMWARE_DATE {
  FEATURE_HEADER Header;
  UCHAR          Year[4];
  UCHAR          Month[2];
  UCHAR          Day[2];
  UCHAR          Hour[2];
  UCHAR          Minute[2];
  UCHAR          Seconds[2];
  UCHAR          Reserved[2];
} FEATURE_DATA_FIRMWARE_DATE, *PFEATURE_DATA_FIRMWARE_DATE;
````

## Members


`Day`

Contains two decimal digits represented as ASCII characters that indicate the day. For example, if the day is August 12, the <b>Day</b> member will contain characters "12" (a hexadecimal value of 0x3132).

`Header`

Contains a <a href="..\ntddmmc\ns-ntddmmc-_feature_header.md">FEATURE_HEADER</a> structure with header information for this feature descriptor.

`Hour`

Contains two decimal digits represented as ASCII characters that indicate the hour. For example, if the time 1:20:43 PM, the <b>Hour</b> member will contain the characters "13" (hexadecimal value of 0x3133).

`Minute`

Contains two decimal digits represented as ASCII characters that indicates the minute of the hour. For example, if the time 1:20:43 PM, the <b>Minute</b> member will contain the characters "20" (hexadecimal value of 0x3230).

## Remarks
The structure holds the date information associated with the feature named "Firmware Information" by the <i>SCSI Multimedia - 4</i> (<i>MMC-4</i>) specification. Devices that support this feature can be queried for the date and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) of the creation of the firmware revision currently loaded on the device.
