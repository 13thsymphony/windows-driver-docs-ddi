## -struct-fields

### -field Header

Contains a <a href="storage.feature_header">FEATURE_HEADER</a> structure with header information for this feature descriptor.


### -field RWSubchannelsRecordable

Indicates, when set to 1, that the device can record the read/write subchannels with user-supplied data. 


### -field CdRewritable

Indicates, when set to 1, that the device supports overwriting a Track-at-Once track with another track's information. 


### -field TestWriteOk

Indicates, when set to 1, that the device can perform test writes. 


### -field RWSubchannelPackedOk

Indicates, when set to 1, that the device supports writing R-W sub code in the packed mode. 


### -field RWSubchannelRawOk

Indicates, when set to 1, that the device supports writing R-W sub code in the raw mode. 


### -field Reserved1

Reserved. 


### -field BufferUnderrunFree

Indicates, when set to 1, that the device is capable of zero-loss linking.


### -field Reserved3

Reserved. 


### -field Reserved2

Reserved. 


### -field DataTypeSupported

Indicates the data types that the device supports. See the <i>SCSI Multimedia 3</i> (<i>MMC-3</i>) specification for a description of the values that this member can take. <b>DataTypeSupported</b>[0] holds the most significant byte of value that indicates the data types. <b>DataTypeSupported</b>[1] holds the least significant byte of that value. 


## -remarks
This structure holds data for the feature named "CD Track at Once" by the <i>MMC-3 </i>specification. Devices that support this feature can write data to a CD track.
