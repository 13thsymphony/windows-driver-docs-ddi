# _FEATURE_DATA_CD_READ structure
The FEATURE_DATA_CD_READ structure contains information about the CD Read feature.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _FEATURE_DATA_CD_READ {
  FEATURE_HEADER Header;
  UCHAR          CDText  :1;
  UCHAR          C2ErrorData  :1;
  UCHAR          Reserved01  :5;
  UCHAR          DigitalAudioPlay  :1;
  UCHAR          Reserved2[3];
} FEATURE_DATA_CD_READ, *PFEATURE_DATA_CD_READ;
````

## Members


`C2ErrorData`

Indicates, when set to 1, that the device supports the C2 error pointers as described in the <i>MMC-3 </i>specification. When set to zero, it indicates that the device does not support C2 error pointers.

`CDText`

Indicates, when set to 1, that the device supports format code 0x05 of the READ/TOC/PMA/ATIP command, as defined in the <i>SCSI Multimedia - 4 (MMC-4)</i> specification. When set to zero, CD-Text is not supported.

`DigitalAudioPlay`



`Header`

Contains a <a href="..\ntddmmc\ns-ntddmmc-_feature_header.md">FEATURE_HEADER</a> structure with header information for this feature descriptor.

`Reserved01`



`Reserved2`

Reserved.

## Remarks
This structure holds data for the feature named "CD Read" by the <i>MMC-3 </i>specification. Devices that support this feature can read CD-specific information from the media and can read user data from all types of CD blocks.
