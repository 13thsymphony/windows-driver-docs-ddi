# _FEATURE_DATA_CORE structure
The FEATURE_DATA_CORE structure holds data for the Core feature descriptor.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _FEATURE_DATA_CORE {
  FEATURE_HEADER Header;
  UCHAR          PhysicalInterface[4];
  UCHAR          DeviceBusyEvent  :1;
  UCHAR          INQUIRY2  :1;
  UCHAR          Reserved1  :6;
  UCHAR          Reserved2[3];
} FEATURE_DATA_CORE, *PFEATURE_DATA_CORE;
````

## Members


`DeviceBusyEvent`



`Header`

Contains a <a href="..\ntddmmc\ns-ntddmmc-_feature_header.md">FEATURE_HEADER</a> structure with header information for this feature descriptor.

`INQUIRY2`



`PhysicalInterface`

Must be set to the current communication path between initiator and device, as defined in the <i>SCSI Multimedia - 4 (MMC-4)</i> specification. The bytes of this array are arranged in big-endian order. <b>PhysicalInterface</b>[0] contains the most significant byte, and <b>PhysicalInterface</b>[3] contains the least significant byte.
