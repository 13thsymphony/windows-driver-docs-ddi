## -struct-fields

### -field Header

Contains a <a href="storage.feature_header">FEATURE_HEADER</a> structure with header information for this feature descriptor. 


### -field Blank

Indicates, when set to 1, that the device supports the BLANK command defined by the <i>SCSI Multimedia - 4 (MMC-4)</i> specification, with Blanking Types of zero and one. When set to zero, this bit indicates that the device does not support this command. 


### -field Intermediate

Indicates, when set to 1, that the device supports writing on an intermediate state-bordered area and quick formatting (Format Type of 15 - Quick Format, as defined by the <i>MMC-3</i> specification). When set to zero, this bit indicates that the device does not support writing on an intermediate state-bordered area nor does it support quick formatting. 


### -field DefectStatusDataRead

Corresponds to the Defect Status Bitmap Read (DSBR) bit as defined by the <i>MMC-3</i> specification. When set to 1, this bit indicates that the device allows initiators to read the Defect Status Bitmap of a medium. When set to zero, this bit indicates that the device does not support the reading of Defect Status Bitmap. 


### -field DefectStatusDataGenerate

Corresponds to the Defect Status Bitmap Generate (DSBG) bit as defined by the <i>MMC-3</i> specification. When set to 1, this bit indicates that the device can generate a Defect Status Bitmap during formatting. When set to zero, this bit indicates that the device cannot generate a Defect Status Bitmap during formatting. 


### -field Reserved0

Reserved. 


### -field Reserved1

Reserved. 


## -remarks
This structure holds data for the feature named "DVD-RW Restricted Overwrite" by the <i>MMC-3 </i>specification. In the <a href="storage.feature_number">FEATURE_NUMBER</a> enumeration, this feature is named <b>FeatureRigidRestrictedOverwrite</b>.
