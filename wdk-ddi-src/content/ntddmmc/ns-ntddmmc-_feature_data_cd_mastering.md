# _FEATURE_DATA_CD_MASTERING structure
The FEATURE_DATA_CD_MASTERING structure holds information for the CD Mastering feature.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _FEATURE_DATA_CD_MASTERING {
  FEATURE_HEADER Header;
  UCHAR          RWSubchannelsRecordable  :1;
  UCHAR          CdRewritable  :1;
  UCHAR          TestWriteOk  :1;
  UCHAR          RawRecordingOk  :1;
  UCHAR          RawMultiSessionOk  :1;
  UCHAR          SessionAtOnceOk  :1;
  UCHAR          BufferUnderrunFree  :1;
  UCHAR          Reserved1  :1;
  UCHAR          MaximumCueSheetLength[3];
} FEATURE_DATA_CD_MASTERING, *PFEATURE_DATA_CD_MASTERING;
````

## Members


`BufferUnderrunFree`

Indicates, when set to 1, that the device is capable of zero-loss linking.

`CdRewritable`

Indicates, when set to 1, that the device can do mastering and TAO recording on rewritable media.

`Header`

`MaximumCueSheetLength`

Indicates the maximum length of a Cue Sheet that can be accepted by the device for Session at Once recording. <b>MaximumCueSheetLength</b>[0] holds the most significant byte of the 3-byte value for the length. <b>MaximumCueSheetLength</b>[2] holds the least significant byte.

`RawMultiSessionOk`

Indicates, when set to 1, that the device can record multisession in raw mode.

`RawRecordingOk`

Indicates, when set to 1, that the device can record using the raw write type.

`Reserved1`

Reserved.

`RWSubchannelsRecordable`

Indicates, when set to 1, that the device can record the R-W subchannels with user-supplied information.

`SessionAtOnceOk`

Indicates, when set to 1, that the device can record using the Session-at-Once recording mode.

`TestWriteOk`

Indicates, when set to 1, that the device can perform test writes.
