  UCHAR          Group3  :1;
  UCHAR          Reserved1  :7;
  UCHAR          Reserved2;
  UCHAR          UnitLength[2];
} FEATURE_DATA_TIMEOUT, *PFEATURE_DATA_TIMEOUT;

## Remarks
This structure holds data for the feature named "Time-Out" by the <i>SCSI Multimedia - 4 (MMC-4) </i>specification. Devices that have this feature must respond to commands within a set time period. When these devices cannot complete commands in the allotted time, they complete the commands with an error.

When queried, devices supporting this feature must return the information indicated in <a href="..\ntddmmc\ns-ntddmmc-_feature_header.md">FEATURE_HEADER</a>. No other feature-specific information is required.
