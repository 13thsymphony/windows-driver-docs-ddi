# _FEATURE_DATA_REMOVABLE_MEDIUM structure
The FEATURE_DATA_REMOVABLE_MEDIUM structure contains data for the removable medium feature.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _FEATURE_DATA_REMOVABLE_MEDIUM {
  FEATURE_HEADER Header;
  UCHAR          Lockable  :1;
  UCHAR          Reserved1  :1;
  UCHAR          DefaultToPrevent  :1;
  UCHAR          Eject  :1;
  UCHAR          Reserved2  :1;
  UCHAR          LoadingMechanism  :3;
  UCHAR          Reserved3[3];
} FEATURE_DATA_REMOVABLE_MEDIUM, *PFEATURE_DATA_REMOVABLE_MEDIUM;
````

## Members


`DBML`



`DefaultToPrevent`

Indicates, when set to zero, that the prevent jumper is present. This overrides the lock command, so that locking the device shall not prevent the insertion of media.

`Eject`

Indicates, when set to 1, that the device can eject the medium or magazine. When set to zero, this bit indicates that the device cannot eject the medium or magazine by means of the normal start/stop command sequence.

`Header`

Contains a <a href="..\ntddmmc\ns-ntddmmc-_feature_header.md">FEATURE_HEADER</a> structure with header information for this feature descriptor.

`Load`



`LoadingMechanism`

Indicates the type of loading mechanism. See the <i>SCSI Multimedia - 4 (MMC-4)</i> specification for the list of values that this member can take.

`Lockable`

Indicates, when set to 1, that the initiator can lock the medium into the device. When set to zero, this bit indicates that the medium cannot be locked into the device.

`Reserved3`

Reserved.

## Remarks
This structure holds data for the feature named "Removable Medium" by the <i>MMC-3 </i>specification. Devices that support this feature allow the medium to be removed from the device. They also can communicate to the initiator that the user wants to eject the medium or has inserted a new medium.
