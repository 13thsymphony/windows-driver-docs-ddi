# WdfDeviceSetAlignmentRequirement function
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF only]

The <b>WdfDeviceSetAlignmentRequirement</b> method registers the driver's preferred address alignment for the data buffers that the device uses during memory transfer operations.

## Syntax

````
VOID WdfDeviceSetAlignmentRequirement(
  _In_ WDFDEVICE Device,
  _In_ ULONG     AlignmentRequirement
);
````

## Parameters

`Device`

A handle to a framework device object.

`AlignmentRequirement`

The alignment requirement for a data buffer. This value must be one less than the alignment boundary. For example, you can specify 15 for a 16-byte alignment boundary and 31 for a 32-byte alignment boundary. You can also use one of the FILE_<i>Xxxx</i>_ALIGNMENT constants that are defined in <i>Wdm.h</i>.


## Return Value

None.

A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.

## Remarks

A driver that uses direct I/O can call  <b>WdfDeviceSetAlignmentRequirement</b> to register a preferred alignment requirement.  The alignment applies to I/O requests that go through the I/O Manager, and  not those sent to your driver from another driver that calls <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iocalldriver.md">IoCallDriver</a>.

 Because the I/O manager does not always use the requested alignment, the driver should be prepared for unaligned buffers.

The driver can call <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicegetalignmentrequirement.md">WdfDeviceGetAlignmentRequirement</a> to obtain the current value for the device's alignment requirement.

The I/O manager sets an alignment requirement value for the device when the driver calls <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicecreate.md">WdfDeviceCreate</a>. For more information about a device's alignment requirement value and when a driver must change the value, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547807">Initializing a Device Object</a> in the WDM documentation.

If your driver specifies an alignment requirement that is greater that the computer's page size (PAGE_SIZE), the logical addresses that the <a href="..\wdfcommonbuffer\nf-wdfcommonbuffer-wdfcommonbuffergetalignedlogicaladdress.md">WdfCommonBufferGetAlignedLogicalAddress</a> method returns are always aligned to the specified alignment requirement, but the virtual addresses that the <a href="..\wdfcommonbuffer\nf-wdfcommonbuffer-wdfcommonbuffergetalignedvirtualaddress.md">WdfCommonBufferGetAlignedVirtualAddress</a> method returns might not be aligned to the alignment requirement.

If your driver specifies an alignment requirement that is less than the computer's page size, all logical and virtual addresses are aligned to the specified alignment requirement.

For more information about calling <b>WdfDeviceSetAlignmentRequirement</b>, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/enabling-dma-transactions">Enabling DMA Transactions</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/81a56f62-917e-4798-b2cc-6469c802fab8">Using Common Buffers</a>.
