## Members


`D1Latency`

The approximate time, in 100-nanosecond units, that the device requires to return to its D0 state from its D1 state. If this value is -1, the framework uses whatever value is currently stored in the system for this member.

`D2Latency`

The approximate time, in 100-nanosecond units, that the device requires to return to its D0 state from its D2 state. If this value is -1, the framework uses whatever value is currently stored in the system for this member.

`D3Latency`

The approximate time, in 100-nanosecond units, that the device requires to return to its D0 state from its D3 state. If this value is -1, the framework uses whatever value is currently stored in the system for this member.

`DeviceD1`

A <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ne-wudfddi_types-_wdf_tri_state.md">WDF_TRI_STATE</a>-typed value that indicates, if set to <b>WdfTrue</b>, that the device supports device sleeping state D1. For more information about the <b>WDF_TRI_STATE</b> value, see the following Remarks section.

`DeviceD2`

A <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ne-wudfddi_types-_wdf_tri_state.md">WDF_TRI_STATE</a>-typed value that indicates, if set to <b>WdfTrue</b>, that the device supports device sleeping state D2.

`DeviceState`

An array of DEVICE_POWER_STATE-typed values that indicates the most-powered device state that the device supports for each system power state. This array uses the SYSTEM_POWER_STATE enumeration as index values. If an array element's value is <b>PowerDeviceMaximum</b>, the framework uses whatever value that the operating system has stored for that element. The DEVICE_POWER_STATE and SYSTEM_POWER_STATE enumerations are defined in <i>wdm.h</i>. For more information about the <b>DeviceState</b> member, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543087">DeviceState</a>.

`DeviceWake`

A DEVICE_POWER_STATE-typed value that indicates the lowest device power state from which the device can send a wake signal to the system. If this value is <b>PowerDeviceMaximum</b>, the framework uses whatever value is currently stored in the system for this member.

`IdealDxStateForSx`

A DEVICE_POWER_STATE-typed value that indicates the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f594a63f-10ce-439d-abe3-d342555d98f0">device sleeping state</a> that the device should enter when the system enters any <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2fd883b5-4e89-4ce9-b75a-b821348ac860">system sleeping state</a> and the device is not enabled to wake the system. If this value is zero, the framework uses <b>PowerDeviceD3</b>. This value cannot be <b>PowerDeviceD0</b>.

If a driver specifies an <b>IdealDxStateForSx</b> value that represents a higher-powered device sleeping state than the device's stack has specified in the device's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543087">DeviceState</a> array, the framework uses the lower-powered state that is in the array. For example, if the driver specifies an <b>IdealDxStateForSx</b> value of D1 and the device's <b>DeviceState</b> array specifies D2, the framework uses D2.

`Size`

The size, in bytes, of this structure.

`SystemWake`

A SYSTEM_POWER_STATE-typed value that indicates the lowest system power state from which the device can send a wake signal to the system. If this value is <b>PowerSystemMaximum</b>, the framework uses whatever value is currently stored in the system for this member. SYSTEM_POWER_STATE values are defined in <i>wdm.h</i>.

`WakeFromD0`

A <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ne-wudfddi_types-_wdf_tri_state.md">WDF_TRI_STATE</a>-typed value that indicates, if set to <b>WdfTrue</b>, that the device can respond to a wake signal while in its D0 state.

`WakeFromD1`

A <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ne-wudfddi_types-_wdf_tri_state.md">WDF_TRI_STATE</a>-typed value that indicates, if set to <b>WdfTrue</b>, that the device can respond to a wake signal while in its D1 state.

`WakeFromD2`

A <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ne-wudfddi_types-_wdf_tri_state.md">WDF_TRI_STATE</a>-typed value that indicates, if set to <b>WdfTrue</b>, that the device can respond to a wake signal while in its D2 state.

`WakeFromD3`

A <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ne-wudfddi_types-_wdf_tri_state.md">WDF_TRI_STATE</a>-typed value that indicates, if set to <b>WdfTrue</b>, that the device can respond to a wake signal while in its D3 state.

## Remarks
The WDF_DEVICE_POWER_CAPABILITIES structure is used as input to <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicesetpowercapabilities.md">WdfDeviceSetPowerCapabilities</a>.

Several members use the <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ne-wudfddi_types-_wdf_tri_state.md">WDF_TRI_STATE</a> type. For these members, the following rules apply:

<ul>
<li>
A value of <b>WdfTrue</b> indicates that the device supports the capability and a value of <b>WdfFalse</b> indicates it does not. 

</li>
<li>
Function drivers and filter drivers can specify <b>WdfTrue</b> or <b>WdfFalse</b>, or a value of <b>WdfUseDefault</b> to indicate that the framework should use the value that was provided by a lower driver in the stack. For example, if a bus driver specifies <b>WdfTrue</b> for <b>DeviceD1</b> and the device's function driver specifies <b>WdfUseDefault</b>, the framework uses <b>WdfTrue</b> for the capability.

</li>
<li>
When a bus driver calls <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicesetpowercapabilities.md">WdfDeviceSetPowerCapabilities</a> after it <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/creating-device-objects-in-a-bus-driver">creates a device object</a> for a child device, it should specify <b>WdfTrue</b> or <b>WdfFalse</b>. A bus driver can specify <b>WdfUseDefault</b> for a child device, but in this case <b>WdfUseDefault</b> is the same as <b>WdfFalse</b>.

</li>
</ul>
To initialize a WDF_DEVICE_POWER_CAPABILITIES structure, a driver should call <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdf_device_power_capabilities_init.md">WDF_DEVICE_POWER_CAPABILITIES_INIT</a>.
