# PFN_WDFDEVICEGETHARDWAREREGISTERMAPPEDADDRESS function



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to UMDF only]

A driver calls <b>WdfDeviceGetHardwareRegisterMappedAddress</b> to get the user-mode mapped address of the memory resource it mapped previously using <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicemapiospace.md">WdfDeviceMapIoSpace</a>.



## -syntax

````
PVOID WdfDeviceGetHardwareRegisterMappedAddress(
  _In_ WDFDEVICE Device,
  _In_ PVOID     PseudoBaseAddress
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Device [in]

A handle to a framework device object.


### -param PseudoBaseAddress [in]

The address of a location that receives a pointer to the pseudo base address.


## -returns
User-mode base address of the resources mapped earlier using <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicemapiospace.md">WdfDeviceMapIoSpace</a>.


## -remarks
This function is the UMDF version 2 equivalent of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/94852404-301F-4C09-81D2-CEDEECFCD6BD">IWDFDevice3::GetHardwareRegisterMappedAddress</a>.

After the driver calls <b>WdfDeviceGetHardwareRegisterMappedAddress</b>, it can access the user-mode address directly to read and write to the register.


<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This is not the recommended approach for accessing registers because it prevents UMDF from doing any validation on the access.</div>
<div> </div>


If you do use <b>WdfDeviceGetHardwareRegisterMappedAddress</b>, you must set the <b>UmdfRegisterAccessMode</b> INF directive to <b>RegisterAccessUsingUserModeMapping</b>.  For more information about UMDF  INF directives, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/aefc678e-dc81-47dc-a84b-f1a79c16cad9">Specifying WDF Directives in INF Files</a>.
