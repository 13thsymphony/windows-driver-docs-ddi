# _WDF_DEVICE_PNP_CAPABILITIES structure



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]

The WDF_DEVICE_PNP_CAPABILITIES structure describes a device's Plug and Play capabilities.

## -struct-fields

### -field Size

The size, in bytes, of this structure.


### -field LockSupported

A <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ne-wudfddi_types-_wdf_tri_state.md">WDF_TRI_STATE</a>-typed value that indicates, if set to <b>WdfTrue</b>, that the device can be locked in its slot to prevent ejection. (This capability disables ejecting a device from its slot, not ejecting media from a device.) For more information about WDF_TRI_STATE-typed values, see the following Remarks section.  


### -field EjectSupported

A WDF_TRI_STATE-typed value that indicates, if set to <b>WdfTrue</b>, that the device can be ejected from its slot. (This capability enables ejecting a device from its slot, not ejecting media from a device.) 


### -field Removable

A WDF_TRI_STATE-typed value that indicates, if set to <b>WdfTrue</b>, that the device can be removed while the system is running. If <b>Removable</b> is set to <b>WdfTrue</b> and <b>SurpriseRemovalOK</b> is set to <b>WdfFalse</b>, users should use the system's Unplug or Eject Hardware program.


### -field DockDevice

A WDF_TRI_STATE-typed value that indicates, if set to <b>WdfTrue</b>, that the device is a docking station.


### -field UniqueID

A WDF_TRI_STATE-typed value that indicates, if set to <b>WdfTrue</b>, that the device's instance ID is unique to the entire system. If <b>UniqueID</b> is set to <b>WdfFalse</b>, the instance ID is unique only to the device's bus. For more information about instance IDs, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/dae23185-63d9-4a0f-9786-c7fa66368826">Device Identification Strings</a>.


### -field SilentInstall

A WDF_TRI_STATE-typed value that indicates, if set to <b>WdfTrue</b>, that Device Manager should not display dialog boxes during installation of the device.


### -field SurpriseRemovalOK

A WDF_TRI_STATE-typed value that indicates, if set to <b>WdfTrue</b> (and if <b>Removable</b> is also set to <b>WdfTrue</b>), that users can remove the device without using the system's Unplug or Eject Hardware program.


### -field HardwareDisabled

A WDF_TRI_STATE-typed value that indicates, if set to <b>WdfTrue</b>, that the device is disabled.


### -field NoDisplayInUI

A WDF_TRI_STATE-typed value that indicates, if set to <b>WdfTrue</b>, that Device Manager should not display the device.


### -field Address

An address that indicates where the device is located on its bus. 

The interpretation of this number is bus-specific. If the address is unknown or the bus driver does not support an address, the bus driver leaves the <b>Address</b> member at its default value of 0xFFFFFFFF (-1).

The following list describes the information that certain bus drivers store in the <b>Address</b> member for their child devices:




### -field 1394

Does not supply an address because the addresses are volatile. Defaults to 0xFFFFFFFF. 


### -field EISA

Slot Number (0-F).


### -field IDE

For an IDE device, the address contains the target ID and LUN. For an IDE channel, the address is 0 if the channel is the primary channel or 1 if the channel is the secondary channel).


### -field ISApnp

Does not supply an address. Defaults to 0xFFFFFFFF.


### -field PC Card (PCMCIA)

The socket number (typically 0x00 or 0x40).


### -field PCI

The device number in the high word and the function number in the low word.


### -field SCSI

The target ID.


### -field USB

The port number.

</dd>
</dl>

### -field UINumber

A number that is associated with the device and can be displayed in user interfaces. This number is typically a user-perceived slot number, such as a number printed next to the slot on the board or some other number that helps the user locate the device. If <b>UINumber</b> is unknown, or if supplying a number would not assist the user in identifying the device's location, the driver sets this value to -1.


## -remarks
Several members use the <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ne-wudfddi_types-_wdf_tri_state.md">WDF_TRI_STATE</a> type. For these members, a value of <b>WdfTrue</b> indicates that the device supports the capability and a value of <b>WdfFalse</b> indicates it does not. A value of <b>WdfUseDefault</b> indicates the framework will use the value that a driver lower in the stack provided. For example, if a bus driver specifies <b>WdfTrue</b> for <b>LockSupported</b> and the device's function driver specifies <b>WdfUseDefault</b>, the framework stores <b>WdfTrue</b> for the capability.

The WDF_DEVICE_PNP_CAPABILITIES structure is used as input to <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicesetpnpcapabilities.md">WdfDeviceSetPnpCapabilities</a>.

To initialize a WDF_DEVICE_PNP_CAPABILITIES structure, a driver should call <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdf_device_pnp_capabilities_init.md">WDF_DEVICE_PNP_CAPABILITIES_INIT</a>.
