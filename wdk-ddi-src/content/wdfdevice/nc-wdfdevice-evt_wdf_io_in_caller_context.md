# EVT_WDF_IO_IN_CALLER_CONTEXT function
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF only]

A driver's <i>EvtIoInCallerContext</i> event callback function preprocesses an I/O request before the framework places it into an I/O queue.

## Syntax

```
EVT_WDF_IO_IN_CALLER_CONTEXT EvtWdfIoInCallerContext;

void EvtWdfIoInCallerContext(
  WDFDEVICE Device,
  WDFREQUEST Request
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Device`

A handle to a framework device object.

`Request`

A handle to a framework request object.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

The framework calls a driver's <i>EvtIoInCallerContext</i> callback function so that the driver can examine each I/O request, and possibly perform preliminary processing on the request, before the framework places it in an I/O queue. To register an <i>EvtIoInCallerContext</i> callback function for a device, the driver calls <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdfdeviceinitsetioincallercontextcallback.md">WdfDeviceInitSetIoInCallerContextCallback</a>. 

If a driver registers an <i>EvtIoInCallerContext</i> callback function for a device, the framework calls the callback function each time it receives an I/O request for the device. The callback function is called in the thread context of the process that sent the I/O request to the driver. This process is either the next-higher level driver or, if the driver is at the top of the driver stack, a user-mode application. 

This callback function's primary purpose is to enable framework-based drivers to support the buffer-access method that is called <a href="wdf.accessing_data_buffers_in_kmdf_drivers#neither#neither">neither buffered nor direct I/O</a>. For this buffer-access method, the driver must access received buffers in the originator's process context.

After the callback function has obtained a request's buffers, it can store buffer addresses or handles in the request object's context storage. (The driver sets the size of the request object's context storage area by calling <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdfdeviceinitsetrequestattributes.md">WdfDeviceInitSetRequestAttributes</a>.)

Because the request does not yet belong to an I/O queue, the framework does not lock or synchronize the request. The driver is responsible for any synchronization that might be necessary. For more information about synchronization, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/synchronization-techniques-for-wdf-drivers">Synchronization Techniques for Framework-Based Drivers</a>.

After the callback function has finished preprocessing the request, it must either queue it by calling <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdfdeviceenqueuerequest.md">WdfDeviceEnqueueRequest</a> or complete it by calling <a href="..\wdfrequest\nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcomplete.md">WdfRequestComplete</a> (if an error is detected).

For more information about the <i>EvtIoInCallerContext</i> callback function, see <a href="wdf.managing_i_o_queues#intercepting_an_i_o_request_before_it_is_queued#intercepting_an_i_o_request_before_it_is_queued">Intercepting an I/O Request before it is Queued</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/accessing-data-buffers-in-wdf-drivers">Accessing Data Buffers in Framework-Based Drivers</a>.

If a driver has configured an I/O queue to support <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/guaranteeing-forward-progress-of-i-o-operations">guaranteed forward progress</a>, the framework might not call the driver's <i>EvtIoInCallerContext</i> callback function during low-memory situations. If all of the framework's reserved request objects are in use, the framework postpones processing the I/O request until a reserved request object is available. In this situation, the framework cannot call the <i>EvtIoInCallerContext</i> callback function for the postponed I/O request because, when a reserved request object becomes available, the framework will no longer be running in the thread context of the process that sent the I/O request to the driver.

The <i>EvtIoInCallerContext</i> callback function is called at the IRQL of the calling thread. If the calling thread is from a user-mode application, the callback function is called at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL. If the calling thread is from a higher-level kernel-mode driver, your driver's <i>EvtIoInCallerContext</i> callback function can be called at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL if both the callback function and the higher-level driver are designed to pass the request at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL.

To define an <i>EvtIoInCallerContext</i> callback function, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of callback function you’re defining. Windows provides a set of callback function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the callback function types helps <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2F3549EF-B50F-455A-BDC7-1F67782B8DCA">Code Analysis for Drivers</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/74feeb16-387c-4796-987a-aff3fb79b556">Static Driver Verifier</a> (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it’s a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

For example, to define an <i>EvtIoInCallerContext</i> callback function that is named <i>MyIoInCallerContext</i>, use the <b>EVT_WDF_IO_IN_CALLER_CONTEXT</b> type as shown in this code example:

Then, implement your callback function as follows:

The <b>EVT_WDF_IO_IN_CALLER_CONTEXT</b> function type is defined in the Wdfdevice.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation to your function definition. The _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the <b>EVT_WDF_IO_IN_CALLER_CONTEXT</b> function type in the header file are used. For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/73a408ba-0219-4fde-8dad-ca330e4e67c3">Declaring Functions by Using Function Role Types for KMDF Drivers</a>. For information about _Use_decl_annotations_, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/c0aa268d-6fa3-4ced-a8c6-f7652b152e61">Annotating Function Behavior</a>.
