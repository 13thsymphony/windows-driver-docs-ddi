# _WDF_FILEOBJECT_CLASS Enumeration
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]

The <b>WDF_FILEOBJECT_CLASS</b> enumeration defines values that identify whether a driver requires a framework file object to represent a file that an application or another driver is attempting to create or open. These values also specify where the framework can store the object's handle.

## Syntax
```
typedef enum _WDF_FILEOBJECT_CLASS {
  WdfFileObjectInvalid                 ,
  WdfFileObjectNotRequired             ,
  WdfFileObjectWdfCanUseFsContext      ,
  WdfFileObjectWdfCanUseFsContext2     ,
  WdfFileObjectWdfCannotUseFsContexts  ,
  WdfFileObjectCanBeOptional
} WDF_FILEOBJECT_CLASS, *PWDF_FILEOBJECT_CLASS;
```

## Constants

<table>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>WdfFileObjectInvalid</td>
                    <td>Reserved for internal use.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>WdfFileObjectNotRequired</td>
                    <td>The driver does not require a framework file object.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>WdfFileObjectWdfCanUseFsContext</td>
                    <td>The driver requires a framework file object. The framework can store the object's handle in the <b>FsContext</b> member of the file's Windows Driver Model (WDM) <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545834">FILE_OBJECT</a> structure.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>WdfFileObjectWdfCanUseFsContext2</td>
                    <td>The driver requires a framework file object. The framework can store the object's handle in the <b>FsContext2</b> member of the file's WDM FILE_OBJECT structure.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>WdfFileObjectWdfCannotUseFsContexts</td>
                    <td>The driver requires a framework file object. The framework cannot store the object's handle in the <b>FsContext</b> or <b>FsContext2</b> member of the file's WDM FILE_OBJECT structure, because one or more drivers are using these members. Therefore, the framework must store the handle internally.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>WdfFileObjectCanBeOptional</td>
                    <td>The driver typically requires a framework file object, but the driver can also handle special situations in which a framework file object is missing or different. For more information about these situations, see the following Remarks section. 

<b>WdfFileObjectCanBeOptional</b> is a bit flag that your driver can OR with the <b>WdfFileObjectWdfCanUseFsContext</b>, <b>WdfFileObjectWdfCanUseFsContext2</b>, or <b>WdfFileObjectWdfCannotUseFsContexts</b> enumerator value. 

Most framework-based drivers do not use this bit flag.

The <b>WdfFileObjectCanBeOptional</b> value is available in version 1.9 and later versions of KMDF.</td>
                </tr>
</table>

## Remarks

The <b>WDF_FILEOBJECT_CLASS</b> enumeration is used in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551319">WDF_FILEOBJECT_CONFIG</a> structure.

If your driver calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549963">WdfRequestGetFileObject</a> to obtain framework file objects for I/O requests, and if you know that some of the WDM I/O request packets (IRPs) that your driver receives do not include WDM file objects, the driver can set the <b>WdfFileObjectCanBeOptional</b> bit flag. 

If your driver sets the <b>WdfFileObjectWdfCanUseFsContext</b>, <b>WdfFileObjectWdfCanUseFsContext2</b>, or <b>WdfFileObjectWdfCannotUseFsContexts</b> value and does <i>not</i> set the <b>WdfFileObjectCanBeOptional</b> bit flag, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/using-kmdf-verifier">the framework's verifier</a> reports an error for the following cases when the driver calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549963">WdfRequestGetFileObject</a> method: 

<ul>
<li>
An IRP does not include a WDM file object.

</li>
<li>
An IRP includes a WDM file object, but the file object is different from the one that the file creation IRP included.

</li>
</ul>
If the <b>WdfFileObjectCanBeOptional</b> bit flag is set, the framework's verifier ignores such cases.
