# EVT_WDF_DEVICE_D0_EXIT callback



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]

A driver's <i>EvtDeviceD0Exit</i> event callback function performs operations that are needed when the driver's device leaves the D0 power state.



## -prototype

````
EVT_WDF_DEVICE_D0_EXIT EvtDeviceD0Exit;

NTSTATUS EvtDeviceD0Exit(
  _In_ WDFDEVICE              Device,
  _In_ WDF_POWER_DEVICE_STATE TargetState
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param Device [in]

A handle to a framework device object.


### -param TargetState [in]

A <a href="wdf.wdf_power_device_state">WDF_POWER_DEVICE_STATE</a>-typed enumerator that identifies the device power state that the device is about to enter.


## -returns
If the <i>EvtDeviceD0Exit</i> callback function encounters no errors, it must return STATUS_SUCCESS or another status value for which <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fe823930-e3ff-4c95-a640-bb6470c95d1d">NT_SUCCESS</a>(<i>status</i>) equals <b>TRUE</b>. Otherwise, it must return a status value for which NT_SUCCESS(<i>status</i>) equals <b>FALSE</b>.


## -remarks
To register an <i>EvtDeviceD0Exit</i> callback function, a driver must call <a href="wdf.wdfdeviceinitsetpnppowereventcallbacks">WdfDeviceInitSetPnpPowerEventCallbacks</a>. 

If the driver has registered an <i>EvtDeviceD0Exit</i> callback function, the framework calls the function each time one of the driver's devices leaves its working (D0) state. A device leaves the D0 state when one of the following occurs:

The system and all of its devices are about to leave their working states and enter a low-power state.

The device is about to enter a low-power state because it is idle, if the device supports low-power idle.

The Plug and Play manager is attempting to redistribute the system's hardware resources.

A user has indicated, typically by means of an application's user interface, that he or she wants to remove the device.

The framework also calls the <i>EvtDeviceD0Exit</i> callback function after a device has been removed unexpectedly (surprise-removed).

For more information about when the framework calls this callback function, see <a href="wdf.pnp_and_power_management_scenarios">PnP and Power Management Scenarios</a>.

Unless the device has been surprise-removed, the framework calls this callback function immediately after it disables the device's interrupts, but before the device's power is reduced from D0. The <i>TargetState</i> parameter identifies the device power state that the device is about to enter. 

The <i>EvtDeviceD0Exit</i> callback function must perform any operations that are necessary before the device enters the specified low-power state, such as saving any information that the driver will need later to restore the device to its D0 power state.

If the <i>TargetState</i> parameter is <b>WdfPowerDevicePrepareForHibernation</b>, the driver must not shut off the device, because the system will use the device when saving its hibernation file. 

If <i>TargetState</i> is <b>WdfPowerDeviceD3Final</b>, you should assume that the system is being turned off, the device is about to be removed, or a <a href="wdf.the_pnp_manager_redistributes_system_resources">resource rebalance</a> is in progress. If your driver must save information, it should write it to disk or some other permanent storage medium. 

For more information about drivers that provide this callback function, see <a href="wdf.supporting_pnp_and_power_management_in_function_drivers">Supporting PnP and Power Management in Function Drivers</a>.

To define an <i>EvtDeviceD0Exit</i> callback function, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of callback function you’re defining. Windows provides a set of callback function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the callback function types helps <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2F3549EF-B50F-455A-BDC7-1F67782B8DCA">Code Analysis for Drivers</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/74feeb16-387c-4796-987a-aff3fb79b556">Static Driver Verifier</a> (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it’s a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

For example, to define an <i>EvtDeviceD0Exit</i> callback function that is named <i>MyDeviceD0Exit</i>, use the <b>EVT_WDF_DEVICE_D0_EXIT</b> type as shown in this code example:

Then, implement your callback function as follows:

The <b>EVT_WDF_DEVICE_D0_EXIT</b> function type is defined in the Wdfdevice.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation to your function definition. The _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the <b>EVT_WDF_DEVICE_D0_EXIT</b> function type in the header file are used. For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/73a408ba-0219-4fde-8dad-ca330e4e67c3">Declaring Functions by Using Function Role Types for KMDF Drivers</a>. For information about _Use_decl_annotations_, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/c0aa268d-6fa3-4ced-a8c6-f7652b152e61">Annotating Function Behavior</a>.
