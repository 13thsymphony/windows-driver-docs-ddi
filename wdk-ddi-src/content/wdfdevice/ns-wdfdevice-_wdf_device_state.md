# _WDF_DEVICE_STATE structure
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]

The <b>WDF_DEVICE_STATE</b> structure specifies a device's Plug and Play state.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _WDF_DEVICE_STATE {
  ULONG         Size;
  WDF_TRI_STATE Disabled;
  WDF_TRI_STATE DontDisplayInUI;
  WDF_TRI_STATE Failed;
  WDF_TRI_STATE NotDisableable;
  WDF_TRI_STATE Removed;
  WDF_TRI_STATE ResourcesChanged;
} WDF_DEVICE_STATE, *PWDF_DEVICE_STATE;
````

## Members


`Disabled`

A <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ne-wudfddi_types-_wdf_tri_state.md">WDF_TRI_STATE</a>-typed value that, if set to <b>WdfTrue</b>, indicates that the device is disabled. For more information about the <b>WDF_TRI_STATE</b> type, see the following Remarks section.

`DontDisplayInUI`

A <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ne-wudfddi_types-_wdf_tri_state.md">WDF_TRI_STATE</a>-typed value that, if set to <b>WdfTrue</b>, indicates that the device is hidden (not displayed) in Device Manager. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5dd02478-9937-4364-bd33-b64ac89c32eb">Viewing Hidden Devices</a>. (After you set this member to <b>WdfTrue</b>, changing its value has no effect.)

`Failed`

A <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ne-wudfddi_types-_wdf_tri_state.md">WDF_TRI_STATE</a>-typed value that, if set to <b>WdfTrue</b>, indicates that the device is present but has failed.

`NotDisableable`

A <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ne-wudfddi_types-_wdf_tri_state.md">WDF_TRI_STATE</a>-typed value that, if set to <b>WdfTrue</b>, indicates that the device cannot be disabled.

`Removed`

A <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ne-wudfddi_types-_wdf_tri_state.md">WDF_TRI_STATE</a>-typed value that, if set to <b>WdfTrue</b>, indicates that the device has been removed.

`ResourcesChanged`

A <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ne-wudfddi_types-_wdf_tri_state.md">WDF_TRI_STATE</a>-typed value that, if set to <b>WdfTrue</b>, indicates that the device's resource requirements have changed.

`Size`

The size, in bytes, of this structure.

## Remarks
Structure members use the <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ne-wudfddi_types-_wdf_tri_state.md">WDF_TRI_STATE</a> type. A value of <b>WdfUseDefault</b> indicates the framework will use the value that was provided by a lower driver in the stack. For example, if a bus driver specifies <b>WdfTrue</b> for <b>NotDisableable</b> and the device's function driver specifies <b>WdfUseDefault</b>, the framework uses <b>WdfTrue</b> for the device state.

The <b>WDF_DEVICE_STATE</b> structure is used as a parameter to <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicesetdevicestate.md">WdfDeviceSetDeviceState</a> and <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicegetdevicestate.md">WdfDeviceGetDeviceState</a>.

To initialize a <b>WDF_DEVICE_STATE</b> structure, the driver must call <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdf_device_state_init.md">WDF_DEVICE_STATE_INIT</a>.

For more information about the members of the <b>WDF_DEVICE_STATE</b> structure, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559618">PNP_DEVICE_STATE</a>.
