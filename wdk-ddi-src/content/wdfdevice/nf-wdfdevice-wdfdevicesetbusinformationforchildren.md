# WdfDeviceSetBusInformationForChildren function
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF only]

The <b>WdfDeviceSetBusInformationForChildren</b> method sets information about a bus that a bus driver supports. This information is available to the bus's child devices.

## Syntax

````
VOID WdfDeviceSetBusInformationForChildren(
  _In_ WDFDEVICE            Device,
  _In_ PPNP_BUS_INFORMATION BusInformation
);
````

## Parameters

`Device`

A handle to a framework device object.

`BusInformation`

A pointer to a caller-allocated <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_pnp_bus_information.md">PNP_BUS_INFORMATION</a> structure that describes the bus.


## Return Value

None.

A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.

## Remarks

Child devices can obtain the information that <b>WdfDeviceSetBusInformationForChildren</b> supplies by calling <a href="..\wdffdo\nf-wdffdo-wdffdoinitqueryproperty.md">WdfFdoInitQueryProperty</a> or <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicequeryproperty.md">WdfDeviceQueryProperty</a>.


#### Examples

The following code example initializes a PNP_BUS_INFORMATION structure and then calls <b>WdfDeviceSetBusInformationForChildren</b>.

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>PNP_BUS_INFORMATION  busInfo;

busInfo.BusTypeGuid = GUID_DEVCLASS_TOASTER;
busInfo.LegacyBusType = PNPBus;
busInfo.BusNumber = 0;

WdfDeviceSetBusInformationForChildren(
                                      device,
                                      &amp;busInfo
                                      );</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
