# WdfWdmDeviceGetWdfDeviceHandle function
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF only]

The <b>WdfWdmDeviceGetWdfDeviceHandle</b> method returns a handle to the framework device object that is associated with a specified WDM device object.

## Syntax

````
WDFDEVICE WdfWdmDeviceGetWdfDeviceHandle(
  _In_ PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject
);
````

## Parameters

`DeviceObject`

A pointer to a WDM <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_device_object.md">DEVICE_OBJECT</a> structure that the calling driver created.


## Return Value

If the specified WDM device object is valid, <b>WdfWdmDeviceGetWdfDeviceHandle</b> returns a handle to the associated framework device object. Otherwise, the method returns <b>NULL</b>.

## Remarks

The WDM DEVICE_OBJECT structure that the driver specifies for the <i>DeviceObject</i> parameter must represent a device object that the calling driver created. For example, the structure cannot represent any of the WDM device objects that the driver specified in a previous call to <a href="..\wdfminiport\nf-wdfminiport-wdfdeviceminiportcreate.md">WdfDeviceMiniportCreate</a>.


#### Examples

The following code example obtains a handle to the framework device object that is associated with a WDM device object that the calling driver created.

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>WDFDEVICE  device;

device = WdfWdmDeviceGetWdfDeviceHandle(pWdmDeviceObject);</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
