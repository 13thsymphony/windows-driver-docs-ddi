# WdfWdmDeviceGetWdfDeviceHandle function



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF only]

The <b>WdfWdmDeviceGetWdfDeviceHandle</b> method returns a handle to the framework device object that is associated with a specified WDM device object.



## -syntax

````
WDFDEVICE WdfWdmDeviceGetWdfDeviceHandle(
  _In_ PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject
);
````


## -parameters

### -param DeviceObject [in]

A pointer to a WDM <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_device_object.md">DEVICE_OBJECT</a> structure that the calling driver created.


## -returns
If the specified WDM device object is valid, <b>WdfWdmDeviceGetWdfDeviceHandle</b> returns a handle to the associated framework device object. Otherwise, the method returns <b>NULL</b>.


## -remarks
The WDM DEVICE_OBJECT structure that the driver specifies for the <i>DeviceObject</i> parameter must represent a device object that the calling driver created. For example, the structure cannot represent any of the WDM device objects that the driver specified in a previous call to <a href="..\wdfminiport\nf-wdfminiport-wdfdeviceminiportcreate.md">WdfDeviceMiniportCreate</a>.

The following code example obtains a handle to the framework device object that is associated with a WDM device object that the calling driver created.
