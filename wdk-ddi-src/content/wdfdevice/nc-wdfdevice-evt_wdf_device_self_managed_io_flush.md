# EVT_WDF_DEVICE_SELF_MANAGED_IO_FLUSH function



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]

A driver's <i>EvtDeviceSelfManagedIoFlush</i> event callback function handles flush activity for the device's self-managed I/O operations.



## -syntax

````
EVT_WDF_DEVICE_SELF_MANAGED_IO_FLUSH EvtDeviceSelfManagedIoFlush;

VOID EvtDeviceSelfManagedIoFlush(
  _In_ WDFDEVICE Device
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param Device [in]

A handle to a framework device object.


## -returns
None


## -remarks
To register an <i>EvtDeviceSelfManagedIoFlush</i> callback function, a driver must call  <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdfdeviceinitsetpnppowereventcallbacks.md">WdfDeviceInitSetPnpPowerEventCallbacks</a>. 

If the driver has registered an <i>EvtDeviceSelfManagedIoFlush</i> callback function, the framework calls it after the device has been removed. The driver should flush (that is, remove) I/O requests that are associated with the device's self-managed I/O operations.

For more information about when the framework calls this callback function, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9175ce95-196d-44bd-b31c-88386fa0d3d3">PnP and Power Management Scenarios</a>.

For more information about drivers that provide this callback function, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/539b3618-44bb-41fd-a9f2-ed6a377c94e2">Using Self-Managed I/O</a>.

You must declare the function by using the EVT_WDF_DEVICE_SELF_MANAGED_IO_FLUSH type. For more information, see the following Example section.

To define an <i>EvtDeviceSelfManagedIoFlush</i> callback function, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of callback function you’re defining. Windows provides a set of callback function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the callback function types helps <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2F3549EF-B50F-455A-BDC7-1F67782B8DCA">Code Analysis for Drivers</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/74feeb16-387c-4796-987a-aff3fb79b556">Static Driver Verifier</a> (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it’s a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

For example, to define an <i>EvtDeviceSelfManagedIoFlush</i> callback function that is named <i>MyDeviceSelfManagedIoFlush</i>, use the <b>EVT_WDF_DEVICE_SELF_MANAGED_IO_FLUSH</b> type as shown in this code example:

Then, implement your callback function as follows:

The <b>EVT_WDF_DEVICE_SELF_MANAGED_IO_FLUSH</b> function type is defined in the Wdfdevice.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation to your function definition. The _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the <b>EVT_WDF_DEVICE_SELF_MANAGED_IO_FLUSH</b> function type in the header file are used. For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/73a408ba-0219-4fde-8dad-ca330e4e67c3">Declaring Functions by Using Function Role Types for KMDF Drivers</a>. For information about _Use_decl_annotations_, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/c0aa268d-6fa3-4ced-a8c6-f7652b152e61">Annotating Function Behavior</a>.
