# StreamClassQueryMasterClock function



## -description
When the minidriver calls the <b>StreamClassQueryMasterClock</b> routine, the class driver queries the appropriate time value of the master clock asynchronously, and passes the result to the routine passed in the <i>ClockCallbackRoutine</i> parameter.



## -syntax

````
VOID StreamClassQueryMasterClock(
  _In_ PHW_STREAM_OBJECT       HwStreamObject,
  _In_ HANDLE                  MasterClockHandle,
  _In_ TIME_FUNCTION           TimeFunction,
  _In_ PHW_QUERY_CLOCK_ROUTINE ClockCallbackRoutine
);
````


## -parameters

### -param HwStreamObject [in]

Pointer to a <a href="stream.hw_stream_object">HW_STREAM_OBJECT</a> indicating the stream that is querying its master clock. The stream may only have one query pending at a time. The class driver passes this value to the callback in the <b>HwStreamObject</b> member of the callback's <i>TimeContext</i> parameter.


### -param MasterClockHandle [in]

Specifies the handle for the master clock that is being queried. The class driver passes this in the SRB_INDICATE_MASTER_CLOCK request to the minidriver's <a href="stream.strminireceivestreamcontrolpacket">StrMiniReceiveStreamControlPacket</a> routine.


### -param TimeFunction [in]

Specifies what time function to query the master clock for. See <a href="stream.hw_time_context">HW_TIME_CONTEXT</a> for the possible values. The class driver passes this value to the callback in the <b>Function</b> member of the <i>TimeContext</i> parameter.


### -param ClockCallbackRoutine [in]

Specifies the routine to which the class driver passes the results. The function prototype must be:

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>    ClockCallbackRoutine(PHW_TIME_CONTEXT TimeContext);</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>

## -returns
None


## -remarks
The class driver queries the master clock and passes the results in the <i>TimeContext</i> parameter (of type <a href="stream.hw_time_context">HW_TIME_CONTEXT</a>) of the callback. In particular, it sets the <b>Time</b> member of this structure to the time value requested in the <i>TimeFunction</i> parameter, the current system time in the <b>SystemTime</b> member of the same structure, and the minidriver's device extension in the <b>HwDeviceExtension</b> member of that structure.

The class driver deallocates the HW_TIME_CONTEXT structure after the clock callback routine terminates, so the callback must store any information the minidriver wishes to maintain. For that purpose, the callback routine may use previously-allocated space in either the minidriver's device extension (<i>TimeContext-</i>&gt;<b>HwDeviceExtension</b>), or the stream extension of the stream that queried its master clock (<i>TimeContext</i>-&gt;<b>HwStreamObject</b>-&gt;<b>HwStreamExtension</b>).

On rare occasions, the graph manager switches the master clock. The class driver exposes a race condition in handling the new master clock. If the minidriver calls a stream class master clock routine immediately after it receives a new clock from the class driver, the class driver may produce unexpected results.
