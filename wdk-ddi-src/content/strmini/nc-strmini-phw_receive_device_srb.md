# PHW_RECEIVE_DEVICE_SRB callback function
The stream class driver calls the minidriver's <i>StrMiniReceiveStreamControlPacket</i> routine to handle I/O requests for a specific stream.

## Syntax

```
PHW_RECEIVE_DEVICE_SRB PhwReceiveDeviceSrb;

void PhwReceiveDeviceSrb(
  IN PHW_STREAM_REQUEST_BLOCK SRB
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`SRB`




## Return Value

None

## Remarks

The stream class driver calls the minidriver's <i>StrMiniReceiveStreamDataPacket</i> routine to handle read and write requests for a specific stream.

The minidriver registers its <i>StrMiniReceiveStreamDataPacket</i> routine as follows: When the class driver opens the stream, it passes a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568191">SRB_OPEN_STREAM</a> request block to the minidriver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568463">StrMiniReceiveDevicePacket</a> routine. The StreamObject of the request packet points to a <a href="..\strmini\ns-strmini-_hw_stream_object.md">HW_STREAM_OBJECT</a>. The minidriver sets the <b>ReceiveDataPacket</b> member of the structure pointed to by <i>pSrb</i>-&gt;<b>StreamObject</b> to the minidriver's <i>StrMiniReceiveDataPacket</i> routine. 

Upon completion of its handling of the request, the minidriver passes the structure back to the class driver by calling <a href="..\strmini\nf-strmini-streamclassstreamnotification.md">StreamClassStreamNotification</a><b>(StreamRequestComplete, pSRB-&gt;StreamObject, pSRB)</b>. 

See information about relevant SRB codes in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568295">Stream Class SRB Reference</a>.

When the minidriver finishes its processing of the request, it enters the return status of the operation in <i>pSrb</i>-&gt;<b>Status</b>. The minidriver should enter STATUS_SUCCESS for normal successful processing. If the minidriver does not support that Command value, it should set <i>pSrb</i>-&gt;<b>Status</b> to STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED. If there is a device hardware error that prevents the minidriver from completing the request, it should set <i>pSrb</i>-&gt;<b>Status</b> to STATUS_IO_DEVICE_ERROR. Other error codes the routine uses in specific circumstances are listed above with the specific Command code.
