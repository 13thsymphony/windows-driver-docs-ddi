# _HW_STREAM_DESCRIPTOR structure
The minidriver uses the HW_STREAM_DESCRIPTOR structure to return stream information to the stream class driver.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _HW_STREAM_DESCRIPTOR {
  HW_STREAM_HEADER      StreamHeader;
  HW_STREAM_INFORMATION StreamInfo;
} HW_STREAM_DESCRIPTOR, *PHW_STREAM_DESCRIPTOR;
````

## Members


`StreamHeader`

Contains the <a href="..\strmini\ns-strmini-_hw_stream_header.md">HW_STREAM_HEADER</a> for the stream descriptor.

`StreamInfo`

Contains the <a href="..\strmini\ns-strmini-_hw_stream_information.md">HW_STREAM_INFORMATION</a> block for the zero stream.

## Remarks
The minidriver returns this structure to the class driver in response to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568173">SRB_GET_STREAM_INFO</a> request. The class driver makes this request by calling the minidriver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568463">StrMiniReceiveDevicePacket</a> routine.

The class driver expects HW_STREAM_DESCRIPTOR to be laid out in memory as an <a href="..\strmini\ns-strmini-_hw_stream_header.md">HW_STREAM_HEADER</a> followed by an array of <a href="..\strmini\ns-strmini-_hw_stream_information.md">HW_STREAM_INFORMATION</a> structures. The array begins at the address of the <b>StreamInfo</b> member. The HW_STREAM_HEADER's <b>NumberOfStreams</b> member indicates the number of entries in the array. The minidriver uses HW_STREAM_HEADER to describe those kernel streaming properties of the driver as a whole, while each HW_STREAM_INFORMATION structure describes each individual stream the device supports.
