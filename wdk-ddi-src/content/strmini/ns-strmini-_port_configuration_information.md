# _PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION structure
PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION describes the hardware settings of a streaming minidriver's device. The class driver fills in most members with information provided by the operating system.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct _PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION {
  ULONG           SizeOfThisPacket;
  PVOID           HwDeviceExtension;
  PDEVICE_OBJECT  ClassDeviceObject;
  PDEVICE_OBJECT  PhysicalDeviceObject;
  ULONG           SystemIoBusNumber;
  INTERFACE_TYPE  AdapterInterfaceType;
  ULONG           BusInterruptLevel;
  ULONG           BusInterruptVector;
  KINTERRUPT_MODE InterruptMode;
  ULONG           DmaChannel;
  ULONG           NumberOfAccessRanges;
  PACCESS_RANGE   AccessRanges;
  ULONG           StreamDescriptorSize;
  PIRP            Irp;
  PKINTERRUPT     InterruptObject;
  PADAPTER_OBJECT DmaAdapterObject;
  PDEVICE_OBJECT  RealPhysicalDeviceObject;
  ULONG           Reserved[1];
} *PPORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION, PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION;
```

## Members


`SizeOfThisPacket`

The size of this structure, in bytes. The class driver fills in this member.

`HwDeviceExtension`

Pointer to the minidriver's device extension. The minidriver may use this buffer to record private information global to the minidriver. The minidriver sets the size of this buffer in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559682">HW_INITIALIZATION_DATA</a> structure it passes when it registers itself via <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568263">StreamClassRegisterMinidriver</a>. The class driver also passes pointers to this buffer in the <b>HwDeviceExtension</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559697">HW_STREAM_OBJECT</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559702">HW_STREAM_REQUEST_BLOCK</a>, and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559706">HW_TIME_CONTEXT</a> structures it passes to the minidriver.

`ClassDeviceObject`

Points to the class-driver-provided functional device object (FDO) for the driver's device.

`PhysicalDeviceObject`

Points to the device object for the driver at the top of the driver stack when the class driver attaches to the driver stack. Drivers use this member when calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548336">IoCallDriver</a> to communicate with the driver stack. The <b>RealPhysicalDeviceObject</b> member points to the actual PDO for the driver's device.

`SystemIoBusNumber`

The class driver fills in this member with the system bus ID number of the device. Bus 0 is the primary system bus.

`AdapterInterfaceType`

Specifies the type of system bus the device is connected to. Possible values include <b>Isa</b>, <b>Eisa</b>, <b>MicroChannel</b>, <b>PCIBus</b>, and <b>PCMCIABus</b>.

`BusInterruptLevel`

The class driver fills in this member with the IRQL for interrupts on this bus.

`BusInterruptVector`

The class driver fills in this member with the interrupt vector used by the device.

`InterruptMode`

The class driver fills in this member with the interrupt mode, either Latched or LevelSensitive.

`DmaChannel`

If the device connects to the ISA bus, the class driver fills in this member with the DMA channel of the device.

`NumberOfAccessRanges`

The number of entries in the <b>AccessRanges</b> array.

`AccessRanges`

The number of entries in the <b>AccessRanges</b> array.

`StreamDescriptorSize`

The minidriver fills in this member with the size of its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559686">HW_STREAM_DESCRIPTOR</a> structure.

`Irp`

Pointer to the PnP device start IRP that triggered this SRB_INITIALIZE_DEVICE request.

`InterruptObject`

If the device uses interrupts, the class driver fills in this member with a pointer to the associated Interrupt object.

`DmaAdapterObject`

If the device uses DMA, the class driver fills in this member with a pointer to the associated DmaAdapter object.

`RealPhysicalDeviceObject`

Pointer to the PDO for the driver's device.

`Reserved`

Reserved for system use. Do not use.

## Remarks
Most of the members of PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION provide information to the minidriver about its use of hardware resources, such as its interrupt vector and the IRQL for its interrupts.
