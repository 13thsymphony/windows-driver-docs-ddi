## Members


`Allocator`

Specifies <b>TRUE</b> if the driver uses allocators. Most minidrivers set this value to <b>FALSE</b>.

`Dma`

If <b>TRUE</b>, the device uses DMA to transfer data for this stream.

`HwClockObject`

Contains the stream's clock object. See <a href="..\strmini\ns-strmini-_hw_clock_object.md">HW_CLOCK_OBJECT</a> for details.

`HwDeviceExtension`

Pointer to the minidriver's device extension. The minidriver may use this buffer to record private information. The minidriver sets the size of this buffer in the <a href="..\storport\ns-storport-_hw_initialization_data.md">HW_INITIALIZATION_DATA</a> structure it passes when it registers itself via <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568263">StreamClassRegisterMinidriver</a>. The class driver also passes pointers to this buffer in the <b>HwDeviceExtension</b> member of the <a href="..\strmini\ns-strmini-_hw_stream_request_block.md">HW_STREAM_REQUEST_BLOCK</a>, <a href="..\strmini\ns-strmini-_hw_time_context.md">HW_TIME_CONTEXT</a>, and <a href="..\strmini\ns-strmini-_port_configuration_information.md">PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION</a> structures it passes to the minidriver.

`HwEventRoutine`

Pointer to the stream's <a href="..\strmini\nc-strmini-phw_event_routine.md">StrMiniEvent</a> routine

`HwStreamExtension`

Points to the stream extension, a buffer allocated by the class driver for the minidriver to use to hold private information about this stream. The minidriver sets the size of the buffer in the <a href="..\storport\ns-storport-_hw_initialization_data.md">HW_INITIALIZATION_DATA</a> structure it passes when it registers itself with the stream class driver.

`Pio`

If <b>TRUE</b>, the device uses programmed I/O to transfer data for this stream. Note that both the <b>Pio</b> and <b>Dma</b> members may be <b>TRUE</b>.

`ReceiveControlPacket`

Pointer to the stream's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568467">StrMiniReceiveStreamControlPacket</a> routine.

`ReceiveDataPacket`

Pointer to the stream's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568470">StrMiniReceiveStreamDataPacket</a> routine.

`Reserved`

Reserved for system use. Do not use.

`SizeOfThisPacket`

Specifies the size, in bytes, of this structure.

`StreamHeaderMediaSpecific`

Specifies the size in bytes of the media-specific, per-stream header extension.

`StreamHeaderWorkspace`

Specifies the size of the per-stream-header workspace.

`StreamNumber`

Specifies the offset of the stream within the minidriver's <a href="..\strmini\ns-strmini-_hw_stream_descriptor.md">HW_STREAM_DESCRIPTOR</a> structure.

## Remarks
This structure is created by the class driver to hold information about a particular stream in the minidriver. For each stream-specific request, the class driver passes the HW_STREAM_OBJECT for the stream in the <b>StreamObject</b> member of the stream request block (See <a href="..\strmini\ns-strmini-_hw_stream_request_block.md">HW_STREAM_REQUEST_BLOCK</a>). 

When the class driver opens the stream and issues the SRB_OPEN_STREAM request to the minidriver's <a href="..\strmini\nc-strmini-phw_receive_device_srb.md">StrMiniReceiveDevicePacket</a> routine, the minidriver initializes the stream object.
