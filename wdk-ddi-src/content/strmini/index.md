## Functions

| Title   | Description   |
| ---- |:---- |
| [StreamClassAbortOutstandingRequests function](nf-strmini-streamclassabortoutstandingrequests.md) | The StreamClassAbortOutstandingRequests routine aborts all outstanding requests, either to a particular stream, or to the entire driver. |
| [StreamClassCallAtNewPriority function](nf-strmini-streamclasscallatnewpriority.md) | The StreamClassCallAtNewPriority routine schedules a routine to be called at a different priority. |
| [StreamClassCompleteRequestAndMarkQueueReady function](nf-strmini-streamclasscompleterequestandmarkqueueready.md) | The StreamClassCompleteRequestAndMarkQueueReady routine completes a request, and signals the class driver that the minidriver is ready to receive a new request of the same type. |
| [StreamClassDebugAssert function](nf-strmini-streamclassdebugassert.md) | A minidriver can use the StreamClassDebugAssert routine in a checked build environment to fail an assert, causing the stream class driver to output a debug message and break into the kernel debugger. |
| [StreamClassDebugPrint function](nf-strmini-streamclassdebugprint.md) | In a checked build environment, the minidriver can use the StreamClassDebugPrint routine to print debug messages to the application window and to the Debugger Command window. |
| [StreamClassDeviceNotification function](nf-strmini-streamclassdevicenotification.md) | Minidrivers use the StreamClassDeviceNotification routine to notify the class driver that it has completed a stream request, or that an event has occurred. |
| [StreamClassGetDmaBuffer function](nf-strmini-streamclassgetdmabuffer.md) | The StreamClassGetDmaBuffer routine returns a pointer to the DMA buffer that the class driver allocates for the minidriver. |
| [StreamClassGetNextEvent function](nf-strmini-streamclassgetnextevent.md) | Minidrivers can use the StreamClassGetNextEvent routine to search the event queue of a device or of a particular stream. |
| [StreamClassGetPhysicalAddress function](nf-strmini-streamclassgetphysicaladdress.md) | The StreamClassGetPhysicalAddress routine translates a virtual memory address to a physical memory address and locks the corresponding physical memory for a DMA operation. |
| [StreamClassQueryMasterClock function](nf-strmini-streamclassquerymasterclock.md) | When the minidriver calls the StreamClassQueryMasterClock routine, the class driver queries the appropriate time value of the master clock asynchronously, and passes the result to the routine passed in the ClockCallbackRoutine parameter. |
| [StreamClassQueryMasterClockSync function](nf-strmini-streamclassquerymasterclocksync.md) | The minidriver may call the StreamClassQueryMasterClockSync routine to synchronously query a stream's master clock. |
| [StreamClassReadWriteConfig function](nf-strmini-streamclassreadwriteconfig.md) | The StreamClassReadWriteConfig routine reads or writes configuration data for the minidriver's parent bus driver. |
| [StreamClassRegisterFilterWithNoKSPins function](nf-strmini-streamclassregisterfilterwithnokspins.md) | The StreamClassRegisterFilterWithNoKSPins routine is used to register filter drivers with Microsoft DirectShow that have no kernel streaming pins and, therefore, do not stream in kernel mode. |
| [StreamClassScheduleTimer function](nf-strmini-streamclassscheduletimer.md) | The minidriver calls the StreamClassScheduleTimer routine to schedule a timer, and to specify a routine that is called when the timer expires. |
| [StreamClassStreamNotification function](nf-strmini-streamclassstreamnotification.md) | Streams use the StreamClassStreamNotification routine to notify the class driver that it has completed a stream request, or that an event has occurred. |

## Callback functions

| Title   | Description   |
| ---- |:---- |
| [PHW_CANCEL_SRB callback](nc-strmini-phw_cancel_srb.md) | The class driver calls the minidriver's StrMiniCancelPacket routine to signal that a stream request has been canceled. |
| [PHW_EVENT_ROUTINE callback](nc-strmini-phw_event_routine.md) | The class driver calls the stream minidriver's StrMiniEvent routine to signal to a minidriver an event should be enabled or disabled. |
| [PHW_PRIORITY_ROUTINE callback](nc-strmini-phw_priority_routine.md) | StrMiniPriorityRoutine is a minidriver-supplied callback routine to be executed at a specified priority level. |
| [PHW_QUERY_CLOCK_ROUTINE callback](nc-strmini-phw_query_clock_routine.md) | Each stream may have a clock associated to it. The class driver queries the clock by calling the stream minidriver-supplied StrMiniClock function, provided in each stream's HW_STREAM_OBJECT. |
| [PHW_RECEIVE_DEVICE_SRB callback](nc-strmini-phw_receive_device_srb.md) | The minidriver-supplied StrMiniReceiveDevicePacket routine handles class driver requests that apply to the driver as a whole, such as initializing the device, or opening a stream within the device. |
| [PHW_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_HANDLER callback](nc-strmini-phw_request_timeout_handler.md) | The stream class driver calls the minidriver's StrMiniRequestTimeout routine to signal to the minidriver that a request has timed out. |

## Structures

| [KSSCATTER_GATHER structure](ns-strmini-ksscatter_gather.md) | . |
| [_HW_CLOCK_OBJECT structure](ns-strmini-_hw_clock_object.md) | The HW_CLOCK_OBJECT structure describes the clock associated with a stream. |
| [_HW_EVENT_DESCRIPTOR structure](ns-strmini-_hw_event_descriptor.md) | When the class driver calls one of the minidriver's StrMiniEvent routines, it passes a pointer to an HW_EVENT_DESCRIPTOR structure to describe the event as enabled or disabled. |
| [_HW_INITIALIZATION_DATA structure](ns-strmini-_hw_initialization_data.md) | The HW_INITIALIZATION_DATA structure specifies the basic information the class driver needs to begin initializing the minidriver. |
| [_HW_STREAM_DESCRIPTOR structure](ns-strmini-_hw_stream_descriptor.md) | The minidriver uses the HW_STREAM_DESCRIPTOR structure to return stream information to the stream class driver. |
| [_HW_STREAM_HEADER structure](ns-strmini-_hw_stream_header.md) | The HW_STREAM_HEADER structure describes the kernel streaming semantics supported by the minidriver as a whole, as part of a HW_STREAM_DESCRIPTOR structure. |
