# StreamClassReadWriteConfig function
The <b>StreamClassReadWriteConfig</b> routine reads or writes configuration data for the minidriver's parent bus driver.

## Syntax

```
BOOLEAN STREAMAPI StreamClassReadWriteConfig(
  PVOID   HwDeviceExtension,
  BOOLEAN Read,
  PVOID   Buffer,
  ULONG   Offset,
  ULONG   Length
);
```

## Parameters

`HwDeviceExtension`

Pointer to the minidriver's device extension. The minidriver specifies the size of this buffer in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559682">HW_INITIALIZATION_DATA</a> structure it passes when it registers itself via <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568263">StreamClassRegisterMinidriver</a>. The class driver then passes pointers to the buffer in the <b>HwDeviceExtension</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559702">HW_STREAM_REQUEST_BLOCK</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559697">HW_STREAM_OBJECT</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559706">HW_TIME_CONTEXT</a>, and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567785">PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION</a> structures it passes to the minidriver.

`Read`

Specifies whether to read or write the configuration information. A value of <b>TRUE</b> indicates that a read is requested. A value of <b>FALSE</b> indicates that a write should be performed.

`Buffer`

Points to the buffer to use to read/write the configuration information.

`Offset`

Specifies the offset within the configuration information to begin the read/write operation.

`Length`

Specifies the length of the data to read or write.


## Return Value

Returns <b>TRUE</b> on success, <b>FALSE</b> on failure.

## Remarks

This routine reads or writes configuration information for the minidriver's parent bus driver. For example, for a PCI device, <b>StreamClassReadWriteConfig</b> reads or writes PCI configuration information.

This routine can only be called at PASSIVE_LEVEL.
