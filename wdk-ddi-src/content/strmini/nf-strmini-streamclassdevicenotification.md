# StreamClassDeviceNotification function



## -description
Minidrivers use the <b>StreamClassDeviceNotification</b> routine to notify the class driver that it has completed a stream request, or that an event has occurred.



## -syntax

````
VOID  StreamClassDeviceNotification(
  _In_ STREAM_MINIDRIVER_DEVICE_NOTIFICATION_TYPE NotificationType,
  _In_ PVOID                                      HwDeviceExtension,
       PHW_STREAM_REQUEST_BLOCK                   pSrb,
       PKSEVENT_ENTRY                             EventEntry,
       GUID                                       *EventSet,
       ULONG                                      EventId
);
````


## -parameters

### -param NotificationType [in]

This is an enumeration value that contains the type of notification that the minidriver is sending.




### -param DeviceRequestComplete

Indicates that the minidriver has completed its handling of the device stream request block pointed to by the optional third argument of this routine, <i>pSrb</i>. Once the minidriver calls <b>StreamClassDeviceNotification</b> with this value, the relevant SRB is owned by the class driver, which is free to deallocate it.


### -param ReadyForNextDeviceRequest

Indicates that the minidriver is ready to receive another device request. 


### -param SignalDeviceEvent

Signals that the event specified by the <i>EventEntry</i> parameter has occurred.


### -param SignalMultipleDeviceEvents

Signals all events that match the criteria specified in the <i>EventSet</i> and <i>EventId</i> parameters.


### -param DeleteDeviceEvent

Deletes the event specified by the <i>EventEntry</i> parameter. 

</dd>
</dl>

### -param HwDeviceExtension [in]

Pointer to the minidriver's device extension. The minidriver specifies the size of this buffer in the <a href="stream.hw_initialization_data">HW_INITIALIZATION_DATA</a> structure it passes when it registers itself via <a href="stream.streamclassregisterminidriver">StreamClassRegisterMinidriver</a>. The class driver then passes pointers to the buffer in the <b>HwDeviceExtension</b> member of the <a href="stream.hw_stream_request_block">HW_STREAM_REQUEST_BLOCK</a>, <a href="stream.hw_stream_object">HW_STREAM_OBJECT</a>, <a href="stream.hw_time_context">HW_TIME_CONTEXT</a>, and <a href="stream.port_configuration_information">PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION</a> structures it passes to the minidriver.


### -param pSrb 

Pointer to an <a href="stream.hw_stream_request_block">HW_STREAM_REQUEST_BLOCK</a> structure. If <i>NotificationType</i> equals <b>DeviceRequestComplete</b>, this parameter points to the stream request block that the minidriver has completed processing. After <b>StreamClassDeviceNotification</b> completes, this address is no longer valid.


### -param EventEntry 

If <i>NotificationType</i> equals either SignalDeviceEvent or DeleteDeviceEvent, points to a structure of type <a href="stream.ksevent_entry">KSEVENT_ENTRY</a> that specifies the event to be signaled or deleted. 


### -param EventSet 

Specifies the event set to match against in the device event queue if <i>NotificationType</i> equals <b>SignalMultipleDeviceEvents</b>. 


### -param EventId 

Specifies the event ID to match against in the device event queue if <i>NotificationType</i> equals <b>SignalMultipleDeviceEvents</b>.


## -returns
None


## -remarks
The minidriver uses this routine for requests or events that apply to the minidriver as a whole. Stream-specific requests or events use <a href="stream.streamclassstreamnotification">StreamClassStreamNotification</a>.
