# StreamClassDeviceNotification function
Minidrivers use the <b>StreamClassDeviceNotification</b> routine to notify the class driver that it has completed a stream request, or that an event has occurred.

## Syntax

```
void StreamClassDeviceNotification(
  STREAM_MINIDRIVER_DEVICE_NOTIFICATION_TYPE NotificationType,
  PVOID                                      HwDeviceExtension,
  ...                                        
);
```

## Parameters

`NotificationType`

This is an enumeration value that contains the type of notification that the minidriver is sending.





#### DeviceRequestComplete

Indicates that the minidriver has completed its handling of the device stream request block pointed to by the optional third argument of this routine, <i>pSrb</i>. Once the minidriver calls <b>StreamClassDeviceNotification</b> with this value, the relevant SRB is owned by the class driver, which is free to deallocate it.



#### ReadyForNextDeviceRequest

Indicates that the minidriver is ready to receive another device request. 



#### SignalDeviceEvent

Signals that the event specified by the <i>EventEntry</i> parameter has occurred.



#### SignalMultipleDeviceEvents

Signals all events that match the criteria specified in the <i>EventSet</i> and <i>EventId</i> parameters.



#### DeleteDeviceEvent

Deletes the event specified by the <i>EventEntry</i> parameter.

`HwDeviceExtension`

Pointer to the minidriver's device extension. The minidriver specifies the size of this buffer in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559682">HW_INITIALIZATION_DATA</a> structure it passes when it registers itself via <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568263">StreamClassRegisterMinidriver</a>. The class driver then passes pointers to the buffer in the <b>HwDeviceExtension</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559702">HW_STREAM_REQUEST_BLOCK</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559697">HW_STREAM_OBJECT</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559706">HW_TIME_CONTEXT</a>, and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567785">PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION</a> structures it passes to the minidriver.

`Arg1`




## Return Value

None

## Remarks

The minidriver uses this routine for requests or events that apply to the minidriver as a whole. Stream-specific requests or events use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568266">StreamClassStreamNotification</a>.
