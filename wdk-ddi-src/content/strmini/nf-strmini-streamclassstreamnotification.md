## -description
Streams use the <b>StreamClassStreamNotification</b> routine to notify the class driver that it has completed a stream request, or that an event has occurred.



## -syntax

````
VOID  StreamClassStreamNotification(
  _In_ STREAM_MINIDRIVER_STREAM_NOTIFICATION_TYPE NotificationType,
  _In_ PHW_STREAM_OBJECT                          StreamObject,
       PHW_STREAM_REQUEST_BLOCK                   pSrb,
       PKSEVENT_ENTRY                             EventEntry,
       GUID                                       *EventSet,
       ULONG                                      EventId
);
````


## -parameters

### -param NotificationType [in]

This is an enumeration value that contains the type of notification that the minidriver is sending.




### -param StreamRequestComplete

Indicates that the minidriver has completed its handling of the stream-oriented stream request block that is pointed to by the optional third argument of this routine, <i>pSrb</i>.


### -param ReadyForNextStreamDataRequest

Indicates that this stream is ready to receive another data request. 


### -param ReadyForNextStreamControlRequest

Indicates that this stream is ready to receive another control request. 


### -param SignalStreamEvent

Signals that the event specified by the <i>EventEntry</i> parameter has occurred.


### -param SignalMultipleStreamEvents

Signals that all events that match the criteria specified in the <i>EventSet</i> and <i>EventId</i> parameters have occurred.


### -param DeleteStreamEvent

Deletes the event specified by the <i>EventEntry</i> parameter.

</dd>
</dl>

### -param StreamObject [in]

Points to the stream object of the stream that the class driver is being notified about.


### -param pSrb 

Pointer to an <a href="..\strmini\ns-strmini-_hw_stream_request_block.md">HW_STREAM_REQUEST_BLOCK</a> structure. Specify only if <i>NotificationType</i> equals <b>StreamRequestComplete</b>. Pointer to the stream request block that the minidriver has completed processing. Once this routine completes, this address is no longer valid. This parameter is optional.


### -param EventEntry 

Specify only if <i>NotificationType</i> equals either <b>SignalStreamEvent</b> or <b>DeleteStreamEvent</b>. Pointer to the event to be signaled or deleted. This parameter is optional. 


### -param EventSet 

Identifies the event set against which to match in the event queue for this stream. Specify only if <i>NotificationType</i> equals <b>SignalMultipleStreamEvents</b>. This parameter is optional. 


### -param EventId 

Indicates the event ID against which to match in the event queue for this stream. Specify only if <i>NotificationType</i> equals <b>SignalMultipleStreamEvents</b>. This parameter is optional.


## -returns
None


## -remarks
The minidriver uses this routine for requests or events that apply to the minidriver as a whole. Stream-specific requests or events use <a href="..\strmini\nf-strmini-streamclassdevicenotification.md">StreamClassDeviceNotification</a>.
