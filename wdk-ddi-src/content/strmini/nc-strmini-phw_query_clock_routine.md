# PHW_QUERY_CLOCK_ROUTINE callback function
Each stream may have a clock associated to it. The class driver queries the clock by calling the stream minidriver-supplied <i>StrMiniClock</i> function, provided in each stream's <a href="..\strmini\ns-strmini-_hw_stream_object.md">HW_STREAM_OBJECT</a>.

## Syntax

```
PHW_QUERY_CLOCK_ROUTINE PhwQueryClockRoutine;

void PhwQueryClockRoutine(
  IN PHW_TIME_CONTEXT TimeContext
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`TimeContext`




## Return Value

None

## Remarks

A stream specifies its <i>StrMiniClock</i> function within the <b>HwClockFunction</b> member of the <a href="..\strmini\ns-strmini-_hw_clock_object.md">HW_CLOCK_OBJECT</a> substructure of its <a href="..\strmini\ns-strmini-_hw_stream_object.md">HW_STREAM_OBJECT</a>. The minidriver fills out the <b>HW_STREAM_OBJECT</b> for a stream within its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff568463">StrMiniReceiveDevicePacket</a> routine in response to a SRB_OPEN_STREAM request.

When the class driver calls <i>StrMiniClock</i>, it fills in the <b>HwDeviceExtension</b>, <b>HwStreamObject</b>, and <b>Function</b> members of the <i>HwTimeContext</i> parameter. It expects <i>StrMiniClock</i> to fill in the <b>Time</b> member with the time value, in 100-nanosecond units, specified in the <i>Function</i> parameter. <i>StrMiniClock</i> must also fill in the <b>SystemTime</b> member with the current system time, by calling <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-kequeryperformancecounter.md">KeQueryPerformanceCounter</a>, and converting the result to 100-nanosecond units.

The <i>StrMiniClock</i> routine must handle the functions specified in the <b>ClockSupportFlags</b> of the clock's HW_CLOCK_OBJECT. See <a href="..\strmini\ns-strmini-_hw_clock_object.md">HW_CLOCK_OBJECT</a> for details.
