# _PMI_MEASUREMENT_CONFIGURATION structure



## -description
The PMI_MEASUREMENT_CONFIGURATION structure contains information about the current power measurement configuration of a power meter. 



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _PMI_MEASUREMENT_CONFIGURATION {
  ULONG AveragingInterval;
} PMI_MEASUREMENT_CONFIGURATION, *PPMI_MEASUREMENT_CONFIGURATION;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field AveragingInterval

A value, in units of milliseconds (mS), that specifies the interval during which the power meter averages power measurement data.


## -remarks
The PMI_MEASUREMENT_CONFIGURATION structure specifies the current measurement parameters that the power meter uses when it monitors the power that is consumed by the system from a power supply. The <b>AverageInterval</b> member specifies the time interval over which the power meter averages the power measurement data it collects from a power supply.
