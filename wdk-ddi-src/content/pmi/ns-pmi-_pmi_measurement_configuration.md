# _PMI_MEASUREMENT_CONFIGURATION structure
The PMI_MEASUREMENT_CONFIGURATION structure contains information about the current power measurement configuration of a power meter.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PMI_MEASUREMENT_CONFIGURATION {
  ULONG AveragingInterval;
} PMI_MEASUREMENT_CONFIGURATION, *PPMI_MEASUREMENT_CONFIGURATION;
````

## Members


`AveragingInterval`

A value, in units of milliseconds (mS), that specifies the interval during which the power meter averages power measurement data.

## Remarks
The PMI_MEASUREMENT_CONFIGURATION structure specifies the current measurement parameters that the power meter uses when it monitors the power that is consumed by the system from a power supply. The <b>AverageInterval</b> member specifies the time interval over which the power meter averages the power measurement data it collects from a power supply.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The <b>AverageInterval</b> member must have a value between the values of the <b>MinimumAverageInterval</b> and <b>MaximumAverageInterval</b> members of the <a href="..\pmi\ns-pmi-_pmi_reported_capabilities.md">PMI_REPORTED_CAPABILITIES</a> structure. This structure is returned in the <a href="..\pmi\ns-pmi-_pmi_capabilities.md">PMI_CAPABILITIES</a> structure of an <a href="..\pmi\ni-pmi-ioctl_pmi_get_capabilities.md">IOCTL_PMI_GET_CAPABILITIES</a> I/O control (IOCTL) query request.</div>
<div> </div>
