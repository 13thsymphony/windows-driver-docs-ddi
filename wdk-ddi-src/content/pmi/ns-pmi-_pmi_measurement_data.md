# _PMI_MEASUREMENT_DATA structure
The PMI_MEASUREMENT_DATA structure contains the current power measurement that is collected by a power meter.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PMI_MEASUREMENT_DATA {
  ULONG Version;
  ULONG CurrentPower;
} PMI_MEASUREMENT_DATA, *PPMI_MEASUREMENT_DATA;
````

## Members


`CurrentPower`

A value, in units of milliwatts (mW), that specifies the current power meter measurement.

`Version`

A value that specifies the version of this structure. For Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, and later versions of Windows, this value must be 1.

## Remarks
The PMI_MEASUREMENT_DATA structure is returned through an <a href="..\pmi\ni-pmi-ioctl_pmi_get_measurement.md">IOCTL_PMI_GET_MEASUREMENT</a> I/O control (IOCTL) query request. If the query request completes successfully, the request returns a PMI_MEASUREMENT_DATA structure.

## Requirements
