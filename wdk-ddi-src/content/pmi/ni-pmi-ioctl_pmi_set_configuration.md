# IOCTL_PMI_SET_CONFIGURATION IOCTL



## -description
The <b>IOCTL_PMI_SET_CONFIGURATION</b> request sets the configuration data for a power meter.



## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
The <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member of the I/O request packet (IRP) points to an initiator-allocated input buffer that contains a <a href="powermeter.pmi_configuration">PMI_CONFIGURATION</a> structure. This structure contains the configuration data.


### -input-buffer-length
The <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> member of the IRP's current I/O stack location (<a href="kernel.io_stack_location">IO_STACK_LOCATION</a>) is set to the size in bytes of the input buffer that is pointed to by the <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member. This size must be greater than or equal to <b>sizeof</b>(<b>PMI_CONFIGURATION</b>) or the request fails with an error status of STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL.


### -output-buffer
None.


### -output-buffer-length
None.


### -in-out-buffer

<text></text>

### -inout-buffer-length

<text></text>

### -status-block
I/O Status block
The <b>Information</b> member is set to the size, in bytes, of a <a href="powermeter.pmi_configuration">PMI_CONFIGURATION</a> structure.

The <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the following values:



The WDM driver that supports the PMI interface has completed the IOCTL request successfully. 

The <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.OutputBufferLength</b> member of the <a href="kernel.irp">IRP</a> is less than the size, in bytes, of a <a href="powermeter.pmi_configuration">PMI_CONFIGURATION</a> structure. 


## -remarks
The <b>IOCTL_PMI_SET_CONFIGURATION</b> request sets the configuration parameters for the power meter. The <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member of the IRP references a buffer that contains a <a href="powermeter.pmi_configuration">PMI_CONFIGURATION</a> structure. The <b>ConfigurationType</b> member of this structure contains information about the type of PMI configuration data to set in the power meter.

Only PMI configuration data that the power meter supports with read/write permissions can be changed by using a set request of <b>IOCTL_PMI_SET_CONFIGURATION</b>. A set request of <b>IOCTL_PMI_SET_CONFIGURATION</b> to change read-only PMI configuration data will fail, and the data will not be changed on the power meter.
