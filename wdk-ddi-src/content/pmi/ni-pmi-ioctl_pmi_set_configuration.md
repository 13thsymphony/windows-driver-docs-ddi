# IOCTL_PMI_SET_CONFIGURATION IOCTL
The <b>IOCTL_PMI_SET_CONFIGURATION</b> request sets the configuration data for a power meter.

### Major Code
[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](xref:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control")

### Input Buffer
The <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member of the I/O request packet (IRP) points to an initiator-allocated input buffer that contains a <a href="..\pmi\ns-pmi-_pmi_configuration.md">PMI_CONFIGURATION</a> structure. This structure contains the configuration data.

### Input Buffer Length
The <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> member of the IRP's current I/O stack location (<a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_io_stack_location.md">IO_STACK_LOCATION</a>) is set to the size in bytes of the input buffer that is pointed to by the <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member. This size must be greater than or equal to <b>sizeof</b>(<b>PMI_CONFIGURATION</b>) or the request fails with an error status of STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL.

### Output Buffer
None.

### Output Buffer Length
None.

### Input / Output Buffer
<text></text>

### Input / Output Buffer Length
<text></text>

### Status Block
The <b>Information</b> member is set to the size, in bytes, of a <a href="..\pmi\ns-pmi-_pmi_configuration.md">PMI_CONFIGURATION</a> structure.

The <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the following values:

## Remarks
The <b>IOCTL_PMI_SET_CONFIGURATION</b> request sets the configuration parameters for the power meter. The <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member of the IRP references a buffer that contains a <a href="..\pmi\ns-pmi-_pmi_configuration.md">PMI_CONFIGURATION</a> structure. The <b>ConfigurationType</b> member of this structure contains information about the type of PMI configuration data to set in the power meter.

Only PMI configuration data that the power meter supports with read/write permissions can be changed by using a set request of <b>IOCTL_PMI_SET_CONFIGURATION</b>. A set request of <b>IOCTL_PMI_SET_CONFIGURATION</b> to change read-only PMI configuration data will fail, and the data will not be changed on the power meter.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Beginning with Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, the power meter can also support read/write permissions to its budgeting information. For more information, see <a href="..\pmi\ns-pmi-_pmi_reported_capabilities.md">PMI_REPORTED_CAPABILITIES</a>.</div><div> </div>
