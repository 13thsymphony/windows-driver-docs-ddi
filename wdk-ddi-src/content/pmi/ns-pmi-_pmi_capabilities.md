# _PMI_CAPABILITIES structure
The PMI_CAPABILITIES structure contains information about the power metering and budgeting capabilities of a power meter.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PMI_CAPABILITIES {
  ULONG                 Version;
  ULONG                 Size;
  PMI_CAPABILITIES_TYPE CapabilityType;
  union {
    PMI_REPORTED_CAPABILITIES        ReportedCapabilities;
    PMI_METERED_HARDWARE_INFORMATION MeteredHardwareInformation;
  } Capabilities;
} PMI_CAPABILITIES, *PPMI_CAPABILITIES;
````

## Members


`Capabilities`

A union of the supported Power Meter Interface (PMI) capability structures. Based on the value of the <b>CapabilityType</b> member, one of the following <b>Capabilities</b> submembers is used to reference the following PMI capability structures:

`CapabilityType`

A <a href="..\pmi\ne-pmi-pmi_capabilities_type.md">PMI_CAPABILITIES_TYPE</a> enumeration value that specifies the data type of the <b>Capabilities</b> member.

`Size`

A value, in units of bytes, that specifies the size of the structure.

`Version`

A value that specifies the version of this structure. For Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, and later versions of Windows, this value must be 1.

## Remarks
The PMI_CAPABILITIES structure is used to query many PMI capabilities that are supported by a power meter. 

The PMI capability information is returned through an <a href="..\pmi\ni-pmi-ioctl_pmi_get_capabilities.md">IOCTL_PMI_GET_CAPABILITIES</a> I/O control (IOCTL) query request. The input data for this query request is set to a <a href="..\pmi\ne-pmi-pmi_capabilities_type.md">PMI_CAPABILITIES_TYPE</a> enumerator value that specifies the type of PMI capability data to return.

If the IOCTL query request completes successfully, the request returns a PMI_CAPABILITIES structure. The <b>Capabilities</b> member of this structure contains data formatted as the requested PMI capabilities structure.

For example, if an IOCTL query request of <a href="..\pmi\ni-pmi-ioctl_pmi_get_capabilities.md">IOCTL_PMI_GET_CAPABILITIES</a> is made with the input data set to <b>PmiReportedCapabilities</b> and the request completes successfully, the request returns a PMI_CAPABILITIES structure with its members set to the following values:
<ul>
<li>
The <b>CapabilitiesType</b> member is set to <b>PmiReportedCapabilities</b>.

</li>
<li>
The <b>Capabilities</b> member contains data that is formatted as a <a href="..\pmi\ns-pmi-_pmi_reported_capabilities.md">PMI_REPORTED_CAPABILITIES</a> structure.

</li>
</ul>
