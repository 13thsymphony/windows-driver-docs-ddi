# _DXGK_ALLOCATIONLIST structure



## -description
The <b>DXGK_ALLOCATIONLIST</b> structure describes an allocation specification that is used in direct memory access (DMA) buffering.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _DXGK_ALLOCATIONLIST {
  HANDLE           hDeviceSpecificAllocation;
  struct {
    UINT WriteOperation  :1;
    UINT SegmentId  :5;
    UINT Reserved  :26;
  };
#if (DXGKDDI_INTERFACE_VERSION >= DXGKDDI_INTERFACE_VERSION_WDDM2_0)
  union {
    PHYSICAL_ADDRESS       PhysicalAddress;
    D3DGPU_VIRTUAL_ADDRESS VirtualAddress;
  };
#else 
  PHYSICAL_ADDRESS PhysicalAddress;
#endif 
} DXGK_ALLOCATIONLIST;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field hDeviceSpecificAllocation

[in/out] An open handle to the allocation that is being referenced (that is, the handle that the driver returned in the <b>hDeviceSpecificAllocation</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_openallocationinfo.md">DXGK_OPENALLOCATIONINFO</a> structure for the allocation in a call to the driver's <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_openallocationinfo.md">DxgkDdiOpenAllocation</a> function).


### -field ( unnamed struct )

Â 


### -field WriteOperation

[in/out] A member in the structure that <b>DXGK_ALLOCATIONLIST</b> contains that can hold information about whether the allocation can be written to. Setting this member to 1 indicates that the allocation can be written to anywhere in the DMA buffer.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of a 32-bit value (0x00000001). 


### -field SegmentId

[in/out] A member in the structure that <b>DXGK_ALLOCATIONLIST</b> contains that can hold information about the identifier of a segment that the allocation was last paged in at. Setting this member to 0 indicates that no pre-patching information is available.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the second through sixth bit of a 32-bit value (0x0000002E). 


### -field Reserved

[in] A member in the structure that <b>DXGK_ALLOCATIONLIST</b> contains that is reserved. This member should be set to 0.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the remaining 26 bits (0xFFFFFFC0) of a 32-bit value to zeros. 

</dd>
</dl>

### -field PhysicalAddress

[in/out] A <b>PHYSICAL_ADDRESS</b> data type (which is defined as <b>LARGE_INTEGER</b>) that indicates the physical address, within the segment that <b>SegmentId</b> specifies, where the allocation was last paged-in at. This member is set to zero if no pre-patching information is available.

Supported starting with Windows 10.


### -field VirtualAddress

[in/out] A <b>D3DGPU_VIRTUAL_ADDRESS</b> data type that indicates the virtual address.

Supported starting with Windows 10.


### -field PhysicalAddress

[in/out] A <b>PHYSICAL_ADDRESS</b> data type (which is defined as <b>LARGE_INTEGER</b>) that indicates the physical address, within the segment that <b>SegmentId</b> specifies, where the allocation was last paged-in at. This member is set to zero if no pre-patching information is available.


## -remarks
In the display miniport driver's <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_render.md">DxgkDdiRender</a> function, the driver generates a list of <b>DXGK_ALLOCATIONLIST</b> structures for allocation specifications that will be used in a direct memory access (DMA) buffer. The video memory manager uses the list to split and patch DMA buffers appropriately.
