# _D3DKM_TRANSPARENTBLTFLAGS structure



## -description
The D3DKM_TRANSPARENTBLTFLAGS structure specifies the display adapter's ability to perform a hardware-accelerated bit-block transfer (bitblt) with transparency.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _D3DKM_TRANSPARENTBLTFLAGS {
  union {
    struct {
      UINT HonorAlpha  :1;
    };
    UINT   Value;
  };
} D3DKM_TRANSPARENTBLTFLAGS;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field HonorAlpha

[in] A UINT value that specifies in a hardware-accelerated transparent bit-block transfer whether the alpha channel should be used during comparison:

<dl>
<dd>
1 = The display adapter does not ignore the alpha channel when it compares the reference color with the source color.

</dd>
<dd>
0 = The display adapter ignores the alpha channel when it compares the reference color with the source color.

</dd>
</dl>
Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000001).


### -field Value

[in] A member in the union that D3DKM_TRANSPARENTBLTFLAGS contains. This member can hold a 32-bit value that specifies the display adapter's ability to perform hardware-accelerated bit-block transfer with transparency.


## -remarks
