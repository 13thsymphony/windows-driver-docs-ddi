## -struct-fields

### -field ConnectionChangeId

The per target unique id for the transition being reported.  This value must be unique across all targets on the adapter and must be monotonically increasing for each change reported.


### -field TargetId

The target id for which the change is being reported.  This target id must have been reported to the OS before and must be in a state which supports the given change.


### -field ConnectionStatus

The status of the connection.


### -field Reserved

This value is reserved for system use.


### -field MonitorConnect


### -field MonitorConnect.LinkTargetType

This is the video output technology of the monitor which has been connected.  Internal and Miracast are not allowed so only the following values are allowed:

<dl>
<dd>D3DKMDT_VOT_OTHER</dd>
<dd>D3DKMDT_VOT_HD15</dd>
<dd>D3DKMDT_VOT_SVIDEO</dd>
<dd>D3DKMDT_VOT_COMPOSITE_VIDEO</dd>
<dd>D3DKMDT_VOT_COMPONENT_VIDEO</dd>
<dd>D3DKMDT_VOT_DVI</dd>
<dd>D3DKMDT_VOT_HDMI</dd>
<dd>D3DKMDT_VOT_D_JPN</dd>
<dd>D3DKMDT_VOT_SDI</dd>
<dd>D3DKMDT_VOT_DISPLAYPORT_EXTERNAL</dd>
<dd>D3DKMDT_VOT_UDI_EXTERNAL</dd>
<dd>D3DKMDT_VOT_SDTVDONGLE</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

### -field TargetConnect


### -field TargetConnect.BaseTargetType

This is the video output technology of connector of the new target.  As with MonitorConnect.LinkTargetType,  Internal and Miracast are not allowed so the same target types as listed above are allowed.


### -field TargetConnect.NewTargetId

The target id for which the change is being reported.  This target id must have been reported to the OS before and must be in a state which supports the given change.  

</dd>
</dl>

### -field TargetJoin


### -field TargetJoin.BaseTargetType

This is the video output technology of the connector of the new target.  As with MonitorConnect.LinkTargetType,  Internal and Miracast are not allowed so the same target types as listed above are allowed.  

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The same BaseTargetType must be reported for all targets which are being joined to each other.</div>
<div> </div>

### -field TargetJoin.NewTargetId

The target id for which the change is being reported.  This target id must have been reported to the OS before and must be in a state which supports the given change.  

</dd>
</dl>
