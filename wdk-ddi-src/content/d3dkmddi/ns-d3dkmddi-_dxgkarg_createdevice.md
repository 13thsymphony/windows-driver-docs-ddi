# _DXGKARG_CREATEDEVICE structure
The DXGKARG_CREATEDEVICE structure describes a graphics context device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DXGKARG_CREATEDEVICE {
  HANDLE hDevice;
  union {
    DXGK_CREATEDEVICEFLAGS Flags;
    DXGK_DEVICEINFO        *pInfo;
  };
#if (DXGKDDI_INTERFACE_VERSION >= DXGKDDI_INTERFACE_VERSION_WDDM2_0)
  ULONG  Pasid;
  HANDLE hKmdProcess;
#endif 
} DXGKARG_CREATEDEVICE;
````

## Members


`hDevice`

A handle to the graphics context device. On input to the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_createdevice.md">DxgkDdiCreateDevice</a> function, <b>hDevice</b> specifies the handle that the driver should use when it calls back into the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem. 

The driver generates a unique handle and passes it back to the DirectX graphics subsystem. On output from the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_createdevice.md">DxgkDdiCreateDevice</a> function, <b>hDevice</b> specifies the handle that the DirectX graphics subsystem should use in subsequent driver calls to identify the device.

`hKmdProcess`

A handle to the corresponding kernel mode driver process object.

Supported starting with Windows 10.

`Pasid`

The owner process PASID for a support vector machine GPU.

Supported starting with Windows 10.
