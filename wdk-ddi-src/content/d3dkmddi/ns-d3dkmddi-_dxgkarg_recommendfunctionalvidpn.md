# _DXGKARG_RECOMMENDFUNCTIONALVIDPN structure
The DXGKARG_RECOMMENDFUNCTIONALVIDPN structure contains arguments for the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_recommendfunctionalvidpn.md">DxgkDdiRecommendFunctionalVidPn</a> function. The <i>DxgkDdiRecommendFunctionalVidPn</i> function creates a functional video present network (VidPN) that can be implemented on a specified display adapter.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DXGKARG_RECOMMENDFUNCTIONALVIDPN {
  UINT                                 NumberOfVidPnTargets;
  const D3DDDI_VIDEO_PRESENT_TARGET_ID *pVidPnTargetPrioritizationVector;
  D3DKMDT_HVIDPN                       hRecommendedFunctionalVidPn;
  DXGK_RECOMMENDFUNCTIONALVIDPN_REASON RequestReason;
  OPTIONAL VOID                        *pPrivateDriverData;
  UINT                                 PrivateDriverDataSize;
} DXGKARG_RECOMMENDFUNCTIONALVIDPN;
````

## Members


`hRecommendedFunctionalVidPn`

A handle, provided by the caller, to an empty VidPN object. <i>DxgkDdiRecommendFunctionalVidPn</i> must add a path (source-target pair) to the VidPN's topology and must pin modes on the path's source and target. For information about adding paths to a topology and creating mode sets for video present sources and targets, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5dedac8c-9a99-4b3a-81be-39819135cd97">VidPN Objects and Interfaces</a>.

`NumberOfVidPnTargets`

Reserved for future use.

`pPrivateDriverData`

A pointer to a buffer that contains private data that is passed from a user-mode application to the display miniport driver.

`PrivateDriverDataSize`

The size, in bytes, of the data block pointed to by <i>pPrivateDriverData</i>.

`pVidPnTargetPrioritizationVector`

Reserved for future use.

`RequestReason`

A <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ne-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_recommendfunctionalvidpn_reason.md">DXGK_RECOMMENDFUNCTIONALVIDPN_REASON</a> value that indicates why the caller is requesting a functional VidPN.
