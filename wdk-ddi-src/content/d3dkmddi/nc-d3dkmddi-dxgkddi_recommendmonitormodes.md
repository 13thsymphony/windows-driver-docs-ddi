# DXGKDDI_RECOMMENDMONITORMODES callback function
The <i>DxgkDdiRecommendMonitorModes</i> function inspects the monitor source mode set that is associated with a particular video present target and possibly adds modes to the set.

## Syntax

```
DXGKDDI_RECOMMENDMONITORMODES DxgkddiRecommendmonitormodes;

NTSTATUS DxgkddiRecommendmonitormodes(
  IN_CONST_HANDLE hAdapter,
  IN_CONST_PDXGKARG_RECOMMENDMONITORMODES_CONST pRecommendMonitorModes
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`hAdapter`

A handle to a context block that is associated with a display adapter. The display miniport driver previously provided this handle to the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem in the <i>MiniportDeviceContext</i> output parameter of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5fd4046f-54c3-4dfc-8d51-0d9ebcde0bea">DxgkDdiAddDevice</a> function.

`pRecommendMonitorModes`




## Return Value

<i>DxgkDdiRecommendMonitorModes</i> returns one of the following values:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The function succeeded.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_NO_MEMORY</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The function failed because it was unable to allocate enough memory.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
Â 

The miniport driver should pass through any error code that it gets from the operating system for which it does not have a fallback code path.

## Remarks

<i>DxgkDdiRecommendMonitorModes</i> should be made pageable.
