## -struct-fields

### -field pDmaBuffer

[in/out] A virtual address to the first available byte in the paging buffer. When the driver is first called with a new paging buffer, this virtual address is aligned on 4 KB. The driver tightly packs operations in the paging buffer until the paging buffer is full and then uses a new paging buffer. Therefore, if the graphics processing unit (GPU) requires a specific alignment for a paging-buffer submission, the driver should enforce this alignment by padding the operations that it writes to the paging buffer. Before the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_buildpagingbuffer.md">DxgkDdiBuildPagingBuffer</a> function returns, the driver should update <b>pDmaBuffer</b> to point past the last byte that is written to the paging buffer. 


### -field DmaSize

[in/out] The size, in bytes, of the paging buffer that <b>pDmaBuffer</b> specifies.


### -field pDmaBufferPrivateData

[in/out] A pointer to a driver-resident private data structure that is associated with the direct memory access (DMA) buffer (that is, paging buffer) that <b>pDmaBuffer</b> specifies.


### -field DmaBufferPrivateDataSize

[in/out] The number of bytes that remain in the private data structure that <b>pDmaBufferPrivateData</b> points to for the current operation.


### -field Operation

[in] A <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ne-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_buildpagingbuffer_operation.md">DXGK_BUILDPAGINGBUFFER_OPERATION</a>-typed value that indicates the type of memory operation to perform. 


### -field MultipassOffset

[in/out] A UINT value that specifies the progress of the paging operation if multiple paging buffers are required. The driver sets this value to indicate a split into multiple paging buffers for more than one transfer operation. For example, the driver can store the page number that was last transferred for a paged-based transfer. 


### -field Transfer

[in] A structure that describes the transfer operation.


### -field hAllocation

[in] A handle to the allocation that the driver's <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_createallocation.md">DxgkDdiCreateAllocation</a> function previously returned in the <b>hAllocation</b> member of a <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_allocationinfo.md">DXGK_ALLOCATIONINFO</a> structure, which is part of the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_createallocation.md">DXGKARG_CREATEALLOCATION</a> structure's <b>pAllocationInfo</b> member. The allocation handle points to a buffer that contains private driver data for the transfer.


### -field TransferOffset

[in] The offset, in bytes, of the first page within the allocation that is transferred. This offset is applied only to a location that a segment location describes. This offset does not apply to an <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_mdl.md">MDL</a> description of a memory range. If the driver requires more than one paging buffer to complete the transfer (that is, the driver returns STATUS_GRAPHICS_INSUFFICIENT_DMA_BUFFER from its <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_buildpagingbuffer.md">DxgkDdiBuildPagingBuffer</a> function), <b>TransferOffset</b> is the same for each call to <i>DxgkDdiBuildPagingBuffer</i> for this transfer.


### -field TransferSize

[in] The size, in bytes, of the memory information to transfer.


### -field Source

[in] A structure that describes the source allocation. This structure contains a <b>SegmentId</b> member and a union that contains either an offset into a segment of the source allocation (<b>SegmentAddress</b>) or a pointer to an <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_mdl.md">MDL</a> for the source (<b>pMdl</b>).


### -field SegmentId

[in] The identifier of a segment within the source allocation, or zero if the source allocation is described by the <b>pMdl</b> member of the union that <b>Source</b> contains.


### -field SegmentAddress

[in] A pointer to a buffer that contains the <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_mdl.md">MDL</a> structure that describes the system memory pages for the source, if the <b>SegmentId</b> member of <b>Source</b> is zero.

</dd>
</dl>

### -field Destination

[in] A structure that describes the destination allocation. This structure contains a <b>SegmentId</b> member and a union that contains either an offset into a segment of the destination allocation (<b>SegmentAddress</b>) or a pointer to an <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_mdl.md">MDL</a> for the destination (<b>pMdl</b>).


### -field SegmentId

[in] The identifier of a segment within the destination allocation, or zero if the destination allocation is described by the <b>pMdl</b> member of the union that <b>Destination</b> contains.


### -field SegmentAddress

[in] The destination segment address, if the <b>SegmentId</b> member of <b>Destination</b> is nonzero. The DirectX graphics kernel subsystem computes the segment address as the sum of the segment offset and the base address of the segment: <code>SegmentAddress = SegmentOffset + Segment.BaseAddr</code>.

[in] A pointer to a buffer that contains the <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_mdl.md">MDL</a> structure that describes the system memory pages for the destination, if the <b>SegmentId</b> member of <b>Destination</b> is zero.

</dd>
</dl>

### -field Flags

[in] A <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_transferflags.md">DXGK_TRANSFERFLAGS</a> structure that identifies, in bit-field flags, the type of special-lock-transfer operation to perform.

[in] The offset, in system memory pages, within the <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_mdl.md">MDL</a> structure that the <b>pMdl</b> member points to, to the first system memory page for the current operation. The driver can obtain the physical address of the first system memory page by calling the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554537">MmGetMdlPfnArray</a> function as follows.
