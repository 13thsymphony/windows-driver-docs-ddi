# _DXGK_POINTERFLAGS structure



## -description
The DXGK_POINTERFLAGS structure identifies mouse pointer capabilities of the display miniport driver that the driver provides through a call to its <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_queryadapterinfo.md">DxgkDdiQueryAdapterInfo</a> function.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _DXGK_POINTERFLAGS {
  union {
    struct {
      UINT Monochrome  :1;
      UINT Color  :1;
      UINT MaskedColor  :1;
      UINT Reserved  :29;
    };
    UINT Value;
  };
} DXGK_POINTERFLAGS;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Monochrome

A UINT value that specifies whether the mouse pointer can display in monochrome. Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000001).


### -field Color

A UINT value that specifies whether the mouse pointer can display in color and with transparency (alpha). Setting this member is equivalent to setting the second bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000002).


### -field MaskedColor

A UINT value that specifies whether the mouse pointer can display in color and with a mask value in the transparency (alpha) bits. Setting this member is equivalent to setting the third bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000004).


### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member to zero is equivalent to setting the remaining 29 bits (0xFFFFFFF8) of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member to zeros.


### -field Value

A member in the union that DXGK_POINTERFLAGS contains that can hold a 32-bit value that identifies mouse pointer capabilities.


## -remarks
The display miniport driver can specify mouse pointer capabilities by setting bits in the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member or by setting individual members of the structure in the union that DXGK_POINTERFLAGS contains.

The driver always specifies a color mouse pointer by using a A8R8G8B8 pixel format.
