# _DXGKARG_OPENALLOCATION structure
The DXGKARG_OPENALLOCATION structure describes allocations that the display miniport driver should open.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DXGKARG_OPENALLOCATION {
  UINT                     NumAllocations;
  DXGK_OPENALLOCATIONINFO  *pOpenAllocation;
  VOID                     *pPrivateDriverData;
  UINT                     PrivateDriverSize;
  DXGK_OPENALLOCATIONFLAGS Flags;
#if (DXGKDDI_INTERFACE_VERSION >= DXGKDDI_INTERFACE_VERSION_WIN8)
  UINT                     SubresourceIndex;
  SIZE_T                   SubresourceOffset;
  UINT                     Pitch;
#endif 
} DXGKARG_OPENALLOCATION;
````

## Members


`Flags`

[in] A <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_openallocationflags.md">DXGK_OPENALLOCATIONFLAGS</a> structure that identifies the operation to perform for allocations.

`NumAllocations`

[in] The number of elements in the array that the <b>pOpenAllocation</b> member specifies, which represents the number of device-specific allocations to open.

`Pitch`

[out] Supported beginning with Windows 8.

The pitch, in bytes, of the allocation—that is, the distance, in bytes, to the start of the next row.

`pOpenAllocation`

[in/out] An array of <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_openallocationinfo.md">DXGK_OPENALLOCATIONINFO</a> structures for the allocations to open.

`pPrivateDriverData`

[in] A pointer to a block of private data that is passed from the user-mode display driver to the display miniport driver. This block of private data is the same resource-specific data that is passed in the <b>pPrivateDriverData</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_createallocation.md">DXGKARG_CREATEALLOCATION</a> structure in the call to the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_createallocation.md">DxgkDdiCreateAllocation</a> function. The display miniport driver cannot modify this block of private data.

`PrivateDriverSize`

[in] The size, in bytes, of the block of private data that <b>pPrivateDriverData</b> points to.

`SubresourceIndex`

[in] Supported beginning with Windows 8.

An index into the resource for the render target surface.

The operating system specifies this member only if the display miniport driver supports <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/03db58e6-a6d5-4b6f-ba71-d22a985f9c57">GDI Hardware Acceleration</a>. Specifically, the display miniport driver must implement  the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_renderkm.md">DxgkDdiRenderKm</a> function and must create the device with the <b>GdiDevice</b> member set in <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_createdevice.md">DXGKARG_CREATEDEVICE</a>.<b>Flags</b>.

If the value of <b>SubresourceIndex</b> is greater than the number of subresources in the allocation, the display miniport driver should return an error.

`SubresourceOffset`

[out] Supported beginning with Windows 8.

The offset, in bytes, from the start of the allocation to the start of the subresource.
