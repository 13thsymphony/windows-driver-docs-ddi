## Members


`BytesPerPixel`

The number of bytes per pixel in the source image.

`Flags`

A <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_d3dkmt_present_display_only_flags.md">D3DKMT_PRESENT_DISPLAY_ONLY_FLAGS</a> structure that identifies how to display the source image in the present operation.

`NumDirtyRects`

The number of dirty rectangles that are pointed to by the <b>pDirtyRect</b> member.

`NumMoves`

The number of screen-to-screen moves that are pointed to by the <b>pMoves</b> member.

`pDirtyRect`

A pointer to a list of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569234">RECT</a> dirty rectangles.

`pfnPresentDisplayOnlyProgress`

Reserved for system use. The operating system sets this member to <b>NULL</b>.

`Pitch`

The pitch, in bytes, of each line in the source image—that is, the distance, in bytes, to the start of the next line.

`pMoves`

A pointer to a list of <a href="..\d3dkmdt\ns-d3dkmdt-_d3dkmt_move_rect.md">D3DKMT_MOVE_RECT</a> screen-to-screen moves.

`pSource`

The virtual start address of the source image.

`VidPnSourceId`

The zero-based identification number of the video present source in a path of a video present network (VidPN) topology on which to restrict displaying.
