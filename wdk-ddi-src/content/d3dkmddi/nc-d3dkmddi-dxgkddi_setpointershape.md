# DXGKDDI_SETPOINTERSHAPE function
The <i>DxgkDdiSetPointerShape</i> function sets the appearance and location of the mouse pointer.

## Syntax

```
DXGKDDI_SETPOINTERSHAPE DxgkddiSetpointershape;

NTSTATUS DxgkddiSetpointershape(
  IN_CONST_HANDLE hAdapter,
  IN_CONST_PDXGKARG_SETPOINTERSHAPE pSetPointerShape
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`hAdapter`

[in] A handle to a context block that is associated with a display adapter. The display miniport driver previously provided this handle to the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem in the <i>MiniportDeviceContext</i> output parameter of the <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_add_device.md">DxgkDdiAddDevice</a> function.

`pSetPointerShape`

[in] A pointer to a <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_setpointershape.md">DXGKARG_SETPOINTERSHAPE</a> structure that describes the appearance and location of the mouse pointer.


## Return Value

<i>DxgkDdiSetPointerShape</i> returns one of the following values:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The mouse pointer is successfully drawn.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_NO_MEMORY</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
<i>DxgkDdiSetPointerShape</i> could not allocate memory that was required for it to complete.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

The DirectX graphics kernel subsystem calls the display miniport driver's <i>DxgkDdiSetPointerShape</i> function to set information about the mouse pointer. The <i>DxgkDdiSetPointerShape</i> function is called independently of all of the other display miniport driver functions. Therefore, a <i>DxgkDdiSetPointerShape</i> thread can run simultaneously with another display miniport driver thread. However, the system ensures that <i>DxgkDdiSetPointerShape</i> and <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_setpointerposition.md">DxgkDdiSetPointerPosition</a> threads cannot run simultaneously. 

If you run a <i>DxgkDdiSetPointerShape</i> thread simultaneously with another display miniport driver thread, the display miniport driver should be able to program the mouse pointer hardware independently of other activities, such as operations that send a command buffer through direct memory access (DMA) to the graphics hardware, operations that program the graphics hardware by using memory-mapped I/O (MMIO), and so on.

<i>DxgkDdiSetPointerShape</i> is not called if the video present network (VidPN) topology that is associated with the <b>VidPnSourceId</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_setpointershape.md">DXGKARG_SETPOINTERSHAPE</a> structure that the <i>pSetPointerShape</i> parameter points to is disabled.

<i>DxgkDdiSetPointerShape</i> should be made pageable.
