# DXGKCB_ENUMHANDLECHILDREN callback function
The <b>DxgkCbEnumHandleChildren</b> function enumerates all of the allocations that are associated with a given resource, one allocation at a time.

## Syntax

```
DXGKCB_ENUMHANDLECHILDREN DxgkcbEnumhandlechildren;

D3DKMT_HANDLE DxgkcbEnumhandlechildren(

)
{...}
```

## Parameters

This function has no parameters.

## Return Value

<i>DxgkCbEnumHandleChildren</i> returns the graphics subsystem-specific handle to the child allocation that the <i>pData</i> parameter describes. To retrieve the device-specific data for the handle, the display miniport driver must call the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkcb_gethandledata.md">DxgkCbGetHandleData</a> function.

<i>DxgkCbEnumHandleChildren</i> returns a <b>NULL</b> handle if the child-allocation index that the <b>Index</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkargcb_enumhandlechildren.md">DXGKARGCB_ENUMHANDLECHILDREN</a> structure supplies exceeds the number of allocations that are associated with the parent resource. If <i>DxgkCbEnumHandleChildren</i> unexpectedly returns a <b>NULL</b> handle, the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem was unable to resolve the handle to the parent resource because, for example, of the following possible reasons:
<ul>
<li>An invalid handle was received from the user-mode display driver because of a malicious attack or some other bug. </li>
<li>Allocations had lifetime issues. </li>
</ul>If a <b>NULL</b> handle is returned unexpectedly, the display miniport driver should fail its currently running DDI function with STATUS_INVALID_HANDLE.

## Remarks

The display miniport driver can call the <b>DxgkCbEnumHandleChildren</b> function in a loop to enumerate all of the allocations that are associated with a resource. If the display miniport driver sets the <b>Index</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkargcb_enumhandlechildren.md">DXGKARGCB_ENUMHANDLECHILDREN</a> structure that is pointed to by the <i>pData</i> parameter to 0, <b>DxgkCbEnumHandleChildren</b> returns the first allocation handle; if <b>Index</b> is set to 1, <b>DxgkCbEnumHandleChildren</b> returns the second allocation handle; and so on. If <b>Index</b> is greater than the number of allocations that are associated with the resource, <b>DxgkCbEnumHandleChildren</b> returns <b>NULL</b>.
