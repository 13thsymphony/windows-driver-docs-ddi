# _DXGK_PRESENTMULTIPLANEOVERLAYLIST structure



## -description
Specifies an overlay plane to display in a call to the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_present.md">DxgkDdiPresent</a> function.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _DXGK_PRESENTMULTIPLANEOVERLAYLIST {
  UINT             LayerIndex;
  BOOL             Enabled;
  HANDLE           hDeviceSpecificAllocation;
  struct {
    UINT SegmentId  :5;
    UINT Reserved  :27;
  };

} DXGK_PRESENTMULTIPLANEOVERLAYLIST;

## -struct-fields

### -field LayerIndex

The zero-based index of the overlay plane to display. The top plane (in the z-direction) has index zero. The planes' index values must be sequential from top to bottom.


### -field Enabled

Indicates whether the overlay plane specified by <b>LayerIndex</b> is enabled for display.


### -field hDeviceSpecificAllocation

A handle to the device-specific allocation that corresponds to the non device-specific allocation. The display miniport driver must set <b>hDeviceSpecificAllocation</b> to a handle value that it can use to refer to its private tracking structure for the allocation.


### -field SegmentId

[in] The identifier of a segment that data is read from.


### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero.


### -field PhysicalAddress

[in] A <b>PHYSICAL_ADDRESS</b> data type (which is defined as <b>LARGE_INTEGER</b>) that indicates the physical address, within the segment that <b>SegmentId</b> specifies, where the data is read.
