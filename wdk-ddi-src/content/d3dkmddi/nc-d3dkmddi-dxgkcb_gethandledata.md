# DXGKCB_GETHANDLEDATA callback function
The <i>DxgkCbGetHandleData</i> function retrieves the private data that is associated with an allocation.

## Syntax

```
DXGKCB_GETHANDLEDATA DxgkcbGethandledata;

VOID * DxgkcbGethandledata(

)
{...}
```

## Parameters

This function has no parameters.

## Return Value

<i>DxgkCbGetHandleData</i> returns a buffer that contains the private data for the allocation.

If <i>DxgkCbGetHandleData</i> returns a <b>NULL</b> pointer, the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem was unable to resolve the handle that is supplied in the <b>hObject</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkargcb_gethandledata.md">DXGKARGCB_GETHANDLEDATA</a> structure to private data because, for example, of the following possible reasons: 

<ul>
<li>An invalid handle was received from the user-mode display driver because of a malicious attack or some other bug. </li>
<li>Allocations had lifetime issues. </li>
</ul>
If a <b>NULL</b> pointer is returned, the display miniport driver should fail its currently running DDI function with STATUS_INVALID_HANDLE.

## Remarks

When the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem calls the display miniport driver's <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_createallocation.md">DxgkDdiCreateAllocation</a> function to create handles to allocations, the display miniport driver can create private data for each allocation handle. The display miniport driver can subsequently call the <b>DxgkCbGetHandleData</b> function to retrieve private data for each graphics subsystem-specific handle. Therefore, the display miniport driver is not required to maintain a private allocation handle table. 

If the <b>DeviceSpecific</b> bit-field flag is set in the <b>Flags</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkargcb_gethandledata.md">DXGKARGCB_GETHANDLEDATA</a> structure that <i>pData</i> points to, <b>DxgkCbGetHandleData</b> returns the device-specific data that is associated with the device-specific handle that the driver returned from the call to its <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_openallocationinfo.md">DxgkDdiOpenAllocation</a> function. Note that the <b>DeviceSpecific</b> bit-field flag is valid only if the display miniport driver also sets the <b>Type</b> member of DXGKARGCB_GETHANDLEDATA to the DXGK_HANDLE_ALLOCATION enumeration value for the handle in the <b>hObject</b> member of DXGKARGCB_GETHANDLEDATA.


#### Examples

The following code example shows an implementation of <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_openallocationinfo.md">DxgkDdiOpenAllocation</a> in which <b>DxgkCbGetHandleData</b> is called.
