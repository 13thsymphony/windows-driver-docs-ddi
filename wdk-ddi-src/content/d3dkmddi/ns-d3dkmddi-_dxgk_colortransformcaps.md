# _DXGK_COLORTRANSFORMCAPS structure



## -description
This structure replaces the DXGK_GAMMARAMPCAPS structure in the DXGK_DRIVERCAPS structure to describe both the gamma and color transform capabilities of the display pipelines.


## -syntax

````
typedef struct _DXGK_COLORTRANSFORMCAPS  {
  union {
    struct {
      UINT Gamma_Rgb256x3x16  :1;
      UINT Gamma_Dxgi1  :1;
      UINT Transform_3x4Matrix  :1;
      UINT Transform_3x4Matrix_WideColor  :1;
      UINT Transform_3x4Matrix_HighColor  :1;
      UINT Reserved  :27;
    };
    UINT Value;
  };
} DXGK_COLORTRANSFORMCAPS , *PDXGK_COLORTRANSFORMCAPS ;

## -struct-fields

### -field Gamma_Rgb256x3x16

Indicates support for a GDI compatible gamma ramp.

### -field Gamma_Dxgi1

Indicates support for a DXGI1 gamma ramp.  These gamma ramps have been defined since WDDM 1.0 but were always required to be supported by any WDDM driver.
Full WDDM drivers are still required to support DXGI1 gamma so should set this flag but drivers for display-only and indirect display will be able to indicate support through this flag.


### -field Transform_3x4Matrix

Indicates support for a 3 by 4 matrix color transform in the display pipeline hardware.

### -field Transform_3x4Matrix_WideColor

Indicates support for a 3 by 4 matrix color transform in the display pipeline hardware when scanning out WideColor data.  Drivers which support this capability must also support Transform_3x4Matrix. The OS will NOT engage WideColorGamut mode unless both this bit and the WideColorSpace cap bits are set.

### -field Transform_3x4Matrix_HighColor

Indicates support for a 3 by 4 matrix color transform in the display pipeline hardware when scanning out HighColor data.  Drivers which support this capability must also support Transform_3x4Matrix_WideColor.

### -field Reserved

This value is reserved for system use.

### -field Value

The combined UINT value.
