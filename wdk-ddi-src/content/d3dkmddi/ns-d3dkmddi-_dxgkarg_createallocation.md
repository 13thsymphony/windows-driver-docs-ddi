# _DXGKARG_CREATEALLOCATION structure
The DXGKARG_CREATEALLOCATION structure describes how the display miniport driver should create allocations.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DXGKARG_CREATEALLOCATION {
  const VOID                 *pPrivateDriverData;
  UINT                       PrivateDriverDataSize;
  UINT                       NumAllocations;
  DXGK_ALLOCATIONINFO        *pAllocationInfo;
  HANDLE                     hResource;
  DXGK_CREATEALLOCATIONFLAGS Flags;
} DXGKARG_CREATEALLOCATION;
````

## Members


`Flags`

[in] A <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_createallocationflags.md">DXGK_CREATEALLOCATIONFLAGS</a> structure that identifies how to create allocations. Setting all of the bit-field flags to 0 indicates that allocations belong to the device and not to a particular resource.

`hResource`

[in/out] A handle to a resource. The display miniport driver can set this handle to a value that the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem can subsequently pass in driver calls and that refers to information for the allocations. If the resource was already created by a previous <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_createallocation.md">DxgkDdiCreateAllocation</a> call, this member contains the handle that the driver previously returned.

`NumAllocations`

[in] The number of elements in the array that <b>pAllocationInfo</b> specifies, which represents the number of allocations to create.

`pAllocationInfo`

[in/out] An array of <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_allocationinfo.md">DXGK_ALLOCATIONINFO</a> structures that describe the allocations to create.

`pPrivateDriverData`

[in] A pointer to a block of private data that is passed from the user-mode display driver to the display miniport driver. This member is typically used to provide data for a group of allocations. Note that this member is distinct from the <b>pPrivateDriverData</b> members of the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_allocationinfo.md">DXGK_ALLOCATIONINFO</a> structures in the array that <b>pAllocationInfo</b> specifies. You can set private data for this member in addition to private data for each allocation.

`PrivateDriverDataSize`

[in] The size, in bytes, of the private data that <b>pPrivateDriverData</b> points to.
