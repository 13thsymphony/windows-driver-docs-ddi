# DXGKDDI_DESTROYDEVICE callback function
The <i>DxgkDdiDestroyDevice</i> function destroys a graphics context device.

## Syntax

```
DXGKDDI_DESTROYDEVICE DxgkddiDestroydevice;

NTSTATUS DxgkddiDestroydevice(
  IN_CONST_HANDLE hDevice
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`hDevice`

[in] A handle to the graphics context device that <i>DxgkDdiDestroyDevice</i> will destroy. The display miniport driver's <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_createdevice.md">DxgkDdiCreateDevice</a> function previously provided this handle to the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem in the <b>hDevice</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_createdevice.md">DXGKARG_CREATEDEVICE</a> structure.


## Return Value

<i>DxgkDdiDestroyDevice</i> returns STATUS_SUCCESS, or an appropriate error result if the graphics context device is not successfully destroyed.

## Remarks

The DirectX graphics kernel subsystem calls the display miniport driver's <i>DxgkDdiDestroyDevice</i> function to destroy a graphics context device that the driver's <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_createdevice.md">DxgkDdiCreateDevice</a> function created. <i>DxgkDdiDestroyDevice</i> should free all of the resources that were allocated for the device and clean up any internal tracking data structures. 

<i>DxgkDdiDestroyDevice</i> should be made pageable.
