# DXGKDDI_VIDPNTOPOLOGY_ENUMPATHTARGETSFROMSOURCE callback



## -description
The <b>pfnEnumPathTargetsFromSource</b> function returns the identifier of one of the video present targets associated with a specified video present source.



## -prototype

````
DXGKDDI_VIDPNTOPOLOGY_ENUMPATHTARGETSFROMSOURCE pfnEnumPathTargetsFromSource;

NTSTATUS APIENTRY pfnEnumPathTargetsFromSource(
  _In_  const D3DKMDT_HVIDPNTOPOLOGY           hVidPnTopology,
  _In_  const D3DDDI_VIDEO_PRESENT_SOURCE_ID   VidPnSourceId,
  _In_  const D3DKMDT_VIDPN_PRESENT_PATH_INDEX VidPnPresentPathIndex,
  _Out_       D3DDDI_VIDEO_PRESENT_TARGET_ID   *pVidPnTargetId
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hVidPnTopology [in]

[in] A handle to a VidPN topology object. The display miniport driver previously obtained this handle by calling the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_vidpn_gettopology.md">pfnGetTopology</a> function of the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_vidpn_interface.md">DXGK_VIDPN_INTERFACE</a> interface.


### -param VidPnSourceId [in]

[in] An integer that identifies a particular video present source.


### -param VidPnPresentPathIndex [in]

[in] A zero-based index into the set of paths that contain the source identified by <i>VidPnSourceId</i>.


### -param pVidPnTargetId [out]

[out] A pointer to a variable that receives the target identifier.


## -returns
The <b>pfnEnumPathTargetsFromSource</b> function returns one of the following values:
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>The function succeeded.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_GRAPHICS_INVALID_VIDPN_TOPOLOGY</b></dt>
</dl>The handle supplied in <i>hVidPnTopology </i>was invalid.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</b></dt>
</dl>The pointer supplied in <i>pVidPnTargetId</i> was in valid.

 


## -remarks
<i>VidPnPresentPathIndex</i> is not an index into the set of all paths in the topology identified by <i>hVidPnTopology</i>. It is an index into a subset of all the paths in the topology: specifically, the subset of all paths that contain the source identified by <i>VidPnSourceId</i>.

To enumerate (in a given topology) all the targets associated with a particular source, perform the following steps.

Call <b>pfnGetNumPathsFromSource</b> to determine the number N of paths that contain the source of interest. Think of those paths as an indexed set with indices 0, 1, ... N - 1.

For each index 0 though N - 1, pass the source identifier and the index to <b>pfnEnumPathTargetsFromSource</b>.

A topology is a collection paths, each of which contains a (source, target) pair. It is possible for a particular source to appear in more than one path. For example, one source can be paired with two distinct targets in the case of a clone view.

VidPN source identifiers are assigned by the operating system. <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_start_device.md">DxgkDdiStartDevice</a>, implemented by the display miniport driver, returns the number N of video present sources supported by the display adapter. Then the operating system assigns identifiers 0, 1, 2, ... N - 1.

VidPN target identifiers are assigned by the display miniport driver. <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_query_child_relations.md">DxgkDdiQueryChildRelations</a>, implemented by the display miniport driver, returns an array of <a href="..\dispmprt\ns-dispmprt-_dxgk_child_descriptor.md">DXGK_CHILD_DESCRIPTOR</a> structures, each of which contains an identifier.

The D3DKMDT_HVIDPNTOPOLOGY and D3DKMDT_VIDPN_PRESENT_PATH_INDEX data types are defined in <i>D3dkmdt.h</i>.  

The D3DDDI_VIDEO_PRESENT_SOURCE_ID and D3DDDI_VIDEO_PRESENT_TARGET_ID data types are defined in <i>D3dukmdt.h</i>.
