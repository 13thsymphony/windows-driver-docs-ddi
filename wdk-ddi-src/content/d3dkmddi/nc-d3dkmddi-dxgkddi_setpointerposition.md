# DXGKDDI_SETPOINTERPOSITION function
The <i>DxgkDdiSetPointerPosition</i> function sets the location and visibility state of the mouse pointer.

## Syntax

```
DXGKDDI_SETPOINTERPOSITION DxgkddiSetpointerposition;

NTSTATUS DxgkddiSetpointerposition(
  IN_CONST_HANDLE hAdapter,
  IN_CONST_PDXGKARG_SETPOINTERPOSITION pSetPointerPosition
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`hAdapter`

[in] A handle to a context block that is associated with a display adapter. The display miniport driver previously provided this handle to the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem in the <i>MiniportDeviceContext</i> output parameter of the <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_add_device.md">DxgkDdiAddDevice</a> function.

`pSetPointerPosition`

[in] A pointer to a <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_setpointerposition.md">DXGKARG_SETPOINTERPOSITION</a> structure that describes where and how to display the mouse pointer.


## Return Value

<i>DxgkDdiSetPointerPosition</i> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if it succeeds; otherwise, it returns one of the error codes defined in <i>Ntstatus.h</i>.

## Remarks

The DirectX graphics kernel subsystem calls the display miniport driver's <i>DxgkDdiSetPointerPosition</i> function to set the location of the mouse pointer. The <i>DxgkDdiSetPointerPosition</i> function is called independently of all of the other display miniport driver functions. Therefore, a <i>DxgkDdiSetPointerPosition</i> thread can run simultaneously with another display miniport driver thread. However, the system ensures that <i>DxgkDdiSetPointerPosition</i> and <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_setpointershape.md">DxgkDdiSetPointerShape</a> threads cannot run simultaneously. 

If you run a <i>DxgkDdiSetPointerPosition</i> thread simultaneously with another display miniport driver thread, the display miniport driver should be able to program the mouse pointer hardware independently of other activities, such as operations that send a command buffer through direct memory access (DMA) to the graphics hardware, operations that program the graphics hardware by using memory-mapped I/O (MMIO), and so on.

<i>DxgkDdiSetPointerPosition</i> can be called even if the video present network (VidPN) topology that is associated with the <b>VidPnSourceId</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_setpointerposition.md">DXGKARG_SETPOINTERPOSITION</a> structure that the <i>pSetPointerPosition</i> parameter points to is disabled. In this case, the driver should return STATUS_SUCCESS but should make no changes to the state of the driver or hardware.

<i>DxgkDdiSetPointerPosition</i> should be made pageable.
