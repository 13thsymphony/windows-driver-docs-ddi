# _DXGK_POWER_COMPONENT_FLAGS structure



## -description
Describes state transition information about a power component.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _DXGK_POWER_COMPONENT_FLAGS {
  union {
    struct {
      UINT Reserved0  :1;
      UINT DriverCompletesFStateTransition  :1;
      UINT TransitionTo_F0_OnDx  :1;
      UINT Reserved  :29;
    };
    UINT Value;
  };
} DXGK_POWER_COMPONENT_FLAGS;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Reserved0

Reserved for system use and should be set to zero.


### -field DriverCompletesFStateTransition

If set, indicates that the display miniport driver will call the  <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkcb_completefstatetransition.md">DxgkCbCompleteFStateTransition</a> function for a registered power component when the component completes an F-state transition.

For more information, see Remarks section of the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkcb_completefstatetransition.md">DxgkCbCompleteFStateTransition</a> function.


### -field TransitionTo_F0_OnDx

If set, indicates that the Windows power management framework will place a registered power component into the F0 power state during device power state (Dx) transitions.

If set, during a Dx transition the power manager places the component into the F0 state before it dispatches a Dx IRP to the device stack. The power manager keeps the component in the F0 state until the D0 IRP is completed.


### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member to zero is equivalent to setting the remaining 29 bits (0xFFFFFFF8) of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member to zeros.


### -field Value

A member in the union that <b>DXGK_POWER_COMPONENT_FLAGS</b> contains that can hold a 32-bit value that identifies information about the power component.
