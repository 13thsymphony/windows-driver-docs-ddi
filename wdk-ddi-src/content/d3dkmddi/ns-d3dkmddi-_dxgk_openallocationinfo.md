# _DXGK_OPENALLOCATIONINFO structure
The DXGK_OPENALLOCATIONINFO structure contains handles to nondevice-specific and device-specific allocations that the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_openallocationinfo.md">DxgkDdiOpenAllocation</a> function associates.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DXGK_OPENALLOCATIONINFO {
  D3DKMT_HANDLE hAllocation;
  VOID          *pPrivateDriverData;
  UINT          PrivateDriverDataSize;
  HANDLE        hDeviceSpecificAllocation;
} DXGK_OPENALLOCATIONINFO;
````

## Members

        
            `hAllocation`

            [in] A D3DKMT_HANDLE data type that represents a kernel-mode handle to the nondevice-specific allocation that the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_createallocation.md">DxgkDdiCreateAllocation</a> function created. The Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem (which is part of <i>Dxgkrnl.sys</i>) assigned this handle for the allocation.
        
            `hDeviceSpecificAllocation`

            [out] A handle to the device-specific allocation that corresponds to the non device-specific allocation that <b>hAllocation</b> specifies. The display miniport driver must set <b>hDeviceSpecificAllocation</b> to a handle value that it can use to refer to its private tracking structure for the allocation.
        
            `pPrivateDriverData`

            [in/out] A pointer to a block of private data that is passed between the user-mode display driver and the display miniport driver. This block of private data is the same allocation-specific data that is passed in the <b>pPrivateDriverData</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_allocationinfo.md">DXGK_ALLOCATIONINFO</a> structure in the call to the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_createallocation.md">DxgkDdiCreateAllocation</a> function. The display miniport driver's <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_openallocationinfo.md">DxgkDdiOpenAllocation</a> function can modify this block of private data if the <b>Create</b> bit-field flag is set in the <b>Flags</b> member of the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_openallocation.md">DXGKARG_OPENALLOCATION</a> structure. The user-mode display driver can access modifications to the block of private data.
        
            `PrivateDriverDataSize`

            [in] The size, in bytes, of the block of private data that <b>pPrivateDriverData</b> points to.
