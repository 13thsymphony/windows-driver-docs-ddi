# _DXGKARG_DESTROYALLOCATION structure
The DXGKARG_DESTROYALLOCATION structure describes how the display miniport driver should release allocations.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DXGKARG_DESTROYALLOCATION {
  UINT                        NumAllocations;
  const HANDLE                *pAllocationList;
  HANDLE                      hResource;
  DXGK_DESTROYALLOCATIONFLAGS Flags;
} DXGKARG_DESTROYALLOCATION;
````

## Members


`Flags`

[in] A <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_destroyallocationflags.md">DXGK_DESTROYALLOCATIONFLAGS</a> structure that identifies how to release the allocations.

`hResource`

[in/out] A handle to a resource. The display miniport driver cleans up this handle if it must release the resource along with the allocations.

`NumAllocations`

[in] The number of elements in the array that <b>pAllocationList</b> specifies, which represents the number of allocations to release.

`pAllocationList`

[in] An array of handles to the allocations to release.

## Remarks
The handles in the array that the <b>pAllocationList</b> member specifies are handles to allocations that the driver's <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_createallocation.md">DxgkDdiCreateAllocation</a> function previously returned in the <b>hAllocation</b> members of <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_allocationinfo.md">DXGK_ALLOCATIONINFO</a> structures, which are part of the <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_createallocation.md">DXGKARG_CREATEALLOCATION</a> structure's <b>pAllocationInfo</b> member. Each allocation handle points to a buffer that contains private driver data for the allocation. The display miniport driver must release the memory for the allocations during the call to <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_destroyallocation.md">DxgkDdiDestroyAllocation</a>.

## Requirements

| **Windows version** | Available in Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating systems. Available in Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating systems. |
