# DXGKDDI_CREATEDEVICE function



## -description
The <i>DxgkDdiCreateDevice</i> function creates a graphics context device that is subsequently used in calls to the display miniport driver's device-specific functions.



## -syntax

````
DXGKDDI_CREATEDEVICE DxgkDdiCreateDevice;

NTSTATUS APIENTRY DxgkDdiCreateDevice(
  _In_    const HANDLE               hAdapter,
  _Inout_       DXGKARG_CREATEDEVICE *pCreateDevice
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hAdapter [in]

[in] A handle to a context block that is associated with a display adapter. The display miniport driver previously provided this handle to the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem in the <i>MiniportDeviceContext</i> output parameter of the <a href="..\dispmprt\nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_add_device.md">DxgkDdiAddDevice</a> function.


### -param pCreateDevice [in, out]

[in/out] A pointer to a <a href="..\d3dkmddi\ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_createdevice.md">DXGKARG_CREATEDEVICE</a> structure that describes the graphics context device.


## -returns
<i>DxgkDdiCreateDevice</i> returns one of the following values:
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl><i>DxgkDdiCreateDevice</i> successfully created the graphics context device.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_NO_MEMORY</b></dt>
</dl><i>DxgkDdiCreateDevice</i> could not allocate memory that was required for it to complete.

 


## -remarks
The DirectX graphics kernel subsystem calls the display miniport driver's <i>DxgkDdiCreateDevice</i> function to create a graphics context device that the graphics subsystem subsequently passes in calls to the display miniport driver. The driver uses a device to hold a collection of rendering state. The graphics subsystem can create multiple devices in the same process on a given graphics processing unit (GPU) adapter. 

Generally, devices are independent of each other; in other words, resources that are created in one device cannot be referenced or accessed by resources that are created in another device. However, cross-process resources are an exception to this rule. 

<i>DxgkDdiCreateDevice</i> should be made pageable.
