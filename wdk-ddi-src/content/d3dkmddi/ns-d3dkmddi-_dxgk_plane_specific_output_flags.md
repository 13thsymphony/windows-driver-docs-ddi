# _DXGK_PLANE_SPECIFIC_OUTPUT_FLAGS structure



## -description
A structure containing the flags that apply to a plane set by the driver. 



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _DXGK_PLANE_SPECIFIC_OUTPUT_FLAGS {
  union {
    struct {
      UINT FlipConvertedToImmediate  :1;
      UINT  PostPresentNeeded  :1;
      UINT HsyncInterruptCompletion  :1;
      UINT Reserved  :29;
    };
    UINT Value;
  };
} DXGK_PLANE_SPECIFIC_OUTPUT_FLAGS;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field FlipConvertedToImmediate

Indicates that the flip was converted to an immediate flip rather than a VSYNC flip. The driver sets FlipConvertedToImmediate when the current line is less than DXGK_MULTIPLANE_OVERLAY_PLANE3.MaxImmediateFlipLine.


### -field  PostPresentNeeded

  Indicates that scheduler must call DXGDDI_POSTMULTIPLANEOVERLAYPRESENT for this specific plane. The driver must only set this flag for immediate flips.


### -field HsyncInterruptCompletion

Indicates that the scheduler should not assume that the immediate flip for this plane is completed upon the return from DdiSetVidPnSourceAddressWithMultiPlaneOverlay3 DDI. . Instead, the OS will only assume the immediate flip is completed when it receives a CrtcVsyncWithMultiPlaneOverlay2 interrupt notification with the PresentId greater or equal to pending immediate flip request. CrtcVsyncWithMultiPlaneOverlay2 interrupt notification for this flip may be an HsyncFlipCompletion, or it may be a regular VSync notification. The driver must only set this flag for immediate flips.  


### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member to zero is equivalent to setting the remaining 27 bits (0xFFFFFFE0) of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member to zeros.


### -field Value
