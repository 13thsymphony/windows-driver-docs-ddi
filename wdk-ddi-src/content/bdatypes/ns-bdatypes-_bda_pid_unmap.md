# _BDA_PID_UNMAP structure
The BDA_PID_UNMAP structure describes packet types to stop filtering from the input stream of a packet identifier (PID) filter. These packet types are identified with PIDs.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _BDA_PID_UNMAP {
  ULONG ulcPIDs;
  ULONG aulPIDs[MIN_DIMENSION];
} BDA_PID_UNMAP, *PBDA_PID_UNMAP;
````

## Members


`aulPIDs`

Array of PIDs that identify packets to unmap from the output of a PID filter.

`ulcPIDs`

Number of PIDs in the <b>aulPIDs</b> array.
