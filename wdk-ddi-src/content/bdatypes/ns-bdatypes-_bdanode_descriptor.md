# _BDANODE_DESCRIPTOR structure
The BDANODE_DESCRIPTOR structure describes a BDA node.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _BDANODE_DESCRIPTOR {
  ULONG ulBdaNodeType;
  GUID  guidFunction;
  GUID  guidName;
} BDANODE_DESCRIPTOR, *PBDANODE_DESCRIPTOR;
````

## Members


`guidFunction`

GUID that describes the node's function. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556529">BDA Node Category GUIDs</a> for a list of these GUIDs.

`guidName`

GUID that can be used to store a string containing the name of the node. Applications can search the registry for this GUID to obtain the node's name and then can display the name.

`ulBdaNodeType`

The node type as the BDA template topology identifies it. The BDA node-type identifier typically corresponds to the index of the element in the zero-based array of node types. This array of node types is an array of KSNODE_DESCRIPTOR structures.
