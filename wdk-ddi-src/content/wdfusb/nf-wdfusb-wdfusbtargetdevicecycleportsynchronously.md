# WdfUsbTargetDeviceCyclePortSynchronously function
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF only]

The <b>WdfUsbTargetDeviceCyclePortSynchronously</b> method power-cycles the USB port to which a specified device is attached.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS WdfUsbTargetDeviceCyclePortSynchronously(
  _In_ WDFUSBDEVICE UsbDevice
);
````

## Parameters

`UsbDevice`

A handle to a USB device object that was obtained from a previous call to <a href="..\wdfusb\nf-wdfusb-wdfusbtargetdevicecreatewithparameters.md">WdfUsbTargetDeviceCreateWithParameters</a>.


## Return Value

<b>WdfUsbTargetDeviceCyclePortSynchronously</b> returns the I/O target's completion status value if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this method might return one of the following values:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_REQUEST</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The caller's IRQL was invalid.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

This method also might return other <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557697">NTSTATUS values</a>.

A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.

## Remarks

Power-cycling a port causes the device to be surprise-removed and re-enumerated. A driver might request a power cycle after it has loaded firmware into a device.

Before the framework cycles the I/O target's USB port, it cancels all I/O requests that remain in the I/O target's queue. The driver must not send additional I/O requests to the I/O target until <b>WdfUsbTargetDeviceCyclePortSynchronously</b> returns.

The driver must call <a href="..\wdfiotarget\nf-wdfiotarget-wdfiotargetstop.md">WdfIoTargetStop</a> before it calls <b>WdfUsbTargetDeviceCyclePortSynchronously</b>.

For more information about the <b>WdfUsbTargetDeviceCyclePortSynchronously</b> method and USB I/O targets, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/195c0f4b-7f33-428a-8de7-32643ad854c6">USB I/O Targets</a>.


#### Examples

The following code example power-cycles a specified device's USB port.

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>NTSTATUS status;

status = WdfUsbTargetDeviceCyclePortSynchronously(UsbDevice);</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
