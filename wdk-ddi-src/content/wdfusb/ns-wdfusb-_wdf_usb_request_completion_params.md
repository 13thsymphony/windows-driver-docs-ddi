## -struct-fields

### -field UsbdStatus

The <a href="buses.usbd_status">USBD_STATUS</a>-typed status value that the I/O target returned.

### -field Type

A <a href="wdf.wdf_usb_request_type">WDF_USB_REQUEST_TYPE</a>-typed values that identifies the request type.

### -field Parameters


### -field DeviceString


### -field Buffer

If the driver has called <a href="wdf.wdfusbtargetdeviceformatrequestforstring">WdfUsbTargetDeviceFormatRequestForString</a>, this member contains the driver-supplied handle to the memory object that receives the Unicode string.

### -field LangID

If the driver has called <a href="wdf.wdfusbtargetdeviceformatrequestforstring">WdfUsbTargetDeviceFormatRequestForString</a>, this member contains the driver-supplied language identifier.

### -field StringIndex

If the driver has called <a href="wdf.wdfusbtargetdeviceformatrequestforstring">WdfUsbTargetDeviceFormatRequestForString</a>, this member contains the driver-supplied string index.

### -field RequiredSize

If the driver has called any method that <a href="wdf.working_with_usb_devices#obtaining_a_device_s_unicode_strings#obtaining_a_device_s_unicode_strings">obtains a device's Unicode strings</a> (except <a href="wdf.wdfusbtargetdeviceformatrequestforurb">WdfUsbTargetDeviceFormatRequestForUrb</a>), this member contains the required size of the buffer that <b>Parameters.DeviceString.Buffer</b> specifies. 
If the driver called <a href="wdf.wdfusbtargetdeviceformatrequestforurb">WdfUsbTargetDeviceFormatRequestForUrb</a>, it can obtain the required size value from the URB whose handle is in <b>Parameters.DeviceUrb.Buffer</b>.
</dd>
</dl>

### -field DeviceControlTransfer


### -field Buffer

If the driver has called <a href="wdf.wdfusbtargetdeviceformatrequestforcontroltransfer">WdfUsbTargetDeviceFormatRequestForControlTransfer</a>, this member contains the driver-supplied handle to the memory object that receives input or output data.

### -field SetupPacket

If the driver has called <a href="wdf.wdfusbtargetdeviceformatrequestforcontroltransfer">WdfUsbTargetDeviceFormatRequestForControlTransfer</a>, this member contains the address of the <a href="wdf.wdf_usb_control_setup_packet">WDF_USB_CONTROL_SETUP_PACKET</a> structure that the driver supplied.

### -field Length

If the driver has called any method that <a href="wdf.working_with_usb_devices#sending_a_control_transfer#sending_a_control_transfer">sends a control transfer</a> (except <a href="wdf.wdfusbtargetdeviceformatrequestforurb">WdfUsbTargetDeviceFormatRequestForUrb</a>), this member contains the number of bytes that were sent or received. 
If the driver called <a href="wdf.wdfusbtargetdeviceformatrequestforurb">WdfUsbTargetDeviceFormatRequestForUrb</a>, it can obtain the length value from the URB whose handle is in <b>Parameters.DeviceUrb.Buffer</b>.
</dd>
</dl>

### -field DeviceUrb


### -field Buffer

If the driver has called <a href="wdf.wdfusbtargetdeviceformatrequestforurb">WdfUsbTargetDeviceFormatRequestForUrb</a>, this member contains the driver-supplied handle to the memory object that contains a <a href="buses.urb">URB</a> structure.
</dd>
</dl>

### -field PipeWrite


### -field Buffer

If the driver has called <a href="wdf.wdfusbtargetpipeformatrequestforwrite">WdfUsbTargetPipeFormatRequestForWrite</a>, this member contains the driver-supplied handle to the memory object that was written to the pipe.

### -field Length

If the driver has called any method <a href="wdf.working_with_usb_pipes#writing_to_a_pipe#writing_to_a_pipe">that writes to a pipe</a> (except <a href="wdf.wdfusbtargetdeviceformatrequestforurb">WdfUsbTargetDeviceFormatRequestForUrb</a>), this member contains the number of bytes that were sent. 
If the driver called <a href="wdf.wdfusbtargetdeviceformatrequestforurb">WdfUsbTargetDeviceFormatRequestForUrb</a>, it can obtain the length value from the URB whose handle is in <b>Parameters.PipeUrb.Buffer</b>.

### -field Offset

If the driver has called <a href="wdf.wdfusbtargetpipeformatrequestforwrite">WdfUsbTargetPipeFormatRequestForWrite</a>, this member contains the driver-supplied buffer offset. 
</dd>
</dl>

### -field PipeRead


### -field Buffer

If the driver has called <a href="wdf.wdfusbtargetpipeformatrequestforread">WdfUsbTargetPipeFormatRequestForRead</a>, this member contains the driver-supplied handle to the memory object that contains data that was read from the pipe.

### -field Length

If the driver has called any method that <a href="wdf.working_with_usb_pipes#reading_from_a_pipe#reading_from_a_pipe">reads from a pipe</a> sends a control transfer (except <a href="wdf.wdfusbtargetdeviceformatrequestforurb">WdfUsbTargetDeviceFormatRequestForUrb</a>), this member contains the number of bytes that were received. 
If the driver called <a href="wdf.wdfusbtargetdeviceformatrequestforurb">WdfUsbTargetDeviceFormatRequestForUrb</a>, it can obtain the length value from the URB whose handle is in <b>Parameters.PipeUrb.Buffer</b>.

### -field Offset

If the driver has called <a href="wdf.wdfusbtargetpipeformatrequestforread">WdfUsbTargetPipeFormatRequestForRead</a>, this member contains the driver-supplied buffer offset. 
</dd>
</dl>

### -field PipeUrb


### -field Buffer

If the driver has called <a href="wdf.wdfusbtargetpipeformatrequestforurb">WdfUsbTargetPipeFormatRequestForUrb</a>, this member contains the driver-supplied handle to the memory object that contains a <a href="buses.urb">URB</a> structure.
