# PFNKSPINVOID callback function
An AVStream minidriver's callback routine is called when:
<ul>
<li>The relevant <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_kspin.md">KSPIN</a> is serving as a sink pin and this sink pin is disconnected from an AVStream source pin.</li>
<li>A <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_kspin.md">KSPIN</a> structure's reset state is changed due to the arrival of an IOCTL_KS_RESET_STATE device control. This routine is also called when the queue associated with the given pin is flushed. </li>
</ul>

## Syntax

```
PFNKSPINVOID Pfnkspinvoid;

void Pfnkspinvoid(
  PKSPIN Pin
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Pin`

Pointer to the relevant <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_kspin.md">KSPIN</a>, serving as a sink pin.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

<b>About AVStrMiniPinDisconnect</b>

The minidriver specifies this routine's address in the <b>Disconnect</b> member of its <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_kspin_dispatch.md">KSPIN_DISPATCH</a> structure.

This routine is optional.

Also see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/04d0d17b-c326-417d-b2e8-58b33420455a">KS Pins</a>.

<b>About AVStrMiniPinReset</b>

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/0b6a02c2-e672-4568-a890-491c721ec3a7">Pin-Centric Processing</a>.

The minidriver specifies this routine's address in the <b>Reset</b> member of its <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_kspin_dispatch.md">KSPIN_DISPATCH</a> structure.

Typically, this routine is provided by minidrivers that must flush hardware buffers. The filter control mutex may be held during this function. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/402795a0-e567-4e7e-a7d8-b2ce29ffb8fd">Filter Control Mutex in AVStream</a>.

This routine is optional.
