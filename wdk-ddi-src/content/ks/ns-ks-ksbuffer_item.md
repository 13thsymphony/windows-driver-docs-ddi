# KSBUFFER_ITEM structure
The KSBUFFER_ITEM structure is used to store a list of data buffers copied from the event source, which can be retrieved by the event sink through KSEVENT_TYPE_QUERYBUFFER.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct {
  KSDPC_ITEM DpcItem;
  LIST_ENTRY BufferList;
} KSBUFFER_ITEM, *PKSBUFFER_ITEM;
````

## Members


`BufferList`

Specifies the head of a list of pool allocated buffers that are created by calls to <a href="..\ks\nf-ks-ksgeneratedataevent.md">KsGenerateDataEvent</a> for events that have buffering enabled.

`DpcItem`

A structure of type <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-ksdpc_item.md">KSDPC_ITEM</a>. May be used by internal DPCs; do not use for data buffering.

## Remarks
KSBUFFER_ITEM extends the normal deferred procedure call (DPC) structure, which may be needed for event generation, but does not use the structure itself.

## Requirements
