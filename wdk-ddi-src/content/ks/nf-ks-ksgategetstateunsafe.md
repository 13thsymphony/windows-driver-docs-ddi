# KsGateGetStateUnsafe function



## -description
<p>The<b> KsGateGetStateUnsafe</b> function returns the state of the given gate (open or closed)  in an unsafe manner, that is <i>without regard to synchronization</i>.</p>


## -syntax

````
BOOLEAN __inline KsGateGetStateUnsafe(
  _In_Â PKSGATE Gate
);
````


## -parameters
<dl>

### -param <i>Gate</i> [in]

<dd>
<p>A pointer to a <a href="..\ks\ns-ks--ksgate.md">KSGATE</a> structure representing the gate for which to return the state.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

## -returns
<p>This call returns <b>TRUE</b> if the gate is open and <b>FALSE</b> if the gate is closed.</p>

## -remarks
<p>Because <b>KsGateGetStateUnsafe</b> does not handle synchronization, it is possible to get a result that is not consistent with the state of the gate if the gate is in mid-transition from one state to another at the time of the call.</p>

<p>Consider a situation in which the output of gate A is connected as an input to gate B. A transitions to closed, causing B to transition from open to closed. If, at the same time, another thread calls <b>KsGateGetStateUnsafe</b> between the time A closes and the time B closes, the routine still returns that B was open.</p>

<p><b>KsGateGetStateUnsafe</b> returns whether <i>Gate-&gt;Count</i> is greater than zero. The function does not use any interlocked functions to do this. Thus, the call is performed without regard to synchronization.</p>
