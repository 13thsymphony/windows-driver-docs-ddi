# KSCOMPONENTID structure
The KSCOMPONENTID structure contains unique identifiers that describe an individual kernel streaming object.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct {
  GUID  Manufacturer;
  GUID  Product;
  GUID  Component;
  GUID  Name;
  ULONG Version;
  ULONG Revision;
} KSCOMPONENTID, *PKSCOMPONENTID;
````

## Members


`Manufacturer`

Specifies the unique identifier for the manufacturer of the component. This is generated by the manufacturer, and may be resolved to a localized string representation through a registry entry.

`Product`

Specifies the unique identifier for the product to which the component belongs. This is generated by the manufacturer, and may be resolved to a localized string representation through a registry entry.

`Component`

Specifies the unique identifier for the component. This is generated by the manufacturer, and may be resolved to a localized string representation through a registry entry.

`Name`

Optionally specifies the unique identifier for the name, which may be different than the Component entry, or this may be GUID_NULL. This is generated by the manufacturer, and may be resolved to a localized string representation through a registry entry.

`Version`

Specifies the version number for the component or product.

`Revision`

Specifies the revision number for the component or product.

## Remarks
Supply this structure in a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565171">KSPROPERTY_GENERAL_COMPONENTID</a> request.
