## -description
An AVStream minidriver's <i>AVStrMiniDevicePostStart</i> routine is called when AVStream performs post-PnP-start processing. Use it to load drivers at start time, for example. Such events then will occur in the context of a worker thread after PnP start.



## -prototype

````
PFNKSDEVICE AVStrMiniDevicePostStart;

NTSTATUS AVStrMiniDevicePostStart(
  _In_ PKSDEVICE Device
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param Device [in]

Pointer to a <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_ksdevice.md">KSDEVICE</a> structure describing the device for which the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551749">IRP_MN_START_DEVICE</a> request was sent.


## -returns
Should return STATUS_SUCCESS or the error code that was returned from the attempt to perform the operation. If this routine returns failure, any pending <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548630">IRP_MJ_CREATE</a> requests between the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551749">IRP_MN_START_DEVICE</a> request and the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551755">IRP_MN_STOP_DEVICE</a> request will be failed. Do not return STATUS_PENDING.


## -remarks
The minidriver specifies this routine's address in the <b>PostStart</b> member of its <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_ksdevice_dispatch.md">KSDEVICE_DISPATCH</a> structure.
