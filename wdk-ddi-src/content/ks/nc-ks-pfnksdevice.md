# PFNKSDEVICE callback function
An AVStream minidriver's <i>AVStrMiniDevicePostStart</i> routine is called when AVStream performs post-PnP-start processing. Use it to load drivers at start time, for example. Such events then will occur in the context of a worker thread after PnP start.

## Syntax

```
PFNKSDEVICE Pfnksdevice;

NTSTATUS Pfnksdevice(
  PKSDEVICE Device
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Device`

Pointer to a <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_ksdevice.md">KSDEVICE</a> structure describing the device for which the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551749">IRP_MN_START_DEVICE</a> request was sent.


## Return Value

Should return STATUS_SUCCESS or the error code that was returned from the attempt to perform the operation. If this routine returns failure, any pending <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548630">IRP_MJ_CREATE</a> requests between the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551749">IRP_MN_START_DEVICE</a> request and the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551755">IRP_MN_STOP_DEVICE</a> request will be failed. Do not return STATUS_PENDING.

## Remarks

The minidriver specifies this routine's address in the <b>PostStart</b> member of its <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_ksdevice_dispatch.md">KSDEVICE_DISPATCH</a> structure.

This routine is optional.
