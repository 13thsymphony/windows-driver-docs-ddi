# PFNKSINTERSECTHANDLER callback function
A streaming minidriver's <i>KStrIntersectHandler</i> routine is called to compare a data range to determine if there is an intersection, and if so, the data format of the intersection.

## Syntax

```
PFNKSINTERSECTHANDLER Pfnksintersecthandler;

NTSTATUS Pfnksintersecthandler(
  PIRP Irp,
  PKSP_PIN Pin,
  PKSDATARANGE DataRange,
  PVOID Data
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Irp`

Specifies the IRP that handles the property request.

`Pin`

Specifies the specific property being queried and the pin factory identifier that was validated.

`DataRange`

Specifies the current data range to compare. The data range has been validated as either matching a particular range on the pin or as a wildcard match.

`Data`

Specifies the data format returned, or the size, in bytes, of the data format.


## Return Value

Returns STATUS_SUCCESS if there is a data intersection that fits in the supplied buffer. Otherwise, one of the following values is returned. 
<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>

<tr>
<td width="40%">
