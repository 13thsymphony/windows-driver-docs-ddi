# KSTOPOLOGY structure
The KSTOPOLOGY structure describes the topology of pins and nodes.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct {
  ULONG                       CategoriesCount;
  const GUID                  *Categories;
  ULONG                       TopologyNodesCount;
  const GUID                  *TopologyNodes;
  ULONG                       TopologyConnectionsCount;
  const KSTOPOLOGY_CONNECTION *TopologyConnections;
  const GUID                  *TopologyNodesNames;
  ULONG                       Reserved;
} KSTOPOLOGY, *PKSTOPOLOGY;
````

## Members


`Categories`

Points to the beginning of the array of functional categories that the driver supports.

`CategoriesCount`

Specifies the number of functional categories that the driver supports.

`Reserved`

Reserved for system use. Drivers should set this to zero.

`TopologyConnections`

Points to the beginning of the array of topology connections for this structure.

`TopologyConnectionsCount`

Specifies the number of entries in the array pointed to by <b>TopologyConnections</b>. The node numbers of each entry must correspond to the array offset of the node within <b>TopologyNodes</b>. When this structure is a part of a streaming minidriver's <a href="..\strmini\ns-strmini-_hw_stream_header.md">HW_STREAM_HEADER</a>, the pin numbers must correspond to the offsets within the array of <a href="..\strmini\ns-strmini-_hw_stream_information.md">HW_STREAM_INFORMATION</a> structures in the minidriver's <a href="..\strmini\ns-strmini-_hw_stream_descriptor.md">HW_STREAM_DESCRIPTOR</a> structure.

`TopologyNodes`

Points to the beginning of the array of GUIDs that describe the type of each node. For a list of video kernel streaming related nodes, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560886">Kernel Streaming Topology Nodes</a>. For a list of audio kernel streaming related nodes, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536219">Audio Topology Nodes</a>.

`TopologyNodesCount`

Specifies the number of nodes that the driver supports.

`TopologyNodesNames`

Specifies the GUID of the localized Unicode string name for the node, stored in the registry.

## Remarks
A stream class minidriver creates and passes this structure as part of its <a href="..\strmini\ns-strmini-_hw_stream_header.md">HW_STREAM_HEADER</a> structure. The class driver uses this structure to process topology property requests. The property data that the class driver returns is determined from the KSTOPOLOGY structure as follows:
