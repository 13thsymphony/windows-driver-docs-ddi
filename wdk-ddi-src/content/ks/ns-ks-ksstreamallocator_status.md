# KSSTREAMALLOCATOR_STATUS structure
The KSSTREAMALLOCATOR_STATUS structure describes framing requirements and current number of allocated frames for a specific allocator.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct {
  KSALLOCATOR_FRAMING Framing;
  ULONG               AllocatedFrames;
  ULONG               Reserved;
} KSSTREAMALLOCATOR_STATUS, *PKSSTREAMALLOCATOR_STATUS;
````

## Members


`AllocatedFrames`

Contains the current number of allocated frames. This value changes on an extremely frequent basis.

`Framing`

A <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-ksallocator_framing.md">KSALLOCATOR_FRAMING</a> structure that contains the framing specified when the allocator was created.

`Reserved`

Reserved and set to zero.

## Remarks
Clients can query allocator status by providing a KSSTREAMALLOCATOR_STATUS structure in a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565670">KSPROPERTY_STREAMALLOCATOR_STATUS</a> property request.
