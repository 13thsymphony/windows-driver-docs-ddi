# PFNKSSTREAMPOINTER callback function
AVStream calls a minidriver's <i>AVStrMiniCancelCallback</i> routine when the IRP that is associated with a cloned stream pointer is canceled. This routine is optional.

## Syntax

```
PFNKSSTREAMPOINTER Pfnksstreampointer;

void Pfnksstreampointer(
  PKSSTREAM_POINTER StreamPointer
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`StreamPointer`

A pointer to the clone <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_ksstream_pointer.md">KSSTREAM_POINTER</a> that is associated with the IRP that was canceled. <i>StreamPointer</i> was created by a call to <a href="..\ks\nf-ks-ksstreampointerclone.md">KsStreamPointerClone</a>.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

The minidriver specifies this routine's address in the <i>CancelCallback</i> parameter of <a href="..\ks\nf-ks-ksstreampointerclone.md">KsStreamPointerClone</a>.

In <i>AVStrMiniCancelCallback</i>, the minidriver should set all references to the clone pointer to <b>NULL</b>.

In addition, the minidriver should remove any context information that is related to the clone pointer, and notify hardware about the cancellation.

Finally, the minidriver must call <a href="..\ks\nf-ks-ksstreampointerdelete.md">KsStreamPointerDelete</a> to delete the clone and the context associated with it. If the minidriver does not delete the clone, the IRP will retain a reference count and not complete, possibly causing related applications to crash.

<i>AVStrMiniCancelCallback</i> is called with the queue's spin lock held, hence at DISPATCH_LEVEL. Accordingly, the callback routine cannot perform queue manipulation or call functions that acquire a mutex.
