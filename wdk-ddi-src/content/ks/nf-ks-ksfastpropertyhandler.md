# KsFastPropertyHandler function
The <b>KsFastPropertyHandler</b> function handles fast property requests through IOCTL_KS_PROPERTY. It responds to all property identifiers defined by the sets that are also contained in the fast I/O list. This function can only be called at PASSIVE_LEVEL.

## Syntax

````
KSDDKAPI BOOLEAN NTAPI KsFastPropertyHandler(void);
````

## Parameters

`FileObject`

TBD

`Property`

TBD

`PropertyLength`

TBD

`Data`

TBD

`DataLength`

TBD

`IoStatus`

TBD

`PropertySetsCount`

TBD

`PropertySet`

TBD


## Return Value

The <b>KsFastPropertyHandler</b> function returns <b>TRUE</b> if the request was handled, or <b>FALSE</b> if the request was not handled. If <b>FALSE</b> is returned, an IRP is generated. If the request was handled, the function sets the IoStatus-&gt;Information element, either through setting it to zero because of an internal error, or through a property handler setting it. The property handler also sets the IoStatus-&gt;Status field when the property is actually handled.

## Remarks

The owner of a property set can perform prefiltering or postfiltering of the property handling, as well as processing requests made through the fast I/O dispatch interface for device control. The <b>KsFastPropertyHandler</b> function is only used to process requests that can be fulfilled quickly.  The <i>Wait</i> parameter of the fast I/O function is not passed and is assumed to be <b>TRUE</b>.
