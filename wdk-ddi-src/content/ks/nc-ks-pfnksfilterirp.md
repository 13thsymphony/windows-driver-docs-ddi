# PFNKSFILTERIRP callback



## -description
An AVStream minidriver's <i>AVStrMiniFilterCreate</i> routine is called when a filter receives an IRP. 


<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548630">IRP_MJ_CREATE</a>



<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550720">IRP_MJ_CLOSE</a>




## -prototype

````
PFNKSFILTERIRP MyAVStrMiniFilterIRPHandler;

NTSTATUS MyAVStrMiniFilterIRPHandler(
  _In_ PKSFILTER Filter,
  _In_ PIRP      Irp
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param Filter [in]

Pointer to the <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_ksfilter.md">KSFILTER</a>.


### -param Irp [in]

Pointer to the IRP for <i>Filter</i>.


## -returns
If the routine succeeds, return STATUS_SUCCESS or the error code.


## -remarks
Typically, this routine is used by minidrivers that want to initialize the context and resources associated with the filter.

The minidriver specifies this routine's address in the <b>Create</b> member of its <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_ksfilter_dispatch.md">KSFILTER_DISPATCH</a> structure.

At the point at which the routine is called, the file object has an associated context, and the KS object header has been allocated.

This routine is called at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL with the device mutex held.

This routine is optional.

The minidriver specifies this routine's address in the <b>Close</b> member of its <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_ksfilter_dispatch.md">KSFILTER_DISPATCH</a> structure.

At the point at which the routine is called, any registered events on the filter have been freed, but the object is otherwise intact.

This routine is called at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL with the device mutex held. For more information about mutexes, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/011edaaa-7449-41c3-8cfb-0d319901af8b">Mutexes in AVStream</a>.

Return STATUS_SUCCESS or STATUS_PENDING. If a minidriver returns STATUS_PENDING, AVStream will not complete the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550720">IRP_MJ_CLOSE</a> immediately. Before returning STATUS_PENDING, however, the minidriver must call <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iomarkirppending.md">IoMarkIrpPending</a>. Once the processing of the close is complete, the minidriver must set the IRP's status code and then call <a href="..\ks\nf-ks-kscompletependingrequest.md">KsCompletePendingRequest</a>.
