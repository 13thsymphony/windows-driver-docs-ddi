# KsStreamPointerDelete function
The<b> KsStreamPointerDelete </b>function deletes a clone stream pointer, releasing a reference on the frame to which this stream pointer referred.

## Syntax

````
void KsStreamPointerDelete(
  _In_ PKSSTREAM_POINTER StreamPointer
);
````

## Parameters

`StreamPointer`

A pointer to a <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_ksstream_pointer.md">KSSTREAM_POINTER</a> structure representing the clone stream pointer to delete. Must be a clone stream pointer; cannot be the leading or trailing edge stream pointer.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

If the frame to which <i>StreamPointer</i> points has no other references on it after deletion, it is completed. When the last frame in a given IRP is completed, the IRP is completed.

The leading edge and trailing edge stream pointers for a given queue and pin are special stream pointers that cannot be deleted.
