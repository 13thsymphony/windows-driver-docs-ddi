# KSDPC_ITEM structure
The KSDPC_ITEM structure is used to store information related to any internal DPCs that might be used to generate event notification from a raised IRQL.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct {
  KDPC       Dpc;
  ULONG      ReferenceCount;
  KSPIN_LOCK AccessLock;
} KSDPC_ITEM, *PKSDPC_ITEM;
````

## Members


`AccessLock`

This lock is used to synchronize deletion of an event item with any DPC that might be running.

`Dpc`

Specifies a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551882">KDPC</a> structure that is queued to perform notifications that cannot occur at raised IRQL.

`ReferenceCount`

Specifies whether pending DPCs will reference this structure. This is initially set to 1 when the event structure is created, and decremented when the event structure is destroyed. If the reference count is nonzero at that time, then the last DPC to run frees the structure rather than the event disable call.

## Remarks
KSDPC_ITEM uses a reference counting scheme to determine when to free the structure.
