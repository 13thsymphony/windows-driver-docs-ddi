# IKsReferenceClock interface



## -description
The <b>IKsReferenceClock</b> interface is a COM-style interface that is provided by AVStream on all pins. The pin passes the request onto the master clock.



## -syntax

````
    PIKSREFERENCECLOCK RefClock;

    if (NT_SUCCESS (
      KsPinGetReferenceClockInterface (
        Pin,
        &RefClock)
) {
        ... RefClock -> GetCorrelatedTime (...);
        RefClock -> Release ();
    }

## -inheritance
The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IKsReferenceClock</b> interface inherits from the <a href="com.iunknown" xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n"><b>IUnknown</b></a> interface. <b>IKsReferenceClock</b> also has these types of members:

The <b>IKsReferenceClock</b> interface has these methods.

Queries the associated reference clock for the current correlated physical time and system time.

Concurrently queries the associated reference clock for current stream time and acquires the system time. Use if obtaining a time stamp for the <b>PresentationTime</b> member of <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-ksstream_header.md">KSSTREAM_HEADER</a>.

Queries the associated reference clock for the current physical time.

Queries the associated reference clock for its resolution.

Queries the associated reference clock for its current state.

Queries the associated reference clock for the current time.

## -remarks
The minidriver can acquire an <b>IKsReferenceClock</b> interface by calling <a href="..\ks\nf-ks-kspingetreferenceclockinterface.md">KsPinGetReferenceClockInterface</a>. Because this is a COM-style interface, <b>KsPinGetReferenceClockInterface</b> calls <b>QueryInterface</b>, which in turn invokes <b>AddRef</b> to increment the interface pointer. This means that when the minidriver is finished with the <b>IKsReferenceClock</b> interface, the minidriver must release it by calling <b>Release</b>.

Clients that are written in C will see the <b>IKsReferenceClock</b> interface as a structure that contains a pointer to a table of functions instead of a C++ abstract base class. A client that is written in C++ might do the following:

However, a client that is written in C would do the following instead :
