# KSNODE_CREATE structure
The KSNODE_CREATE structure describes the set of information used to create the node handle.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct {
  ULONG CreateFlags;
  ULONG Node;
} KSNODE_CREATE, *PKSNODE_CREATE;
````

## Members


`CreateFlags`

Set to zero.

`Node`

Indicates what node a handle should be created for. This refers to the node identifiers returned when querying topology information. A node identifier of −1 may be used to refer to the collection of nodes as a whole, if the filter supports it.


## Requirements
