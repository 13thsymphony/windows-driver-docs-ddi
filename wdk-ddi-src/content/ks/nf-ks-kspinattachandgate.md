# KsPinAttachAndGate function
The<b> KsPinAttachAndGate</b> function connects <i>Pin</i> as an input to a previously initialized AND gate, and connects <i>AndGate</i> as an input to the relevant filter's AND gate.

## Syntax

````
void KsPinAttachAndGate(
  _In_     PKSPIN  Pin,
  _In_opt_ PKSGATE AndGate
);
````

## Parameters

`Pin`

A pointer to the <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_kspin.md">KSPIN</a> structure to use an input to the AND gate.

`AndGate`

A pointer to a <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_ksgate.md">KSGATE</a> structure that is the previously initialized AND gate to connect to the relevant filter's AND gate. If this optional parameter is <b>NULL</b>, any <b>KSGATE</b> currently attached to the pin is detached.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

To insert the gate, first call <a href="..\ks\nf-ks-ksgateinitializeand.md">KsGateInitializeAnd</a>. Then call <b>KsPinAttachAndGate</b>. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c5592f92-a432-44e3-afe0-60fcf917a443">Flow Control Gates in AVStream</a>.

<b>KsPinAttachAndGate </b>must be called at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL before the pin in question leaves KSSTATE_STOP.
