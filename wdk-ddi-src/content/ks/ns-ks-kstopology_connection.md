# KSTOPOLOGY_CONNECTION structure



## -description
The KSTOPOLOGY_CONNECTION structure describes a single data-path connection inside a kernel streaming filter.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct {
  ULONG FromNode;
  ULONG FromNodePin;
  ULONG ToNode;
  ULONG ToNodePin;
} KSTOPOLOGY_CONNECTION, *PKSTOPOLOGY_CONNECTION;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field FromNode

Specifies the node ID of the node on the upstream end of the connection. If this end of the connection is an external pin on the filter -- not a logical pin on a node--set this member to the null node-ID value, KSFILTER_NODE.


### -field FromNodePin

Specifies the pin ID for the upstream end of the connection. If <b>FromNode </b>is KSFILTER_NODE, the pin on this end of the connection is an external pin on the filter. If not, the pin on this end is a logical pin on an internal node.


### -field ToNode

Specifies the node ID of the node on the downstream end of the connection. If this end of the connection is an external pin on the filter--not a logical pin on a node -- set this member to the null node-ID value, KSFILTER_NODE.


### -field ToNodePin

Specifies the pin ID for the downstream end of the connection. If <b>ToNode</b> is KSFILTER_NODE, the pin on this end of the connection is an external pin on the filter. If not, the pin on this end is a logical pin on an internal node.


## -remarks
KSTOPOLOGY_CONNECTION represents a single connection inside a filter, between either external pins, internal nodes, or an external pin and an internal node.

A streaming driver returns an array of KSTOPOLOGY_CONNECTION structures in response to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565802">KSPROPERTY_TOPOLOGY_CONNECTIONS</a> get-property request.

When representing a connection between two external pins, both <b>FromNode</b> and <b>ToNode</b> should be set to KSFILTER_NODE, and the <b>FromNodePin</b> and <b>ToNodePin</b> should be the pin type ID of the respective pins. (See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566584">KSPROPSETID_Pin</a> for a description of pin type IDs.)

Otherwise, <b>FromNodePin</b> or <b>ToNodePin</b> represent a logical incoming or outgoing pin for the connection. The logical pin numbers are used solely to describe a connection between nodes; they have no existence outside of the KSPROPERTY_TOPOLOGY_CONNECTIONS property.

The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537688">PCCONNECTION_DESCRIPTOR</a> structure name is an alias for KSTOPOLOGY_CONNECTION.
