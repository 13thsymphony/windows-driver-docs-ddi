# KsCreateDevice function
The<b> KsCreateDevice </b>function creates an AVStream device.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS KsCreateDevice(
  _In_            PDRIVER_OBJECT      DriverObject,
  _In_            PDEVICE_OBJECT      PhysicalDeviceObject,
  _In_opt_  const KSDEVICE_DESCRIPTOR *Descriptor,
  _In_            ULONG               ExtensionSize,
  _Out_opt_       PKSDEVICE           *Device
);
````

## Parameters

`DriverObject`

A pointer to the WDM driver object of the minidriver.

`PhysicalDeviceObject`

A pointer to the WDM physical device object for the device you want to create under AVStream.

`Descriptor`

A pointer to a device descriptor that describes the characteristics of the device being created. If the caller does not specify this optional parameter, AVStream creates a device with default characteristics and no associated filter factories.

`ExtensionSize`

This parameter contains the size of the device extension. If this is zero, the default extension size is used. If not, it must be at least sizeof (KSDEVICE_HEADER).

`Device`

A pointer to a memory location that contains the address of the created <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_ksdevice.md">KSDEVICE</a> structure. Optional.


## Return Value

Returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the device is created successfully. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate error code.

## Remarks

Normally, the minidriver does not call this function directly. Instead, <b>KsCreateDevice</b> is called by the default <i>AddDevice</i> handler, <a href="..\ks\nf-ks-ksadddevice.md">KsAddDevice</a>. Because <b>KsAddDevice</b> makes an internal call to <b>KsCreateDevice</b>, drivers that call <b>KsCreateDevice</b> should not call <b>KsAddDevice</b> separately.

A minidriver that calls <b>KsCreateDevice</b> directly should not use <a href="..\ks\nf-ks-ksinitializedriver.md">KsInitializeDriver</a>. If the minidriver is not calling <b>KsInitializeDriver</b>, it should instead provide its own <i>AddDevice</i> callback. The minidriver can then call <b>KsCreateDevice</b> from that <i>AddDevice</i> callback. 

If no <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_ksdevice_descriptor.md">KSDEVICE_DESCRIPTOR</a> is provided, AVStream creates a device with the default characteristics and no associated filter factories. If a KSDEVICE_DESCRIPTOR is supplied and contains a <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_ksdevice_dispatch.md">KSDEVICE_DISPATCH</a> table with a create dispatch, the create dispatch is called.
