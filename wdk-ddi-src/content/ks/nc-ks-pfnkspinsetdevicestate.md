# PFNKSPINSETDEVICESTATE callback function
An AVStream minidriver's <i>AVStrMiniPinSetDeviceState</i> routine is called when the state of a <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_kspin.md">KSPIN</a> structure is changed due to the arrival of a connection state property 'set' IOCTL.  Typically, this will be provided by minidrivers that need to change the state of hardware.

## Syntax

```
PFNKSPINSETDEVICESTATE Pfnkspinsetdevicestate;

NTSTATUS Pfnkspinsetdevicestate(
  PKSPIN Pin,
  KSSTATE ToState,
  KSSTATE FromState
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Pin`

Pointer to the <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_kspin.md">KSPIN</a> structure for which state is changing.

`ToState`

The target <a href="..\ks\ne-ks-pksstate.md">KSSTATE</a> after receipt of the IOCTL.

`FromState`

The previous <a href="..\ks\ne-ks-pksstate.md">KSSTATE</a>.


## Return Value

Return STATUS_SUCCESS or the error code that was returned from the attempt to set the state. Do not return STATUS_PENDING. The filter control mutex is held during this function. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/402795a0-e567-4e7e-a7d8-b2ce29ffb8fd">Filter Control Mutex in AVStream</a>.

## Remarks

The minidriver specifies this routine's address in the <b>SetDeviceState</b> member of its <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_kspin_dispatch.md">KSPIN_DISPATCH</a> structure.

Minidrivers will not receive a stop upon initial connection of the pin.

Pins that use the standard transport mechanism (standard interface/standard medium or an explicit use of KSPIN_FLAG_USE_STANDARD_TRANSPORT in <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_kspin_descriptor_ex.md">KSPIN_DESCRIPTOR_EX</a>) receive filtered state changes through the owning pipe through this routine. This means that no transition will be more than a single step. In other words, <b>KSSTATE_STOP</b> transitions to KSSTATE_ACQUIRE, <b>KSSTATE_ACQUIRE</b> transitions to KSSTATE_PAUSE, and so on. In addition, state changes received in this routine represent the state of the pipe as a whole, not the individual state of the pin as reported in the <b>DeviceState</b> member of the KSPIN structure.

Pins that do not use the standard transport mechanism (nonstandard interface, nonstandard medium, or an explicit use of KSPIN_FLAG_DO_NOT_USE_STANDARD_TRANSPORT in <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_kspin_descriptor_ex.md">KSPIN_DESCRIPTOR_EX</a>) receive nonfiltered state changes through this routine. As such, nonstandard transport pins must be prepared to deal with state changes that jump more than a single step. As an example, consider a jump from <b>KSSTATE_RUN</b> to <b>KSSTATE_STOP</b> without an intervening KSSTATE_PAUSE. In addition, the state reported to this routine will be identical to the state reported in the <b>DeviceState</b> member of the relevant KSPIN structure.

This routine is optional.
