# PFNKSCORRELATEDTIME callback function
A streaming minidriver's <i>KStrCorrelatedTime</i> routine is called to retrieve both the presentation time and physical time in a correlated manner. This allows the clock owner to completely determine the current time.

## Syntax

```
PFNKSCORRELATEDTIME Pfnkscorrelatedtime;

LONGLONG Pfnkscorrelatedtime(
  PVOID Context,
  PLONGLONG SystemTime
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Context`

Pointer to the minidriver-supplied information context. The minidriver passes the information context to <a href="..\ks\nf-ks-ksallocatedefaultclockex.md">KsAllocateDefaultClockEx</a> in the function's <i>DeferredContext</i> parameter when the minidriver allocates a custom DPC timer object.

`SystemTime`

Specifies a pointer to a variable that receives the performance counter frequency.


## Return Value

Returns the value of the performance counter in units of ticks.

## Remarks

Typically, if a minidriver supplies a <i>KStrCorrelatedTime</i> callback function, the minidriver must also supply <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567203">KStrSetTimer</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567156">KStrCancelTimer</a> callback functions.

The minidriver-supplied <i>KStrCorrelatedTimer </i>must have the same characteristics as <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-kequeryperformancecounter.md">KeQueryPerformanceCounter</a>.
