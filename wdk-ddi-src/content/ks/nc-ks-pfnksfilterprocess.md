# PFNKSFILTERPROCESS callback function
An AVStream minidriver's <i>AVStrMiniFilterProcess</i> routine is called when the filter is meant to process frames. It is used to perform <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e56c5102-7ea6-4687-ae5e-1550db9500f0">Filter-Centric Processing</a>.

## Syntax

```
PFNKSFILTERPROCESS Pfnksfilterprocess;

NTSTATUS Pfnksfilterprocess(
  PKSFILTER Filter,
  PKSPROCESSPIN_INDEXENTRY Index
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Filter`

Pointer to the <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_ksfilter.md">KSFILTER</a> structure that must process frames.

`Index`




## Return Value

Return STATUS_SUCCESS to continue processing. Return STATUS_PENDING to stop processing until the next triggering event. The minidriver may return an error code, but this will be treated as described for STATUS_PENDING.

## Remarks

The minidriver specifies this routine's address in the <b>Process</b> member of its <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_ksfilter_dispatch.md">KSFILTER_DISPATCH</a> structure.

The routine is called at either IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL or PASSIVE_LEVEL depending on the preference expressed in the filter descriptor. Filter descriptors that specify KSFILTER_FLAG_DISPATCH_LEVEL_PROCESSING may have their process callback at DISPATCH_LEVEL; filter descriptors that do not specify this flag will have their process callback at PASSIVE_LEVEL.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e56c5102-7ea6-4687-ae5e-1550db9500f0">Filter-Centric Processing</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f60d4dbd-61e6-4ae2-aa43-9edc8f36c3ff">Restarting Processing in AVStream</a>.

This routine is optional.
