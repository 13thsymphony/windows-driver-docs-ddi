# KsAcquireDeviceSecurityLock function
The <b>KsAcquireDeviceSecurityLock</b> function acquires the security lock associated with a device object. An exclusive lock is acquired when changing a security descriptor. When manipulating the security of any object under a particular device object, this lock must be acquired.

## Syntax

````
VOID KsAcquireDeviceSecurityLock(
  _In_ KSDEVICE_HEADER Header,
  _In_ BOOLEAN         Exclusive
);
````

## Parameters

`Header`

Points to a driver-allocated device header, previously allocated by <b>KsAllocateDeviceHeader,</b> for the device object described by the KSDEVICE_HEADER structure.

`Exclusive`

Indicates, if set to <b>TRUE</b>, that the lock is to be acquired exclusively.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

A shared lock is acquired when validating access during a create. An exclusive lock is acquired when changing a security descriptor.
