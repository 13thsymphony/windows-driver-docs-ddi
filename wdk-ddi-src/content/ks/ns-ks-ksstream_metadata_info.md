# KSSTREAM_METADATA_INFO structure
This structure contains the metadata information that is passed down to the driver.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct KSSTREAM_METADATA_INFO {
  ULONG BufferSize;
  ULONG UsedSize;
  PVOID Data;
  PVOID SystemVa;
  ULONG Flags;
  ULONG Reserved;
} *PKSSTREAM_METADATA_INFO, KSSTREAM_METADATA_INFO;
```

## Members


`BufferSize`

This value is set by the user mode component and is equal to the MaxMetadataBufferSize supplied by the driver.

`UsedSize`

The size of the metadata written by the driver in the SystemVa buffer.

`Data`

The metadata buffer that is passed down by the user mode component. This is mapped to <i>SystemVa</i>.

`SystemVa`

The buffer that is used by the driver to fill with metadata.

`Flags`

Set to KSCAMERA_EXTENDEDPROP_METADATA_SYSTEMMEMORY if the metadata buffer is allocated from the system memory.

`Reserved`
