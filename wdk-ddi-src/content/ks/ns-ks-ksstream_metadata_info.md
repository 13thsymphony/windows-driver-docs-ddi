# KSSTREAM_METADATA_INFO structure
This structure contains the metadata information that is passed down to the driver.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct {
  ULONG                               BufferSize;
  ULONG                               UsedSize;
  Field_size_bytes_(BufferSize) PVOID Data;
  Field_size_bytes_(BufferSize) PVOID SystemVa;
  ULONG                               Flags;
  ULONG                               Reserved;
} KSSTREAM_METADATA_INFO, *PKSSTREAM_METADATA_INFO;
````

## Members


`BufferSize`

This value is set by the user mode component and is equal to the MaxMetadataBufferSize supplied by the driver.

`Data`

The metadata buffer that is passed down by the user mode component. This is mapped to <i>SystemVa</i>.

`Flags`

Set to KSCAMERA_EXTENDEDPROP_METADATA_SYSTEMMEMORY if the metadata buffer is allocated from the system memory.

`Reserved`

Reserved for system use.

`SystemVa`

The buffer that is used by the driver to fill with metadata.

`UsedSize`

The size of the metadata written by the driver in the SystemVa buffer.
