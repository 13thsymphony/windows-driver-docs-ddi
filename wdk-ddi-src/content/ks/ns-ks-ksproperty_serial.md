# KSPROPERTY_SERIAL structure
The KSPROPERTY_SERIAL structure is a header that is included for each property that follows a KSPROPERTY_SERIALHDR structure.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct {
  KSIDENTIFIER PropTypeSet;
  ULONG        Id;
  ULONG        PropertyLength;
} KSPROPERTY_SERIAL, *PKSPROPERTY_SERIAL;
````

## Members


`Id`

Specifies the identifier for this property.

`PropertyLength`

Specifies the length, in bytes, of the following property data. This does not include any alignment buffering that may be appended to the property data before the next property in the serialization.

`PropTypeSet`

A structure of type <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-ksidentifier.md">KSIDENTIFIER</a> that specifies the type of property data. This is the same information obtained from querying Basic Support.

## Remarks
A KSPROPERTY_SERIAL structure is followed by the property data, with the start of each property on FILE_LONG_ALIGNMENT. Note that the serial header structure itself is also defined to be on FILE_LONG_ALIGNMENT.

## Requirements
