# KsMethodHandler function
The <b>KsMethodHandler</b> function handles methods requested through IOCTL_KS_METHOD. It works with all method identifiers defined by the sets. The function can only be called at PASSIVE_LEVEL.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS KsMethodHandler(
  _In_       PIRP         Irp,
  _In_       ULONG        MethodSetsCount,
  _In_ const KSMETHOD_SET *MethodSet
);
````

## Parameters

`Irp`

Specifies the IRP with the method request being handled.

`MethodSetsCount`

Indicates the number of method set structures being passed.

`MethodSet`

Specifies the pointer to the list of method set information.


## Return Value

The <b>KsMethodHandler</b> function returns STATUS_SUCCESS if successful, or an error specific to the method being handled if unsuccessful. The function always sets the IO_STATUS_BLOCK.Information field of the PIRP.IoStatus element within the IRP to zero because of an internal error, unless the element is set by a method handler. The function does not set the IO_STATUS_BLOCK.Status field nor complete the IRP.

## Remarks

The owner of a method set can perform prefiltering or postfiltering of the method handling using the <b>KsMethodHandler</b> and <b>KsFastMethodHandler </b>functions.
