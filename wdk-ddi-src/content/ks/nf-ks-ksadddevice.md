# KsAddDevice function
The<b> KsAddDevice </b>function is the default <i>AddDevice</i> handler installed by <a href="..\ks\nf-ks-ksinitializedriver.md">KsInitializeDriver</a>.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS KsAddDevice(
  _In_ PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject,
  _In_ PDEVICE_OBJECT PhysicalDeviceObject
);
````

## Parameters

`DriverObject`

A pointer to the WDM driver object for the minidriver.

`PhysicalDeviceObject`

A pointer to the WDM physical device object.


## Return Value

Returns STATUS_SUCCESS indicating the device was successfully created or an error status from <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iocreatedevice.md">IoCreateDevice</a> or <a href="..\ks\nf-ks-ksinitializedevice.md">KsInitializeDevice</a>.

## Remarks

Normally, an AVStream minidriver does not call this function directly.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554081">AddDevice Routine for AVStream Minidrivers</a>.

<b>KsAddDevice</b> extracts the device descriptor stored in the device extension allocated from a call to <a href="..\ks\nf-ks-ksinitializedriver.md">KsInitializeDriver</a> and creates the device described by it. If <b>KsInitializeDriver</b> is not used to initialize the driver, this function creates a device with the default characteristics and no filter factories. The minidriver always has the option of calling <a href="..\ks\nf-ks-kscreatedevice.md">KsCreateDevice</a> directly, in which case the driver extension is not used by AVStream. Because <b>KsAddDevice</b> calls <b>KsCreateDevice</b>, drivers that call <b>KsAddDevice</b> should not call <b>KsCreateDevice</b> separately.
