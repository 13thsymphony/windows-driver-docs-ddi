# IKsReferenceClock::GetCorrelatedTime method



## -description
The <b>IKsReferenceClock::GetCorrelatedTime</b> method queries the associated reference clock for current stream time and acquires the correlated system time.



## -syntax

````
LONGLONG GetCorrelatedTime(
  [out] PLONGLONG SystemTime
);
````


## -parameters

### -param SystemTime [out]

A pointer to a LONGLONG-typed variable that receives the current system time in 100 nanosecond units.


## -returns
The <b>IKsReferenceClock::GetCorrelatedTime</b> method returns the stream time, specified by default in 100-nanosecond units. The correlated system time is returned in <i>SystemTime</i>.


## -remarks
Use this method to determine the difference between stream time and system time. <b>IKsReferenceClock::GetCorrelatedTime</b> returns the times that both clocks show at the same moment.

For the most accurate results, call this method only when the stream is in a running state (KSSTATE_RUN) and not during a state transition.

You should use this method when obtaining a time stamp to put in the <b>PresentationTime</b> member of <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-ksstream_header.md">KSSTREAM_HEADER</a>.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fc1d5bca-72e3-48e2-b46f-09a13bba83b4">AVStream Clocks</a>.

AVStream uses the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564465">KSPROPERTY_CLOCK_CORRELATEDTIME</a> property to retrieve the correlated time.
