# PKSCORRELATED_TIME structure



## -description
The KSCORRELATED_TIME structure contains a clock time as well as the corresponding number of clock ticks since system boot.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct {
  LONGLONG Time;
  LONGLONG SystemTime;
} KSCORRELATED_TIME, *PKSCORRELATED_TIME;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Time

Specifies the current clock time in 100-nanosecond units.


### -field SystemTime

A 64-bit integer containing the number of clock ticks since system boot.


## -remarks
Supply this structure in a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564465">KSPROPERTY_CLOCK_CORRELATEDTIME</a> property request.

The system time is acquired from <a href="kernel.kequeryperformancecounter">KeQueryPerformanceCounter</a>. Note that the performance counter is not suspended when the machine is suspended, so that correlations change when the machine goes through a suspend.
