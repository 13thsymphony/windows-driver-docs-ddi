# KsFastMethodHandler function
The <b>KsFastMethodHandler</b> function handles fast methods requested through IOCTL_KS_METHOD. It responds to all method identifiers defined by the sets that are also contained in the fast I/O list. This function can only be called at PASSIVE_LEVEL.

## Syntax

````
BOOLEAN KsFastMethodHandler(
  _In_          PFILE_OBJECT     FileObject,
  _In_          PKSMETHOD        Method,
  _In_          ULONG            MethodLength,
  _Inout_       PVOID            Data,
  _In_          ULONG            DataLength,
  _Out_         PIO_STATUS_BLOCK IoStatus,
  _In_          ULONG            MethodSetsCount,
  _In_    const KSMETHOD_SET     *MethodSet
);
````

## Parameters

`FileObject`

Specifies the file object on which the request was made.

`Method`

Specifies the original method parameter. This will always be on FILE_LONG_ALIGNMENT, but may not be on FILE_QUAD_ALIGNMENT.

`MethodLength`

Specifies the length indicated by the caller of the method parameter.

`Data`

Specifies the original unaligned data parameter.

`DataLength`

Specifies the length indicated by the caller of the data parameter.

`IoStatus`

Specifies an aligned structure that is used to return error status and information.

`MethodSetsCount`

Indicates the number of method set structures being passed.

`MethodSet`

Specifies the pointer to the list of method set information.


## Return Value

The <b>KsFastMethodHandler</b> function returns <b>TRUE</b> if the request is handled, or <b>FALSE</b> if the request is not handled. If the request is not handled, an IRP is generated. If the request was handled, the function sets the IoStatus-&gt;Information element to zero because of an internal error or the element is set by a method handler. The method handler also sets the IoStatus-&gt;Status field when the method is handled.

## Remarks

The owner of a method set can perform prefiltering or postfiltering of the method handling using the <b>KsFastMethodHandler</b> and <b>KsMethodHandler </b>functions. The <b>KsFastMethodHandler</b> function is used to process requests made through the fast I/O dispatch interface for Device Control. It is only used to process requests that can be fulfilled quickly. The <i>Wait</i> parameter of the fast I/O function is not passed and assumed to be <b>TRUE</b>.
