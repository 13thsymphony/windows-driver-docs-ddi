# KsFilterAttemptProcessing function
The<b> KsFilterAttemptProcessing</b> function attempts to initiate processing on <i>Filter</i>.

## Syntax

````
void KsFilterAttemptProcessing(
  _In_ PKSFILTER Filter,
  _In_ BOOLEAN   Asynchronous
);
````

## Parameters

`Filter`

A pointer to a <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_ksfilter.md">KSFILTER</a> structure representing the AVStream filter object on which to attempt processing.

`Asynchronous`

This parameter contains an indication as to whether the processing dispatch should occur asynchronously or not (should it occur). An asynchronous dispatch is guaranteed if this is <b>TRUE</b>; however, synchronous processing dispatches are governed by conditions described below.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

If the minidriver calls <b>KsFilterAttemptProcessing</b> when all of the conditions required to process data are met, a processing dispatch occurs. For more information about the process callback, see <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_ksfilter_dispatch.md">KSFILTER_DISPATCH</a>. In order for the attempt to result in an actual dispatch, the filter's process control gate must be in an open state. Unlike pin-centric processing, filter-centric processing has many conditions that affect the process control gate. For more information about these requirements, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e56c5102-7ea6-4687-ae5e-1550db9500f0">Filter-Centric Processing</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/0b6a02c2-e672-4568-a890-491c721ec3a7">Pin-Centric Processing</a>.

If the process control gate is open, a processing dispatch occurs, either synchronously or asynchronously. If the caller specifies <b>TRUE</b> in the <i>Asynchronous</i> parameter, the processing dispatch always occurs asynchronously in a work item. However, if the caller requests a synchronous processing dispatch, the dispatch occurs synchronously only if the system is currently at an IRQL at which the minidriver can handle processing. If the system is at PASSIVE_LEVEL, the dispatch is guaranteed to happen synchronously. Conversely, if the system is at DISPATCH_LEVEL, the dispatch happens synchronously only if KSFILTER_FLAG_DISPATCH_LEVEL_PROCESSING is specified on the filter. Otherwise, a work item is queued to perform processing.

Note that this is only an attempt at processing; calling this function does not guarantee that processing will commence. Processing occurs only if the process control gate is "open." For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f60d4dbd-61e6-4ae2-aa43-9edc8f36c3ff">Restarting Processing in AVStream</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c5592f92-a432-44e3-afe0-60fcf917a443">Flow Control Gates in AVStream</a>.
