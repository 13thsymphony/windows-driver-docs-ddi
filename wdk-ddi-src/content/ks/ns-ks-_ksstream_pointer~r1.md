# _KSSTREAM_POINTER structure



## -description
The KSSTREAM_POINTER structure is the basic AVStream pointer into a stream.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _KSSTREAM_POINTER {
  PVOID                    Context;
  PKSPIN                   Pin;
  PKSSTREAM_HEADER         StreamHeader;
  PKSSTREAM_POINTER_OFFSET Offset;
  KSSTREAM_POINTER_OFFSET  OffsetIn;
  KSSTREAM_POINTER_OFFSET  OffsetOut;
} KSSTREAM_POINTER, *PKSSTREAM_POINTER;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Context

A pointer to client-requested context information. The leading edge and trailing edge stream pointers have this member set to <b>NULL</b>. Cloned stream pointers can specify that they wish to have context information via the mechanism described in <a href="stream.ksstreampointerclone">KsStreamPointerClone</a>. 


### -field Pin

A pointer to the <a href="stream.kspin">KSPIN</a> structure to which this stream pointer belongs.


### -field StreamHeader

A pointer to the stream header object for the data frame that this stream pointer currently points to. See <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-ksstream_header.md">KSSTREAM_HEADER</a> for more information.


### -field Offset

A pointer to a structure of type <a href="stream.ksstream_pointer_offset">KSSTREAM_POINTER_OFFSET</a>. Points to either <b>OffsetIn</b> or <b>OffsetOut</b> depending on whether the pin to which this stream pointer belongs is an input pin or output pin.


### -field OffsetIn

This member specifies a structure of type <a href="stream.ksstream_pointer_offset">KSSTREAM_POINTER_OFFSET</a> describing the data currently pointed to by the stream pointer.


### -field OffsetOut

This member specifies a structure of type <a href="stream.ksstream_pointer_offset">KSSTREAM_POINTER_OFFSET</a>. Use this member to output data on an output pin.


## -remarks
A queue object for a stream has at minimum one hard-defined stream pointer: the leading-edge stream pointer. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/73ab974f-8034-421f-980a-2393d84ec54c">Leading and Trailing Edge Stream Pointers</a>.

For general information about stream pointers, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/4bac68a0-34d2-431a-9ed9-8a42751a736f">Stream Pointers</a>.
