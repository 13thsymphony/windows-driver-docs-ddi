# KSQUERYBUFFER structure



## -description
The KSQUERYBUFFER structure is used when querying for outstanding buffers available on an event with KSEVENT_TYPE_QUERYBUFFER<b>.</b>



## -syntax

````
typedef struct {
  KSEVENT      Event;
  PKSEVENTDATA EventData;
  PVOID        Reserved;
} KSQUERYBUFFER, *PKSQUERYBUFFER;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Event

Specifies the description of the original event, with the KSEVENT_TYPE_QUERYBUFFER flag set instead of the KSEVENT_TYPE_ENABLEBUFFERED flag.


### -field EventData

A pointer to a <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-kseventdata.md">KSEVENTDATA</a> structure. This is the same pointer supplied to <a href="..\ks\nc-ks-pfnksaddevent.md">AVStrMiniAddEvent</a> at event enable time. This pointer is used as the unique identifier in locating the event, just as it is used when disabling the event.


### -field Reserved

Not used, and set to zero.


## -remarks
If KSEVENT_TYPE_ENABLEBUFFERED was used to enable an event that also buffers data, then the data produced by the event can be queried using this method. The description of the event being queried is provided as the first parameter, and any buffer is provided as the second parameter to the query.

The buffer length needed can be queried by providing a zero length output buffer. The size of buffer is returned in the <b>BytesReturned</b> parameter, with a warning status of STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW.

Alternatively, the query returns one of the following status values:

STATUS_NOT_FOUND

event was not found

STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER

it was not being buffered

STATUS_NO_MORE_ENTRIES

no buffers were available

STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL

buffer size was insufficient.

STATUS_SUCCESS

life is good.
