# KsGateRemoveOnInputFromOr function
The<b> KsGateRemoveOnInputFromOr </b>function removes an existing input that is in the ON state from an OR gate.

## Syntax

````
void __inline KsGateRemoveOnInputFromOr(
  _In_ PKSGATE OrGate
);
````

## Parameters

`OrGate`

A pointer to a <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_ksgate.md">KSGATE</a> structure representing the OR gate from which to remove an ON input.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

Removing the last ON input from a given OR gate results in the gate closing and the transition being propagated to any gates connected to <i>OrGate</i>. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c5592f92-a432-44e3-afe0-60fcf917a443">Flow Control Gates in AVStream</a>.

<b>KsGateRemoveOnInputFromOr</b> should only be used on gates that were specifically created as AND gates; AVStream does not verify that the given gate is an AND gate.

This call is an inline function call to <a href="..\ks\nf-ks-ksgateturninputoff.md">KsGateTurnInputOff</a>. If conceptually removing an existing input to a gate, a minidriver should call <b>KsGateRemoveOnInputFromOr</b> rather than <b>KsGateTurnInputOff</b>.
