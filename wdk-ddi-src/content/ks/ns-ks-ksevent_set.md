# KSEVENT_SET structure



## -description
The KSEVENT_SET structure describes the events that comprise a kernel streaming event set.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct {
  const GUID         *Set;
  ULONG              EventsCount;
  const KSEVENT_ITEM *EventItem;
} KSEVENT_SET, *PKSEVENT_SET;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Set

Specifies a GUID that identifies the event set. For more information about defined event sets, see <b>Remarks</b>.


### -field EventsCount

Specifies the number of events in the event set.


### -field EventItem

Points to the beginning of the array of <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-ksevent_item.md">KSEVENT_ITEM</a> structures that describe each event in the event set. The size of the array is in the <b>EventsCount</b> member.


## -remarks
Microsoft provides several system-defined kernel streaming event set GUIDs. Minidrivers specify one of these GUIDs in the <b>Set</b> member. Kernel streaming event sets typically begin with a <i>KSEVENTSETID</i> prefix. Event set GUIDs are defined in <i>ks.h</i>, <i>ksmedia.h</i>, <i>bdamedia.h</i>, and possibly other header files.
