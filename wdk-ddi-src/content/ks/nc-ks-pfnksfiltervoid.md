# PFNKSFILTERVOID callback function
An AVStream minidriver's <i>AVStrMiniFilterReset</i> routine is called when AVStream receives an IOCTL_KS_RESET_STATE to return the filter to the state it was in at <i>Acquire</i>-time. This routine is also called when a queue associated with a pin on the filter is flushed. <i>This routine will only be called for a filter-centric filter</i>.

## Syntax

```
PFNKSFILTERVOID Pfnksfiltervoid;

NTSTATUS Pfnksfiltervoid(
  PKSFILTER Filter
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Filter`

Pointer to the <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_ksfilter.md">KSFILTER</a> to return to its previous state.


## Return Value

AVStream does not currently use the return value.

## Remarks

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/e56c5102-7ea6-4687-ae5e-1550db9500f0">Filter-Centric Processing</a>.

Note that it is not the filter in question, but rather a pin on this filter that actually receives the reset IOCTL.

The minidriver specifies this routine's address in the <b>Reset</b> member of its <a href="..\ks\ns-ks-_ksfilter_dispatch.md">KSFILTER_DISPATCH</a> structure.

The filter control mutex may be held during this function. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/402795a0-e567-4e7e-a7d8-b2ce29ffb8fd">Filter Control Mutex in AVStream</a>.

This routine is optional.
