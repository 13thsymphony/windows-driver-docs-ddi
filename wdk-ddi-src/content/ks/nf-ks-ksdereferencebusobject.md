# KsDereferenceBusObject function



## -description
<p>Dereferences the bus Physical Device Object.</p>


## -syntax

````
VOID KsDereferenceBusObject(
  _In_Â KSDEVICE_HEADER Header
);
````


## -parameters
<dl>

### -param Header [in]

<dd>
<p>Points to a header previously allocated by <b>KsAllocateDeviceHeader</b> that also contains the PnP device stack object.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

## -returns
<p>None.</p>

## -remarks
<p>This is used by filters that use the device header to keep track of the corresponding PnP object stack. This is normally called when closing a filter, if required by the bus for the given device. As an example, a software device would require such a call. This call matches a previous call to <a href="..\ks\nf-ks-ksreferencebusobject.md">KsReferenceBusObject</a> when opening the filter instance. The caller must have previously also called <b>KsSetDevicePnpAndBaseObject</b> in order to set the PnP device stack object. This would have been done in the PnP <b>AddDevice</b> function. The function calls the <b>DereferenceDeviceObject</b> method on the previously retrieved interface. The interface itself is released and freed when the device header is freed.</p>
