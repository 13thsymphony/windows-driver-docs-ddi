# KsDereferenceBusObject function
Dereferences the bus Physical Device Object.

## Syntax

````
VOID KsDereferenceBusObject(
  _In_Â KSDEVICE_HEADER Header
);
````

## Parameters

`Header`

Points to a header previously allocated by <b>KsAllocateDeviceHeader</b> that also contains the PnP device stack object.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

This is used by filters that use the device header to keep track of the corresponding PnP object stack. This is normally called when closing a filter, if required by the bus for the given device. As an example, a software device would require such a call. This call matches a previous call to <a href="..\ks\nf-ks-ksreferencebusobject.md">KsReferenceBusObject</a> when opening the filter instance. The caller must have previously also called <b>KsSetDevicePnpAndBaseObject</b> in order to set the PnP device stack object. This would have been done in the PnP <b>AddDevice</b> function. The function calls the <b>DereferenceDeviceObject</b> method on the previously retrieved interface. The interface itself is released and freed when the device header is freed.
