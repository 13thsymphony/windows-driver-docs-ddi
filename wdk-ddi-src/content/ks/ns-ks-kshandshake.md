# KSHANDSHAKE structure
The KSHANDSHAKE structure is used to pass information back and forth while pins are handshaking in an attempt to negotiate a private interface.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct {
  GUID  ProtocolId;
  PVOID Argument1;
  PVOID Argument2;
} KSHANDSHAKE, *PKSHANDSHAKE;
````

## Members


`Argument1`

A pointer to an interface-dependent argument. Most often, this is used to pass back and forth COM-style interface pointers once a specific private interface or protocol has been agreed upon.

`Argument2`

A pointer to an interface-dependent argument.

`ProtocolId`

This member specifies the GUID that represents the interface or protocol being negotiated between two AVStream pins.

## Remarks
See <a href="..\ks\nf-ks-kspinhandshake.md">KsPinHandshake</a> for more information about negotiating private interfaces between AVStream pins.

Pin handshaking is a concept that is usable only between two pins that support IOCTL_KS_HANDSHAKE. Currently, only AVStream pins support this interface; thus this is only useful for negotiating private interfaces between two AVStream pins. Currently, connections between AVStream pins are negotiated via this mechanism.
