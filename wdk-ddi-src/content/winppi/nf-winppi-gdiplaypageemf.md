# GdiPlayPageEMF function
The <b>GdiPlayPageEMF</b> function plays the EMF records within a specified rectangle for one document page of a spooled print job.

## Syntax

````
BOOL GdiPlayPageEMF(
   HANDLE SpoolFileHandle,
   HANDLE hemf,
   RECT   *prectDocument,
   RECT   *prectBorder,
   RECT   *prectClip
);
````

## Parameters

`SpoolFileHandle`

Caller-supplied spool file handle, obtained by a previous call to <a href="..\winppi\nf-winppi-gdigetspoolfilehandle.md">GdiGetSpoolFileHandle</a>.

`hemf`

Caller-supplied page handle, obtained by calling <a href="..\winppi\nf-winppi-gdigetpagehandle.md">GdiGetPageHandle</a>, identifying the page for which records are to be played.

`prectDocument`

Caller-supplied pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff569234">RECT</a> structure specifying the rectangle into which the page is to be drawn.

`prectBorder`

Caller-supplied pointer to a RECT structure specifying the page's border rectangle (if any). Can be <b>NULL</b>.

`prectClip`

Caller-supplied pointer to a RECT structure specifying the coordinates of the page's clip region (if any). Can be <b>NULL</b>.


## Return Value

If the operation succeeds, the function returns <b>TRUE</b>. Otherwise the function returns <b>FALSE</b>, and an error code can be obtained by calling <b>GetLastError</b>.

## Remarks

The <b>GdiPlayPageEMF</b> function is exported by gdi32.dll for use within a print processor's <a href="..\winsplp\nf-winsplp-printdocumentonprintprocessor.md">PrintDocumentOnPrintProcessor</a> function.

The <b>GdiPlayPageEMF</b> function is the means by which a print processor positions a document page or a specified rectangular region of a document page on a physical page. Note that <b>GdiPlayPageEMF</b> does not actually print on the device context, but instead prepares a data structure that describes the text and graphics that are to be printed on the physical page(s). The text and graphics are printed to the device context when <a href="..\winppi\nf-winppi-gdiendpageemf.md">GdiEndPageEMF</a> is called.

The print processor uses <i>prectClip</i> to describe the rectangular region to be printed, and <i>prectDocument</i> to describe a rectangle into which the document page (or clipped region) must fit. If<i> prectClip</i> is <b>NULL</b>, the entire document page will be printed. For non-<b>NULL</b> values of <i>prectClip</i>, only the portion of the document page within the clip region will be printed. The <b>GdiPlayPageEMF</b> function then performs the scaling and translation operations required to make the document page (or selected portion) fit into the rectangle.

The <i>prectBorder</i> parameter, if it is non-<b>NULL</b>, describes a solid-line border rectangle to be drawn around the document page. If <i>prectBorder</i> is <b>NULL</b>, no such border will be drawn.
