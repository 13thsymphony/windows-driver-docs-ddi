# VmbPacketSendWithExternalMdl function



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[Some information relates to pre-released product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.]

The <b>VmbPacketSendWithExternalMdl</b> function sends the data in a packet buffer or external data Memory Descriptor List (MDL). The function associates that data with the VMBus packet object, which represents the packet
throughout the lifetime of the transaction.



## -syntax

````
NTSTATUS
 VmbPacketSendWithExternalMdl(
  _In_ __drv_aliasesMem VMBPACKET       PacketObject,
  _In_ reads_bytes_(BufferLength) PVOID Buffer,
  _In_ UINT32                           BufferLength,
  _In_ PMDL                             ExternalDataMdl,
  _In_ UINT32                           MdlOffset,
  _In_ UINT32                           MdlLength,
  _In_ UINT32                           Flags
);

## -parameters

### -param PacketObject [in]

A handle to the VMBus packet object.




### -param Buffer [in]

A buffer that contains the command packet that is sent
through the VMBus ring buffer.


### -param BufferLength [in]

The length, in bytes, of the buffer in the <i>Buffer</i> parameter. 


### -param ExternalDataMdl [in]

 An MDL that describes a data buffer associated with     the packet. 


### -param MdlOffset [in]

The offset from the buffer described by the MDL where the
data starts.



### -param MdlLength [in]

The length of the sub-buffer to send. Use 0 for the entire     MDL.



### -param Flags [in]

  Flags. The following are pertinent flags:


<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>

### -param VMBUS_CHANNEL_FORMAT_FLAG_WAIT_FOR_COMPLETION

</td>
<td width="60%">
 This packet cannot be considered complete and its resources cannot be released until a
completion packet comes back from the opposite endpoint. This flag must be set.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>

### -param VMBUS_CHANNEL_FORMAT_FLAG_FORCE_MDL_LENGTH

</td>
<td width="60%">
Always use <i>MdlLength</i> for the
length of the external data MDL, even if this length is longer than the
<b>ByteCount</b> field of the MDL. This only allows exceeding the length of the MDL by
rounding up to a page boundary. If this flag is set, only the first MDL in the
MDL chain is used.


</td>
</tr>
<tr>

### -param VMBUS_CHANNEL_FORMAT_FLAG_PAGED_BUFFER

</td>
<td width="60%">
 The inline buffer is
paged and must be treated accordingly, which means it must be copied before entering DPC level.
Probing user-mode buffers or handling access violations is the
responsibility of the caller.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


## -returns
<b>VmbPacketSendWithExternalMdl</b> returns a status code.


## -remarks
This function differs from the <a href="..\vmbuskernelmodeclientlibapi\nf-vmbuskernelmodeclientlibapi-vmbpacketsend.md">VmbPacketSend</a> function in that it allows passing an MDL offset and MDL length.
