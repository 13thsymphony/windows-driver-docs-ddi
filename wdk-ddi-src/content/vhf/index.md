# Vhf.h header



This header is used by Human Interface Devices (HID). For more information, see
- [Human Interface Devices (HID)](../_hid/index.md)

Vhf.h contain these programming interfaces:


## Functions

| Title   | Description   |
| ---- |:---- |
| [VHF_CONFIG_INIT function](nf-vhf-vhf_config_init.md) | Use the VHF_CONFIG_INIT function to initialize the required members of the VHF_CONFIG structure allocated by the HID source driver. |
| [VhfAsyncOperationComplete function](nf-vhf-vhfasyncoperationcomplete.md) | The HID source driver calls this method to set the results of an asynchronous operation. |
| [VhfCreate function](nf-vhf-vhfcreate.md) | The HID source driver calls this method to create a virtual HID device. |
| [VhfDelete function](nf-vhf-vhfdelete.md) | The HID Source device driver calls this method to delete a VHF device. |
| [VhfReadReportSubmit function](nf-vhf-vhfreadreportsubmit.md) | The HID source driver calls this method to submit a HID Read (Input) Report to Virtual HID Framework (VHF). |
| [VhfStart function](nf-vhf-vhfstart.md) | The HID source driver calls this method to start the virtual HID device. |

## Callback functions

| Title   | Description   |
| ---- |:---- |
| [EVT_VHF_ASYNC_OPERATION callback](nc-vhf-evt_vhf_async_operation.md) | The HID source driver implements this event callback if it wants to support one of the four asynchronous operation to get and set HID reports. |
| [EVT_VHF_CLEANUP callback](nc-vhf-evt_vhf_cleanup.md) | The HID source driver implements this event callback to free resources that might the driver allocated to the virtual HID device. |
| [EVT_VHF_READY_FOR_NEXT_READ_REPORT callback](nc-vhf-evt_vhf_ready_for_next_read_report.md) | The HID source driver implements this event call back function to use its buffering scheme for HID Input Reports, and wants to get notified when the next report can be submitted to VHF. |

## Structures
| Title | Description |
| ---- |:---- |
| [_HID_XFER_PACKET](ns-vhf-_hid_xfer_packet.md) | The HID_XFER_PACKET structure contains information about a HID report that the HID class driver uses with I/O requests to get or set a report. |
| [_VHF_CONFIG](ns-vhf-_vhf_config.md) | Contains initial configuration information that is provided by the HID source driver when it calls VhfCreate to create a virtual HID device. |
