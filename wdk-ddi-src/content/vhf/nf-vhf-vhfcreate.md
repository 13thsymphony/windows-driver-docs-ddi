# VhfCreate function
The HID source driver calls this method to create a virtual HID device.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS VhfCreate(
  [in]  PVHF_CONFIG VhfConfig,
  [out] VHFHANDLE   *VhfHandle
);
````

## Parameters

`VhfConfig`

A pointer to a <a href="..\vhf\ns-vhf-_vhf_config.md">VHF_CONFIG</a> structure.

`VhfHandle`

A handle to the new virtual HID device.


## Return Value

If the <b>VhfCreate</b> call succeeds, the method returns STATUS_SUCCESS. Otherwise an appropriate <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7792201b-63bb-4db5-803d-2af02893d505">NTSTATUS </a> value.

## Remarks

This method returns synchronously after validating the <a href="..\vhf\ns-vhf-_vhf_config.md">VHF_CONFIG</a> structure and creating a virtual HID device. The virtual HID device is only reported to PnP. The initialization, installation, and starting of the device may not complete before this method returns.

A Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) driver can call <b>VhfCreate</b> at any point after successfully creating its own device object by calling <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicecreate.md">WdfDeviceCreate</a>. The driver can do so in its <a href="..\wdfdriver\nc-wdfdriver-evt_wdf_driver_device_add.md">EvtDriverDeviceAdd</a>, <a href="..\wdfdevice\nc-wdfdevice-evt_wdf_device_prepare_hardware.md">EvtDevicePrepareHardware</a>, <a href="..\wdfdevice\nc-wdfdevice-evt_wdf_device_d0_entry.md">EvtDeviceD0Entry</a>, <a href="..\wdfdevice\nc-wdfdevice-evt_wdf_device_self_managed_io_init.md">EvtDeviceSelfManagedIoInit</a>.

VHF does not invoke any callback functions that are specified in <a href="..\vhf\ns-vhf-_vhf_config.md">VHF_CONFIG</a> until the HID source driver calls <a href="..\vhf\nf-vhf-vhfstart.md">VhfStart</a>.
