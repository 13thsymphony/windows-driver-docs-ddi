# UcxIoDeviceControl function



## -description
    Allows USB host controller extension (UCX) to handle an  I/O control code (IOCTL) request from user mode.  



## -syntax

````
BOOL UcxIoDeviceControl(
  [in] WDFDEVICE  Device,
  [in] WDFREQUEST Request,
  [in] size_t     OutputBufferLength,
  [in] size_t     InputBufferLength,
  [in] ULONG      IoControlCode
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Device [in]

A handle to the framework device object that the client driver retrieved in the previous call to <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicecreate.md">WdfDeviceCreate</a>.


### -param Request [in]

A handle to a framework request object that represents the user-mode IOCTL request. 


### -param OutputBufferLength [in]

The length, in bytes, of the request's output buffer, if an output buffer 
        is available.


### -param InputBufferLength [in]

The length, in bytes, of the request's input buffer, if an input buffer 
        is available.


### -param IoControlCode [in]

The driver-defined or system-defined IOCTL that is 
        associated with the request.


## -returns
If the operation is successful, the method returns TRUE. Otherwise it returns FALSE.


## -remarks
The client driver can call this method to allow UCX to handle IOCTLs listed in this table: <a href="usb_interfaces.htm#um_ioctl">User-Mode IOCTLs for USB</a>. If the IOCTL code is <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537276">IOCTL_USB_DIAGNOSTIC_MODE_OFF</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537277">IOCTL_USB_DIAGNOSTIC_MODE_ON</a>, UCX completes the request successfully. For IOCTLS that are used to retrieve the USB host controllers
    driver key name, such as <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537326">IOCTL_USB_GET_ROOT_HUB_NAME</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537236">IOCTL_GET_HCD_DRIVERKEY_NAME</a>, UCX retrieves the Unicode string. If the user mode IOCTL is <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537344">IOCTL_USB_USER_REQUEST</a>, the input and output buffer lengths must be equal and the output buffer must contain the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff539187">USBUSER_REQUEST_HEADER</a> structure. For the remaining IOCTLs, UCX  returns FALSE and the client driver can provide its own handling logic.
