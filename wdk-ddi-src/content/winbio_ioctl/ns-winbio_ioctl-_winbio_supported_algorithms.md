# _WINBIO_SUPPORTED_ALGORITHMS structure
The WINBIO_SUPPORTED_ALGORITHMS structure is the OUT payload for <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536438">IOCTL_BIOMETRIC_GET_SUPPORTED_ALGORITHMS</a>.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct _WINBIO_SUPPORTED_ALGORITHMS {
  DWORD       PayloadSize;
  HRESULT     WinBioHresult;
  DWORD       NumberOfAlgorithms;
  WINBIO_DATA AlgorithmData;
} *PWINBIO_SUPPORTED_ALGORITHMS, WINBIO_SUPPORTED_ALGORITHMS;
```

## Members


`PayloadSize`

Specifies the total size of the payload, which includes the fixed length structure and any variable data at the end.

`WinBioHresult`

Specifies the HRESULT status of the I/O operation.

`NumberOfAlgorithms`

Specifies the number of algorithms in the data block.

`AlgorithmData`

Specifies a structure of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536469">WINBIO_DATA</a> that contains NULL-terminated UTF-8 OID strings that represent the algorithms supported by the device.
