# _WINBIO_DIAGNOSTICS structure
The <a href="..\winbio_ioctl\ni-winbio_ioctl-ioctl_biometric_get_sensor_status.md">IOCTL_BIOMETRIC_GET_SENSOR_STATUS</a> IOCTL returns the WINBIO_DIAGNOSTICS structure as output.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _WINBIO_DIAGNOSTICS {
  DWORD                PayloadSize;
  HRESULT              WinBioHresult;
  WINBIO_SENSOR_STATUS SensorStatus;
  WINBIO_DATA          VendorDiagnostics;
} WINBIO_DIAGNOSTICS, *PWINBIO_DIAGNOSTICS;
````

## Members


`PayloadSize`

The total size of the payload.  This includes the fixed length structure and any variable data at the end.

`SensorStatus`

A structure of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536476">WINBIO_SENSOR_STATUS</a> that contains the operating status of the biometric sensor.

`VendorDiagnostics`

An optional <a href="..\winbio_ioctl\ns-winbio_ioctl-_winbio_data.md">WINBIO_DATA</a> structure for vendor-specific additional information.

`WinBioHresult`

The status detail of the I/O operation.  This is where WINBIO error and information codes will be passed. The following table shows possible values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Status value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
S_OK

</td>
<td>
The operation completed successfully.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
HRESULT_FROM_NT(STATUS_IO_DEVICE_ERROR)

</td>
<td>
The driver could not gather the necessary information from the device.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
