## Members

        
            `Capabilities`

            A WINBIO_CAPABILITIES subtype, which indicates which capabilities are supported by the device. 

WINBIO_CAPABILITIES can contain the values in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>
       
        Biometric capability value
       
      </th>
<th>
       
        Description
       
      </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WINBIO_CAPABILITY_SENSOR 

</td>
<td>
The device can collect biometric data.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WINBIO_CAPABILITY_MATCHING

</td>
<td>
The device can perform match operations.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WINBIO_CAPABILITY_STORAGE

</td>
<td>
The device can store biometric templates.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WINBIO_CAPABILITY_SECURE_STORAGE

</td>
<td>
The device can store secure data that is associated with a template.  The secure data is only released with a positive match.  The device must support at least the SHA-1 algorithm for secure hash computation to be used to store templates in the system pool.

</td>
</tr>

<td>
WINBIO_CAPABILITY_PROCESSING

</td>
<td>
The device can process samples and turn them into biometric templates.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WINBIO_CAPABILITY_ENCRYPTION

</td>
<td>
The device supports encryption of samples and templates.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WINBIO_CAPABILITY_SIGNING

</td>
<td>
The device can sign captured data.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WINBIO_CAPABILITY_NAVIGATION

</td>
<td>
The device can be used as a navigation device.  Some devices and drivers can capture data in a format that can be translated by a user-mode application into navigation events, much like a mouse.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WINBIO_CAPABILITY_INDICATOR

</td>
<td>
The device has an indicator that can be turned on or off.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WINBIO_CAPABILITY_VIRTUAL_SENSOR

</td>
<td>
The sensor adapter manages its own connection to the biometric hardware.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This constant applies only for Windows 10 and later.</div>
<div> </div>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WINBIO_CAPABILITY_SECURE_SENSOR

</td>
<td>
The device supports security methods available in the WinBio engine adapter interface version 4.0  or later.

</table>
        
            `FirmwareVersion`

            A structure of type <a href="..\winbio_types\ns-winbio_types-_winbio_version.md">WINBIO_VERSION</a> that contains the version of the firmware that is loaded on the device.
        
            `ManufacturerName`

            A structure of type WINBIO_STRING that contains the name of the device manufacturer.
        
            `ModelName`

            A structure of type WINBIO_STRING that contains the name of the device model.
        
            `PayloadSize`

            A DWORD value that indicates the total size of the payload, including the fixed length structure and any variable data at the end.
        
            `SensorSubType`

            A WINBIO_BIOMETRIC_SENSOR_SUBTYPE subtype that contains additional information about the sensor.  For example, this member could specify whether the sensor requires the user to simply touch the sensor or swipe a finger over the sensor.

WINBIO_BIOMETRIC_SENSOR_SUBTYPE can contain the values in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>
              
                Biometric subtype value

</td>
</tr>
</table>
        
            `SensorType`

            A DWORD bitmask of type WINBIO_BIOMETRIC_TYPE that contains biometric data that is collected by the sensor. In Windows 7, only WINBIO_TYPE_FINGERPRINT is supported.
        
            `SerialNumber`

            A structure of type WINBIO_STRING that contains the serial number of the device, if one exists.

</tr>
</table>
        
            `WinBioVersion`

            A structure of type <a href="..\winbio_types\ns-winbio_types-_winbio_version.md">WINBIO_VERSION</a> that contains a WinBio WBDI version that is supported by the driver. To be compatible with the WinBio service, <b>WinBioVersion</b> must contain the same major version as the current major version of the WinBio service, in addition to a minor version that is less than or equal to the current minor version of the WinBio service.
