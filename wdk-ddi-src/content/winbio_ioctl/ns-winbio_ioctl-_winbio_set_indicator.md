# _WINBIO_SET_INDICATOR structure
The WINBIO_SET_INDICATOR structure is the IN payload for <a href="..\winbio_ioctl\ni-winbio_ioctl-ioctl_biometric_set_indicator.md">IOCTL_BIOMETRIC_SET_INDICATOR</a>.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _WINBIO_SET_INDICATOR {
  DWORD                   PayloadSize;
  WINBIO_INDICATOR_STATUS IndicatorStatus;
} WINBIO_SET_INDICATOR, *PWINBIO_SET_INDICATOR;
````

## Members


`IndicatorStatus`

Specifies a WINBIO_INDICATOR_STATUS that indicates whether the indicator light should be set on or off.

 Possible values are shown in the following table. 
<table>
<tr>
<td>
Indicator status code

</td>
<td>
Description

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WINBIO_INDICATOR_ON

</td>
<td>
The indicator light is on, and changes according to the sensor status.  To be able to set WINBIO_INDICATOR_ON, you must set WINBIO_CAPABILITY_INDICATOR in the <b>Capabilities</b> member of the WINBIO_SENSOR_ATTRIBUTES structure.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WINBIO_INDICATOR_OFF

</td>
<td>
The sensor indicator light is off.  Sensors that do not have an indicator light will always return this value in IOCTL_GET_SENSOR_STATUS. 

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`PayloadSize`

Specifies the total size of the payload, which includes the fixed length structure and any variable data at the end.
