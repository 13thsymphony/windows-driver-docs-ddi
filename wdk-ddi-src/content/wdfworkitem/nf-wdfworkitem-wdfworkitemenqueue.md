# WdfWorkItemEnqueue function
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]

The <b>WdfWorkItemEnqueue</b> method adds a specified framework work-item object to the system's work-item queue.

## Syntax

````
VOID WdfWorkItemEnqueue(
  _In_ WDFWORKITEM WorkItem
);
````

## Parameters

`WorkItem`

A handle to a framework work-item object that is obtained from a previous call to <a href="..\wdfworkitem\nf-wdfworkitem-wdfworkitemcreate.md">WdfWorkItemCreate</a>.


## Return Value

None.

A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.

## Remarks

After the driver calls <a href="..\wdfworkitem\nf-wdfworkitem-wdfworkitemcreate.md">WdfWorkItemCreate</a> to create a work item, the driver must call <b>WdfWorkItemEnqueue</b> to add the work item to the system's work-item queue. A system worker thread subsequently removes the work item from the queue and calls the work item's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2a2811de-9024-40a8-b8af-b61ca4100218">EvtWorkItem</a> callback function. The system removes the work items in the order that they were added to the queue.

Before drivers call <b>WdfWorkItemEnqueue</b>, they typically use the work-item object's context memory to store information about the work item. The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2a2811de-9024-40a8-b8af-b61ca4100218">EvtWorkItem</a> callback function uses this information to determine the operation that it must perform.

For versions 1.7 and later of KMDF, if your driver reuses its work-item objects, the driver can call <b>WdfWorkItemEnqueue</b> again for the same work item before a system worker thread has dequeued the work item and subsequently called the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2a2811de-9024-40a8-b8af-b61ca4100218">EvtWorkItem</a> callback function. However, KMDF will not add the work item to the queue if it is already there. Therefore, your <i>EvtWorkItem</i> callback function must process all queued work each time that it is called.

Your driver can also call <b>WdfWorkItemEnqueue</b> while an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2a2811de-9024-40a8-b8af-b61ca4100218">EvtWorkItem</a> callback function is running, to queue another work item. The second work item's <i>EvtWorkItem</i> callback might even run before the first one completes.

In versions of KMDF prior to version 1.7, if your driver reuses its work-item objects, it must not call <b>WdfWorkItemEnqueue</b> again for the same work item until a system worker thread has dequeued the work item and called its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2a2811de-9024-40a8-b8af-b61ca4100218">EvtWorkItem</a> callback function.
