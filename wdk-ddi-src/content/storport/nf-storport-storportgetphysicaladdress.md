# StorPortGetPhysicalAddress function
The <b>StorPortGetPhysicalAddress</b> routine converts a given virtual address range to a physical address range for a DMA operation.

## Syntax

````
STORPORT_API STOR_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS StorPortGetPhysicalAddress(
  _In_     PVOID               HwDeviceExtension,
  _In_opt_ PSCSI_REQUEST_BLOCK Srb,
  _In_     PVOID               VirtualAddress,
  _Out_    ULONG               *Length
);
````

## Parameters

`HwDeviceExtension`

A pointer to the hardware device extension. This is a per HBA storage area that the port driver allocates and initializes on behalf of the miniport driver. Miniport drivers usually store HBA-specific information in this extension, such as the state of the HBA and the mapped access ranges for the HBA. This area is available to the miniport driver in the <b>DeviceExtension-&gt;HwDeviceExtension</b> member of the device object for the HBA immediately after the miniport driver calls <a href="..\storport\nf-storport-storportinitialize.md">StorPortInitialize</a>. The port driver frees this memory when it removes the device.

`Srb`

Pointer to the SCSI request block if the virtual address to be converted comes from that SRB's <b>DataBuffer</b> member or <b>SenseInfoBuffer</b> member. Otherwise, this parameter must be <b>NULL</b>.

`VirtualAddress`

Pointer to the base virtual address to be converted. If this virtual address falls within the range for an SRB-supplied <b>DataBuffer</b>, the caller also must provide the <i>Srb</i> pointer.

`Length`

Pointer to a value indicating the number of bytes mapped, starting at the returned physical address.


## Return Value

<b>StorPortGetPhysicalAddress</b> returns the corresponding physical address for a given virtual address. If the given address cannot be converted, the function returns <b>NULL</b>.

## Remarks

If the virtual address passed to <b>StorPortGetPhysicalAddress</b> is obtained from <a href="..\storport\nf-storport-storportallocatecontiguousmemoryspecifycachenode.md">StorPortAllocateContiguousMemorySpecifyCacheNode</a>, the value returned for <i>Length</i> should be ignored.

Starting in Windows 8, the <i>Srb</i> parameter may point to either <a href="..\storport\ns-storport-_scsi_request_block.md">SCSI_REQUEST_BLOCK</a> or <a href="..\storport\ns-storport-_storage_request_block.md">STORAGE_REQUEST_BLOCK</a>. If the function identifier in the <b>Function</b> field of <i>Srb</i> is <b>SRB_FUNCTION_STORAGE_REQUEST_BLOCK</b>, the SRB is a <b>STORAGE_REQUEST_BLOCK</b> request structure.

<b>StorPortGetPhysicalAddress</b> uses <b>STOR_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS</b> to represent physical addresses.

<div class="code"><span codelanguage="ManagedCPlusPlus"><table>
<tr>
<th>C++</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>typedef PHYSICAL_ADDRESS STOR_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS, *PSTOR_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS;
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
The <b>STOR_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS</b> type is an operating system-independent data type that Storport miniport drivers use to represent either a physical addresses or a bus-relative address.
