# HW_FIND_ADAPTER callback



## -description
The <b>HwStorFindAdapter</b> routine uses the supplied configuration to determine whether a specific HBA is supported and, if it is, to return configuration information about that adapter.



## -prototype

````
HW_FIND_ADAPTER HwStorFindAdapter;

ULONG HwStorFindAdapter(
          IN PVOID                        DeviceExtension,
  _In_    PVOID                           HwContext,
  _In_    PVOID                           BusInformation,
  _In_    IN PVOID                        ArgumentString,
  _Inout_ PPORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION ConfigInfo,
  _In_    PBOOLEAN                        Reserved3
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param DeviceExtension 

Supplies a per adapter storage area.


### -param HwContext [in]

Set to NULL.


### -param BusInformation [in]

Set to NULL.


### -param ArgumentString [in]

Supplies a <b>NULL</b>-terminated string with context information about the driver.


### -param ConfigInfo [in, out]

Supplies an initialized <a href="..\strmini\ns-strmini-_port_configuration_information.md">PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION</a> structure that the miniport driver uses during initialization.


### -param Reserved3 [in]

Reserved for system use. 


## -returns
<b>HwStorFindAdapter</b> must return one of the following status values:
<dl>
<dt><b>SP_RETURN_FOUND</b></dt>
</dl>Indicates that a supported HBA was found and that the HBA-relevant configuration information was successfully determined and set in the <a href="..\strmini\ns-strmini-_port_configuration_information.md">PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION</a> structure.
<dl>
<dt><b>SP_RETURN_ERROR</b></dt>
</dl>Indicates that an HBA was found but there was an error obtaining the configuration information. If possible, such an error should be logged with <a href="..\storport\nf-storport-storportlogerror.md">StorPortLogError</a>.
<dl>
<dt><b>SP_RETURN_BAD_CONFIG</b></dt>
</dl>Indicates that the supplied configuration information was invalid for the adapter.
<dl>
<dt><b>SP_RETURN_NOT_FOUND</b></dt>
</dl>Indicates that no supported HBA was found for the supplied configuration information.

 


## -remarks
Because the Storport driver supports only Plug and Play (PnP) devices, the <i>HwContext</i> and <i>BusInformation</i> parameters to <b>HwStorFindAdapter</b> are not supplied to non-virtual miniport drivers.

<b>HwStorFindAdapter</b> must set the <b>MaximumTransferLength</b> and <b>NumberOfPhysicalBreaks</b> fields in the <i>ConfigInfo</i> structure. Other than these fields, the <a href="..\strmini\ns-strmini-_port_configuration_information.md">PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION</a> structure will always fully specify all adapter resources that are required to start the adapter. 

The name <b>HwStorFindAdapter</b> is just a placeholder. The actual prototype of this routine is defined in <i>Storport.h</i> as follows:

In most cases StorPort calls the <b>HwStorFindAdapter</b> routine at IRQL == PASSIVE_LEVEL without acquiring any spin locks. The exception case is when the miniport does not support calling <a href="..\storport\nc-storport-hw_adapter_control.md">HwStorAdaptorControl</a> with the <b>ScsiRestartAdapter</b> control type. In this situation, StorPort will instead reinitialize the adapter by calling both  <b>HwStorFindAdapter</b> and <a href="..\storport\nc-storport-hw_initialize.md">HwStorInitialize</a>. When this is the case, <b>HwStorFindAdapter</b> is called at IRQL == DISPATCH_LEVEL. Also, when in dump mode, <b>HwStorFindAdapter</b> is called at IRQL == HIGH_LEVEL.

To define an <b>HwStorFindAdapter</b> callback function, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of callback function you’re defining. Windows provides a set of callback function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the callback function types helps <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2F3549EF-B50F-455A-BDC7-1F67782B8DCA">Code Analysis for Drivers</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/74feeb16-387c-4796-987a-aff3fb79b556">Static Driver Verifier</a> (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it’s a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

 For example, to define a <b>HwStorFindAdapter</b> callback routine that is named <i>MyHwFindAdapter</i>, use the <b>HW_FIND_ADAPTER</b> type as shown in this code example:

Then, implement your callback routine as follows:

The <b>HW_FIND_ADAPTER</b> function type is defined in the Storport.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation to your function definition. The _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the <b>HW_FIND_ADAPTER</b> function type in the header file are used. For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/40BD11CD-A559-4F90-BF39-4ED2FB800392">Declaring Functions Using Function Role Types for Storport Drivers</a>. For information about _Use_decl_annotations_, see <a href="c0aa268d-6fa3-4ced-a8c6-f7652b152e61">Annotating Function Behavior</a>.
