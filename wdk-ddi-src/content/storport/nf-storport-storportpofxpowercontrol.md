# StorPortPoFxPowerControl function
The <b>StorPortPoFxPowerControl</b> routine sends a power control request to the power management framework (PoFx) to forward to the power engine plug-in (PEP).

## Syntax

````
ULONG StorPortPoFxPowerControl(
  _In_      PVOID   HwDeviceExtension,
  _In_      LPCGUID PowerControlCode,
  _In_opt_  PVOID   InBuffer,
  _In_      SIZE_T  InBufferSize,
  _Out_opt_ PVOID   OutBuffer,
  _In_      SIZE_T  OutBufferSize,
  _Out_opt_ PSIZE_T BytesReturned
);
````

## Parameters

`HwDeviceExtension`

A pointer to the hardware device extension for the host bus adapter (HBA). This is the device extension used to register the device in a prior call to <a href="..\storport\nf-storport-storportinitializepofxpower.md">StorPortInitializePoFxPower</a>.

`Address`

TBD

`PowerControlCode`

A pointer to the power control code. This code is a GUID value that specifies the requested operation.

`InBuffer`

A pointer to a caller-allocated buffer that contains the input data for the operation. The format for the data in this buffer depends on the power control code specified by the <i>PowerControlCode</i> parameter. The <i>InBuffer</i> parameter is optional and can be specified as NULL if the specified operation requires no input data.

`InBufferSize`

The size, in bytes, of the input buffer that is pointed to by the <i>InBuffer</i> parameter. If <i>InBuffer</i> is NULL, set <i>InBufferSize</i> to zero.

`OutBuffer`

A pointer to a caller-allocated buffer that is to contain the output data from the operation. The format for the data in this buffer depends on the power control code specified by the <i>PowerControlCode</i> parameter. The <i>OutBuffer</i> parameter is optional and can be specified as NULL if the specified operation produces no output data.

`OutBufferSize`

The size, in bytes, of the output buffer that is pointed to by the <i>OutBuffer</i> parameter. If <i>OutBuffer</i> is NULL, set <i>OutBufferSize</i> to zero.

`BytesReturned`

A pointer to a location into which the routine writes the number of bytes of data that were written to the buffer that is pointed to by <i>OutBuffer</i>. The number of bytes written will be less than or equal to <i>OutBufferSize</i>. This parameter is optional and can be specified as <b>NULL</b> if the caller does not need to know how many bytes were written to the output buffer.


## Return Value

The <b>StorPortPoFxPowerControl</b> routine returns one of these status codes:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STOR_STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The power control operation specified in <i>PowerControlCode</i> was successfully executed.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STOR_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Either <i>HwDeviceExtension</i> or <i>Device</i> is NULL.

-or-

<i>Address</i> points to an invalid unit address structure.

-or-

The storage device specified by <i>Address</i> is not found.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STOR_STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_REQUEST</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The storage device is  not registered with the PoFx.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STOR_STATUS_INVALID_IRQL</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The current IRQL &gt; DISPATCH_LEVEL.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STOR_STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The power control operation was unsuccessful.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

A minport driver calls this routine to send a power control request directly to the PEP. A power control request is similar to an I/O control request (IOCTL). Unlike an IOCTL, however, a power control request is sent directly to PEP and is not observed by other device drivers in the device stack. During a <b>StorPortPoFxPowerControl</b> call, the PEP synchronously performs the requested operation.

Similarly, The PEP can send a power control request directly to the miniport. The miniport driver handles this request in its <a href="..\storport\nc-storport-hw_adapter_control.md">HwStorAdapterControl</a> and <a href="..\storport\nc-storport-hw_unit_control.md">HwStorUnitControl</a> routines. The <i>ControlType</i> parameter receives the <b>ScsiAdapterPoFxPowerControl</b> type in the <b>HwStorAdapterControl</b> routine and the <b>ScsiUnitPoFxPowerControl</b> in the <b>HwStorUnitControl</b> routine.
