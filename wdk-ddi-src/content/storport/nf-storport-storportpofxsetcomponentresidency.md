# StorPortPoFxSetComponentResidency function



## -description
The <b>StorPortPoFxSetComponentResidency</b> routine sets the estimated time for how long a storage device component is likely to remain idle after the component enters the idle condition.



## -syntax

````
ULONG StorPortPoFxSetComponentResidency(
  _In_     PVOID         HwDeviceExtension,
  _In_opt_ PSTOR_ADDRESS Address,
  _In_     ULONG         Component,
  _In_     ULONGLONG     Residency
);
````


## -parameters

### -param HwDeviceExtension [in]

A pointer to the hardware device extension for the host bus adapter (HBA). This is the device extension used to register the device in a prior call to <a href="..\storport\nf-storport-storportinitializepofxpower.md">StorPortInitializePoFxPower</a>.


### -param Address [in, optional]

The address of a storage device unit. This parameter is <b>NULL</b> when setting the residency of  a storage adapter component.


### -param Component [in]

The index that identifies the component. This parameter is an index into the <b>Components</b> array in the <a href="..\storport\ns-storport-_stor_pofx_device.md">STOR_POFX_DEVICE</a> structure that the miniport driver registered for the device with a call to <a href="..\storport\nf-storport-storportinitializepofxpower.md">StorPortInitializePoFxPower</a>. If the <b>Components</b> array contains N elements, component indexes range from 0 to N–1.


### -param Residency [in]

The estimated residency time, in 100-nanosecond units. This parameter is a hint to power management framework (PoFx) about how long the component is likely to remain idle after a transition from the active condition to the idle condition.


## -returns
The <b>StorPortPoFxSetComponentResidency</b> routine returns one of these status codes:
<dl>
<dt><b>STOR_STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>The component residency is successfully set.
<dl>
<dt><b>STOR_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</b></dt>
</dl>Either <i>HwDeviceExtension</i> or <i>Device</i> is NULL.

-or-

<i>Address</i> points to an invalid unit address structure.

-or-

The storage device specified by <i>Address</i> is not found.

-or-

The index in <i>Component</i> specifies a component greater than the component count for the device.
<dl>
<dt><b>STOR_STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_REQUEST</b></dt>
</dl>The storage device is  not registered with the PoFx.
<dl>
<dt><b>STOR_STATUS_INVALID_IRQL</b></dt>
</dl>The current IRQL &gt; DISPATCH_LEVEL.
