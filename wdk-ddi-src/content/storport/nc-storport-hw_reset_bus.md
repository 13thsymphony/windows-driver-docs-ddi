# HW_RESET_BUS callback function
The <b>HwStorResetBus</b> routine is called by the port driver to clear error conditions.

## Syntax

```
HW_RESET_BUS HwResetBus;

BOOLEAN HwResetBus(
  PVOID DeviceExtension,
  ULONG PathId
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`DeviceExtension`

A pointer to the miniport driver's per HBA storage area.

`PathId`

Identifies the SCSI bus to be reset.


## Return Value

If the bus is successfully reset, <b>HwStorResetBus</b> returns <b>TRUE</b>.

## Remarks

The name <b>HwStorResetBus</b> is just a placeholder. The actual prototype of this routine is defined in <i>Storport.h</i> as follows:

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>typedef
BOOLEAN
HW_RESET_BUS (
  _In_ PVOID  DeviceExtension,
  _In ULONG  PathId
  );</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
The port driver pauses all device IO queues for the adapter and then calls the <b>HwStorResetBus</b> routine at IRQL DISPATCH_LEVEL after acquiring the StartIo spin lock.  A miniport driver is responsible for completing SRBs received by <a href="..\storport\nc-storport-hw_startio.md">HwStorStartIo</a> for <i>PathId</i> during this routine and setting their status to SRB_STATUS_BUS_RESET if necessary.

In addition to the StartIo spin lock being taken and subsequently released after <b>HwStorResetBus</b> returns, if the miniport has requested multiple channel support through PERF_CONFIGURATION_DATA, all channel tokens will be taken and, on return of the callback, released.  This ensures that no IO’s are dispatched to <a href="..\storport\nc-storport-hw_startio.md">HwStorStartIo</a> during the reset bus phase.


#### Examples

To define an <b>HwStorResetBus</b> callback function, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of callback function you’re defining. Windows provides a set of callback function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the callback function types helps <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2F3549EF-B50F-455A-BDC7-1F67782B8DCA">Code Analysis for Drivers</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/74feeb16-387c-4796-987a-aff3fb79b556">Static Driver Verifier</a> (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it’s a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

 For example, to define a <b>HwStorResetBus</b> callback routine that is named <i>MyHwResetBus</i>, use the <b>HW_RESET_BUS</b> type as shown in this code example:

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>HW_RESET_BUS MyHwResetBus;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
Then, implement your callback routine as follows:

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>_Use_decl_annotations_
BOOLEAN
MyHwResetBus (
  _In_ PVOID  DeviceExtension,
  _In_ ULONG  PahtId
  );
  {
      ...
  }</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
The <b>HW_RESET_BUS</b> function type is defined in the Storport.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation to your function definition. The _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the <b>HW_RESET_BUS</b> function type in the header file are used. For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/40BD11CD-A559-4F90-BF39-4ED2FB800392">Declaring Functions Using Function Role Types for Storport Drivers</a>. For information about _Use_decl_annotations_, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj159529.aspx">Annotating Function Behavior</a>.
