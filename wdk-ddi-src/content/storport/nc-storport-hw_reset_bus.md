# HW_RESET_BUS callback function
The <b>HwStorResetBus</b> routine is called by the port driver to clear error conditions.

## Syntax

```
HW_RESET_BUS HwResetBus;

BOOLEAN HwResetBus(
  PVOID DeviceExtension,
  ULONG PathId
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`DeviceExtension`

A pointer to the miniport driver's per HBA storage area.

`PathId`

Identifies the SCSI bus to be reset.


## Return Value

If the bus is successfully reset, <b>HwStorResetBus</b> returns <b>TRUE</b>.

## Remarks

The name <b>HwStorResetBus</b> is just a placeholder. The actual prototype of this routine is defined in <i>Storport.h</i> as follows:
<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>typedef
BOOLEAN
HW_RESET_BUS (
  _In_ PVOID  DeviceExtension,
  _In ULONG  PathId
  );</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>The port driver pauses all device IO queues for the adapter and then calls the <b>HwStorResetBus</b> routine at IRQL DISPATCH_LEVEL after acquiring the StartIo spin lock.  A miniport driver is responsible for completing SRBs received by <a href="..\storport\nc-storport-hw_startio.md">HwStorStartIo</a> for <i>PathId</i> during this routine and setting their status to SRB_STATUS_BUS_RESET if necessary.

In addition to the StartIo spin lock being taken and subsequently released after <b>HwStorResetBus</b> returns, if the miniport has requested multiple channel support through PERF_CONFIGURATION_DATA, all channel tokens will be taken and, on return of the callback, released.  This ensures that no IO’s are dispatched to <a href="..\storport\nc-storport-hw_startio.md">HwStorStartIo</a> during the reset bus phase.
