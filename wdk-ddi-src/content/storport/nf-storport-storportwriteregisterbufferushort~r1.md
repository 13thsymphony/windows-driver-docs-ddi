# StorPortWriteRegisterBufferUshort macro



## -description
The <b>StorPortWriteRegisterBufferUshort</b> routine transfers a given number of USHORT values from a buffer to the HBA.



## -syntax

````
STORPORT_API VOID StorPortWriteRegisterBufferUshort(
  _In_ PVOID   HwDeviceExtension,
  _In_ PUSHORT Register,
  _In_ PUSHORT Buffer,
  _In_ ULONG   Count
);
````


## -parameters

### -param HwDeviceExtension [in]

A pointer to the hardware device extension. This is a per HBA storage area that the port driver allocates and initializes on behalf of the miniport driver. Miniport drivers usually store HBA-specific information in this extension, such as the state of the HBA and the mapped access ranges for the HBA. This area is available to the miniport driver immediately after the miniport driver calls <a href="storage.storportinitialize">StorPortInitialize</a>. The port driver frees this memory when it removes the device. 


### -param Register [in]

Pointer to the register. The given <i>Register</i> must be in a mapped memory space range that was returned by <a href="storage.storportgetdevicebase">StorPortGetDeviceBase</a>. 


### -param Buffer [in]

Pointer to a buffer containing the data to be written.


### -param Count [in]

Specifies the number of USHORT values to be transferred to the HBA.
