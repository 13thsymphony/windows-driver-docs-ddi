# HW_INTERRUPT callback function
The Storport driver calls the <b>HwStorInterrupt</b> routine after the HBA generates an interrupt request.

## Syntax

```
HW_INTERRUPT HwInterrupt;

BOOLEAN HwInterrupt(
  PVOID DeviceExtension
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`DeviceExtension`

A pointer to the miniport driver's per HBA storage area.


## Return Value

If the miniport driver finds that its HBA did not generate the interrupt, <b>HwStorInterrupt</b> should return <b>FALSE</b> as soon as possible. The <b>HwStorInterrupt</b> routine should return within 50 microseconds.

## Remarks

The name <b>HwStorInterrupt</b> is just a placeholder. The actual prototype of this routine is defined in <i>Storport.h</i> as follows:
<pre class="syntax" xml:space="preserve"><code>typedef
BOOLEAN
HW_INTERRUPT (
  IN PVOID  DeviceExtension
  );</code></pre>The <b>HwStorInterrupt</b> routine should return within 50 microseconds, ideally as short a time as possible. Therefore, all activity does not have to occur at high IRQL should be deferred to the <a href="..\storport\nc-storport-hw_dpc_routine.md">HwStorDpcRoutine</a> that is defined in the miniport driver and issued by using <a href="..\storport\nf-storport-storportissuedpc.md">StorPortIssueDpc</a>.  The latency of the DPC is very low, and it will be called immediately after the return from high IRQL.

The port driver calls the <b>HwStorInterrupt</b> routine at DIRQL.
