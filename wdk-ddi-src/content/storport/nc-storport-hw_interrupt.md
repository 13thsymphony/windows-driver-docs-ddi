# HW_INTERRUPT callback function
The Storport driver calls the <b>HwStorInterrupt</b> routine after the HBA generates an interrupt request.

## Syntax

```
HW_INTERRUPT HwInterrupt;

BOOLEAN HwInterrupt(
  PVOID DeviceExtension
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`DeviceExtension`

A pointer to the miniport driver's per HBA storage area.


## Return Value

If the miniport driver finds that its HBA did not generate the interrupt, <b>HwStorInterrupt</b> should return <b>FALSE</b> as soon as possible. The <b>HwStorInterrupt</b> routine should return within 50 microseconds.

## Remarks

The name <b>HwStorInterrupt</b> is just a placeholder. The actual prototype of this routine is defined in <i>Storport.h</i> as follows:

<pre class="syntax" xml:space="preserve"><code>typedef
BOOLEAN
HW_INTERRUPT (
  IN PVOID  DeviceExtension
  );</code></pre>
The <b>HwStorInterrupt</b> routine should return within 50 microseconds, ideally as short a time as possible. Therefore, all activity does not have to occur at high IRQL should be deferred to the <a href="..\storport\nc-storport-hw_dpc_routine.md">HwStorDpcRoutine</a> that is defined in the miniport driver and issued by using <a href="..\storport\nf-storport-storportissuedpc.md">StorPortIssueDpc</a>.  The latency of the DPC is very low, and it will be called immediately after the return from high IRQL.

The port driver calls the <b>HwStorInterrupt</b> routine at DIRQL.


#### Examples

To define an <b>HwStorInterrupt</b> callback function, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of callback function you’re defining. Windows provides a set of callback function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the callback function types helps <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2F3549EF-B50F-455A-BDC7-1F67782B8DCA">Code Analysis for Drivers</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/74feeb16-387c-4796-987a-aff3fb79b556">Static Driver Verifier</a> (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it’s a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

 For example, to define a <b>HwStorInterrupt</b> callback routine that is named <i>MyHwInterrupt</i>, use the <b>HW_INTERRUPT</b> type as shown in this code example:

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>HW_INTERRUPT MyHwInterrupt;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
Then, implement your callback routine as follows:

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>_Use_decl_annotations_
BOOLEAN
MyHwInterrupt (
  _In_ PVOID  DeviceExtension
  );
  {
      ...
  }</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
The <b>HW_INTERRUPT</b> function type is defined in the Storport.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation to your function definition. The _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the <b>HW_INTERRUPT</b> function type in the header file are used. For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/40BD11CD-A559-4F90-BF39-4ED2FB800392">Declaring Functions Using Function Role Types for Storport Drivers</a>. For information about _Use_decl_annotations_, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj159529.aspx">Annotating Function Behavior</a>.
