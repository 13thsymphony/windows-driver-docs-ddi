# HW_STATE_CHANGE callback



## -description
A miniport-provided callback that is called  after a notification from <a href="..\storport\nf-storport-storportstatechangedetected.md"> StorPortStateChangeDetected</a> is processed.



## -prototype

````
HW_STATE_CHANGE HwStorStateChange;

VOID HwStorStateChange(
  _In_     IN PVOID DeviceExtension,
  _In_opt_ PVOID    Context,
  _In_     SHORT    AddressType,
  _In_     PVOID    Address,
  _In_     ULONG    Status
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param DeviceExtension [in]

A pointer to the miniport driver's per-HBA storage area. 


### -param Context [in, optional]

The context supplied as <i>HwStateChangeContext</i> by the miniport in the call to <a href="..\storport\nf-storport-storportstatechangedetected.md"> StorPortStateChangeDetected</a>.


### -param AddressType [in]

The type of the address in <i>Address</i>.


### -param Address [in]

A pointer to a <a href="..\storport\ns-storport-_stor_address.md">STOR_ADDRESS</a> structure for the entity whose state change was processed.


### -param Status [in]

The processing status for the state change notification.


## -returns
None.


## -remarks
The <i>HwStorStateChange</i> is called with the StartIo lock acquired by Storport.

This callback enables miniports to do any additional processing that is needed after hardware addition or removal. If a hardware change occurs on the HBA port or bus, the miniport can call <a href="..\storport\nf-storport-storportstatechangedetected.md"> StorPortStateChangeDetected</a> to alert the system of the event.

If the value for <i>Status</i> is  &lt; 0x80000000, then the notification processing was successful. Otherwise, the notification process failed.

The name <i>HwStorStateChange</i> is just a placeholder for the miniport function that is pointed to by the <i>HwStateChange</i> parameter of  <a href="..\storport\nf-storport-storportstatechangedetected.md"> StorPortStateChangeDetected</a>. The actual prototype of this routine is defined in <i>Storport.h</i> as follows:
