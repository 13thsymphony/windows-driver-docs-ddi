# HW_INITIALIZE callback



## -description
The <b>HwStorInitialize</b> routine initializes the miniport driver after a system reboot or power failure occurs. It is called by StorPort after <a href="..\storport\nc-storport-hw_find_adapter.md">HwStorFindAdapter</a> successfully returns. <b>HwStorInitialize</b> initializes the HBA and finds all devices that are of interest to the miniport driver.



## -prototype

````
HW_INITIALIZE HwStorInitialize;

BOOLEAN HwStorInitialize(
   IN PVOID DeviceExtension
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param DeviceExtension 

A pointer to the miniport driver's per HBA storage area. 


## -returns
If the initialization succeeds, <b>HwStorInitialize</b> returns <b>TRUE</b>. 


## -remarks
The name <b>HwStorInitialize</b> is just a placeholder. The actual prototype of this routine is defined in <i>Storport.h</i> as follows:

Because <b>HwStorInitialize</b> is called at DIRQL, as much of the initialization process as possible should be performed by <a href="..\storport\nc-storport-hw_passive_initialize_routine.md">HwStorPassiveInitializeRoutine</a>. If so, you must enable the passive initialization routine via <a href="..\storport\nf-storport-storportenablepassiveinitialization.md">StorPortEnablePassiveInitialization</a>. 

If interrupts are generated by the hardware initialization, the <a href="..\storport\nc-storport-hw_interrupt.md">HwStorInterrupt</a> routine will be called. In this case, the <b>HwStorInitialize</b> routine should set up any data that <b>HwStorInterrupt</b> expects (including a <a href="..\storport\nc-storport-hw_dpc_routine.md">HwStorDpcRoutine</a>, if one is used) before it begins to initialize the hardware. 

The following responsibilities are shared between <b>HwStorInitialize</b> and <a href="..\storport\nc-storport-hw_passive_initialize_routine.md">HwStorPassiveInitializeRoutine</a>:

Initialize hardware for the HBA registers and buffers.

Initialize and allocate all <i>DeviceExtension</i> fields.

Set up and initialize all events and DPCs that are used by the miniport driver.

To define an <b>HwStorInitialize</b> callback function, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of callback function you’re defining. Windows provides a set of callback function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the callback function types helps <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2F3549EF-B50F-455A-BDC7-1F67782B8DCA">Code Analysis for Drivers</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/74feeb16-387c-4796-987a-aff3fb79b556">Static Driver Verifier</a> (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it’s a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

 For example, to define a <b>HwStorInitialize</b> callback routine that is named <i>MyHwInitialize</i>, use the <b>HW_INITIALIZE</b> type as shown in this code example:

Then, implement your callback routine as follows:

The <b>HW_INITIALIZE</b> function type is defined in the Storport.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation to your function definition. The _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the <b>HW_INITIALIZE</b> function type in the header file are used. For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/40BD11CD-A559-4F90-BF39-4ED2FB800392">Declaring Functions Using Function Role Types for Storport Drivers</a>. For information about _Use_decl_annotations_, see <a href="c0aa268d-6fa3-4ced-a8c6-f7652b152e61">Annotating Function Behavior</a>.
