# HW_INITIALIZE callback function
The <b>HwStorInitialize</b> routine initializes the miniport driver after a system reboot or power failure occurs. It is called by StorPort after <a href="..\storport\nc-storport-hw_find_adapter.md">HwStorFindAdapter</a> successfully returns. <b>HwStorInitialize</b> initializes the HBA and finds all devices that are of interest to the miniport driver.

## Syntax

```
HW_INITIALIZE HwInitialize;

BOOLEAN HwInitialize(
  PVOID DeviceExtension
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`DeviceExtension`

A pointer to the miniport driver's per HBA storage area.


## Return Value

If the initialization succeeds, <b>HwStorInitialize</b> returns <b>TRUE</b>.

## Remarks

The name <b>HwStorInitialize</b> is just a placeholder. The actual prototype of this routine is defined in <i>Storport.h</i> as follows:
<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>typedef
BOOLEAN
HW_INITIALIZE (
  _In_ PVOID  DeviceExtension
  );</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>Because <b>HwStorInitialize</b> is called at DIRQL, as much of the initialization process as possible should be performed by <a href="..\storport\nc-storport-hw_passive_initialize_routine.md">HwStorPassiveInitializeRoutine</a>. If so, you must enable the passive initialization routine via <a href="..\storport\nf-storport-storportenablepassiveinitialization.md">StorPortEnablePassiveInitialization</a>. 

If interrupts are generated by the hardware initialization, the <a href="..\storport\nc-storport-hw_interrupt.md">HwStorInterrupt</a> routine will be called. In this case, the <b>HwStorInitialize</b> routine should set up any data that <b>HwStorInterrupt</b> expects (including a <a href="..\storport\nc-storport-hw_dpc_routine.md">HwStorDpcRoutine</a>, if one is used) before it begins to initialize the hardware. 

The following responsibilities are shared between <b>HwStorInitialize</b> and <a href="..\storport\nc-storport-hw_passive_initialize_routine.md">HwStorPassiveInitializeRoutine</a>:
<ul>
<li>
Initialize hardware for the HBA registers and buffers.

</li>
<li>
Initialize and allocate all <i>DeviceExtension</i> fields.

</li>
<li>
Set up and initialize all events and DPCs that are used by the miniport driver.

</li>
</ul>
