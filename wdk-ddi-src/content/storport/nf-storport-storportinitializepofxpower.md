# StorPortInitializePoFxPower function
A miniport driver calls <b>StorPortInitializePoFxPower</b> to register a storage device with the power management framework (PoFx).

## Syntax

````
ULONG StorPortInitializePoFxPower(
  _In_     PVOID             HwDeviceExtension,
  _In_opt_ PSTOR_ADDRESS     Address,
  _In_     PSTOR_POFX_DEVICE Device,
  _Inout_  PBOOLEAN          D3ColdEnabled
);
````

## Parameters

`HwDeviceExtension`

A pointer to the hardware device extension for the host bus adapter (HBA).

`Address`

The address of a storage device unit. This parameter is <b>NULL</b> when registering for a storage adapter.

`Device`

A pointer to a <b>STOR_POFX_DEVICE_V2</b> structure cast to a pointer to <a href="..\storport\ns-storport-_stor_pofx_device.md">STOR_POFX_DEVICE</a>. This structure contains a component list with F-states for a storage device.

`D3ColdEnabled`

A pointer to a <b>BOOLEAN</b> value which the Storport driver will set to indicate whether the D3 Cold state is enabled for the storage device.


## Return Value

The <b>StorPortInitializePoFxPower</b> routine returns one of these status codes:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STOR_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Either <i>HwDeviceExtension</i> or <i>Device</i> is NULL.

-or-

<i>Address</i> points to an invalid unit address structure.

-or-

The storage device specified by <i>Address</i> is not found.

-or-

The <a href="..\storport\ns-storport-_stor_pofx_device.md">STOR_POFX_DEVICE</a> structure pointed to by  <i>Device</i> is formatted incorrectly or contains invalid data.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STOR_STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The storage device was successfully registered with PoFx.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STOR_STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Sufficient resources are not available to register the storage device with PoFx.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STOR_STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The storage device was not successfully registered with PoFx.

-or-

The storage device is already registered with PoFx.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

Adapter devices are always registered with a <b>NULL</b> value for <i>address</i>. Unit devices are registered by specifying a valid unit address for <i>address</i>.

If the <b>STOR_POFX_DEVICE_FLAG_ENABLE_D3_COLD</b> flag is set in the <b>Flags</b> member of <i>Device</i>, Storport will attempt to enable D3 Cold support for the device component. The D3 Cold enabled status is returned in the <b>BOOLEAN</b> value pointed to by <i>D3ColdEnabled</i>.
