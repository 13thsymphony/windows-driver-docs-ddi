# _STOR_RICH_DEVICE_DESCRIPTION structure
<p class="CCE_Message">[Some information relates to pre-released product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.]

The <b>STOR_RICH_DEVICE_DESCRIPTION</b> structure describes the attributes of the <b> physical device </b> for which a driver is requesting a DMA (direct memory access) adapter.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _STOR_RICH_DEVICE_DESCRIPTION {
  ULONG Version;
  ULONG Size;
  Char  VendorId[STOR_VENDOR_ID_LENGTH +1];
  Char  ModelNumber[STOR_MODEL_NUMBER_LENGTH + 1];
  Char  FirmwareRevision[STOR_FIRMWARE_REVISION_LENGTH + 1];
} STOR_RICH_DEVICE_DESCRIPTION, *PSTOR_RICH_DEVICE_DESCRIPTION;
````

## Members


`FirmwareRevision`

A string representing the device’s currently active firmware revision.

`ModelNumber`

A string representing the device’s model.

`Size`

The size of the structure.

`VendorId`

A string representing the device’s vendor ID. May be an empty string if ModelNumber is provided.

`Version`

The version of the structure. Must be STOR_RICH_DEVICE_DESCRIPTION_STRUCTURE_VERSION.

## Remarks
Miniport can choose to support this UnitControl if the device reports longer Model or Firmware information than defined in SCSI.

This is invoked during the Unit enumeration process or the device description update process. ScsiUnitRichDescription is a caller-allocated version of this structure.
