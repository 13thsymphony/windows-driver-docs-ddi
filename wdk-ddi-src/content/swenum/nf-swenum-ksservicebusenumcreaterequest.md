# KsServiceBusEnumCreateRequest function
<i>This function is intended for internal use only.</i>

The <b>KsServiceBusEnumCreateRequest</b> function services IRP_MJ_CREATE requests for the software bus device interface.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS KsServiceBusEnumCreateRequest(
  _In_    PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject,
  _Inout_ PIRP           Irp
);
````

## Parameters

`DeviceObject`

Pointer to the device object.

`Irp`

Pointer to the IRP that is associated with the device object.


## Return Value

Returns STATUS_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise. it returns STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND if the IRP's <i>FileObject-&gt;FileName</i> is <b>NULL</b> or if the reference string cannot be located. Otherwise, an appropriate error returns.

## Remarks

<b>KsServiceBusEnumCreateRequest</b> services the IRP_MJ_CREATE request for the registered device interface by matching the given IRP's<i> FileObject-&gt;FileName</i> with the registered bus reference strings. If the device reference is present, enumerated and created, the IRP is simply re-routed to the actual device. If the reference string is <b>NULL</b>, it is assumed that this is a request for the bus interface and the IRP_MJ_CREATE is completed. If the device reference has not already been enumerated, or is not active, the IRP is queued and a PDO is created and a bus enumeration is initiated by IoInvalidateDeviceRelations().
