# KsCreateBusEnumObject function
<i>This function is intended for internal use only.</i>

The <b>KsCreateBusEnumObject</b> function creates a demand-load bus enumerator object and initializes it for use with the demand-load bus enumerator services.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS KsCreateBusEnumObject(
  _In_     PWSTR          BusIdentifier,
  _In_     PDEVICE_OBJECT BusDeviceObject,
  _In_     PDEVICE_OBJECT PhysicalDeviceObject,
  _In_opt_ PDEVICE_OBJECT PnpDeviceObject,
  _In_opt_ REFGUID        InterfaceGuid,
  _In_opt_ PWSTR          ServiceRelativePath
);
````

## Parameters

`BusIdentifier`

Pointer to a wide-charachter string prefix identifier for the bus, such as L"SW" or L"KSDSP". This prefix is used to create the unique hardware identifier for the device, such as: SW\{xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx}.

`BusDeviceObject`

Pointer to the FDO for the bus. The device object must have been previously created and must have been attached to the PDO for the device.

`PhysicalDeviceObject`

Pointer to the Plug and Play-supplied PDO for the device.

`PnpDeviceObject`

Pointer to the driver stack to forward Plug and Play IRPs to. This parameter is optional. If this parameter is not specified, then the device object pointed to by the <i>BusDeviceObject</i> parameter is attached to the device object pointed to by the <i>PhysicalDeviceObject</i> parameter, and the resulting device object from that operation is used to forward IRPs.

`InterfaceGuid`

Specifies the interface GUID with which the demand-load bus enumeration object is associated. This parameter associates the bus with a device interface that is enumerable through <i>IoXxx</i> or <i>SetupApi</i> functions for device interfaces. This allows a driver to expose an interface with which either user-mode or kernel-mode clients can register new demand-load devices.

`ServiceRelativePath`

Pointer to a path to store a hierarchy of interfaces and device identifiers. This parameter is optional. For example, "Devices" will store the list of supported interfaces and devices in a path relative to the services key for this bus, such as:

REGISTRY\MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SWENUM\Devices.


## Return Value

Returns STATUS_SUCCESS if successful, or a memory error if unsuccessful.

## Remarks

The demand-load bus enumerator object extends a Plug and Play device by servicing bus enumerator queries through the <b>KsServiceBusEnumPnpRequest</b> function for the given functional device object.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  : The first PVOID of the device extension of the FDO pointed to in <i>BusDeviceObject</i> must be reserved for the resultant demand-load bus enumerator object.</div><div> </div>
