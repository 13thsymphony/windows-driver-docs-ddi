# WdfCommonBufferGetAlignedLogicalAddress function
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF only]

The <b>WdfCommonBufferGetAlignedLogicalAddress</b> method returns the logical address that is associated with a specified common buffer.

## Syntax

````
PHYSICAL_ADDRESS WdfCommonBufferGetAlignedLogicalAddress(
  _In_ WDFCOMMONBUFFER CommonBuffer
);
````

## Parameters

`CommonBuffer`

A handle to a common buffer object that the driver obtained by a previous call to <a href="..\wdfcommonbuffer\nf-wdfcommonbuffer-wdfcommonbuffercreate.md">WdfCommonBufferCreate</a>.


## Return Value

<b>WdfCommonBufferGetAlignedLogicalAddress</b> returns the logical address of the buffer that is associated with the common buffer that the <i>CommonBuffer</i> parameter specifies.

A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.

## Remarks

Logical addresses are mapped addresses that devices use to access physical memory.

If the driver called <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicesetalignmentrequirement.md">WdfDeviceSetAlignmentRequirement</a> to set a buffer alignment requirement, the framework aligns the common buffer according to that alignment requirement.

For more information about common buffers, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/81a56f62-917e-4798-b2cc-6469c802fab8">Using Common Buffers</a>
