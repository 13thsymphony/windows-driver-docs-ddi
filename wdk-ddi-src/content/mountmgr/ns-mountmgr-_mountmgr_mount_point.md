# _MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINT structure
The MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINT structure is used by mount manager clients in conjunction with an <a href="..\mountmgr\ni-mountmgr-ioctl_mountmgr_query_points.md">IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_QUERY_POINTS</a> request to query the mount manager for all of the mount points (symbolic links) associated with a device. The mount manager responds by sending an array of MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINT structures containing the mount points.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINT {
  ULONG  SymbolicLinkNameOffset;
  USHORT SymbolicLinkNameLength;
  ULONG  UniqueIdOffset;
  USHORT UniqueIdLength;
  ULONG  DeviceNameOffset;
  USHORT DeviceNameLength;
} MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINT, *PMOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINT;
````

## Members


`DeviceNameLength`

Contains the length, in bytes, of the nonpersistent device name.

`DeviceNameOffset`

Contains an offset, in bytes, into the output buffer where the nonpersistent device name is located.

`Reserved1`



`Reserved2`



`Reserved3`



`SymbolicLinkNameLength`

Contains the length, in bytes, of the symbolic link.

`SymbolicLinkNameOffset`

Contains an offset, in bytes, into the output buffer where the symbolic link is located.

`UniqueIdLength`

Contains the length, in bytes, of the unique ID.

`UniqueIdOffset`

Contains an offset, in bytes, into the output buffer where the unique ID is located.

## Remarks
None of the names returned are <b>NULL</b> terminated, nor do the buffers require terminating <b>NULL</b> characters. The caller of <a href="..\mountmgr\ni-mountmgr-ioctl_mountmgr_query_points.md">IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_QUERY_POINTS</a> is not required to provide data in all of the members of the MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINT structure, but empty members must have an offset of zero.

On input, offsets are from the beginning of the MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINT structure. On output offsets are from the beginning of the buffer. This is usually the same as the beginning of the <a href="..\mountmgr\ns-mountmgr-_mountmgr_mount_points.md">MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINTS</a> container structure (as opposed to the embedded MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINT array instance).

The <a href="..\mountmgr\ni-mountmgr-ioctl_mountmgr_query_points.md">IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_QUERY_POINTS</a> request is available in Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For a discussion of the different between symbolic links, unique IDs, and nonpersistent device names, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fb37f862-70d6-4514-b481-16f664346422">Supporting Mount Manager Requests in a Storage Class Driver</a>.
