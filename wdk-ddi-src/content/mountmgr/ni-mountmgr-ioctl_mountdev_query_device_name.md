# IOCTL_MOUNTDEV_QUERY_DEVICE_NAME IOCTL
Support for this IOCTL by the mount manager clients is mandatory. Upon receiving this IOCTL a client driver must provide the (nonpersistent) device (or target) name for the volume. The mount manager uses the <i>device name</i> returned by the client as the target of a symbolic link. An example of a device name would be "\Device\HarddiskVolume1".

### Major Code
[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](xref:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control")

### Input Buffer
<text></text>

### Input Buffer Length
<text></text>

### Output Buffer
The mount manager client returns a variable-length structure of type <a href="..\mountmgr\ns-mountmgr-_mountdev_name.md">MOUNTDEV_NAME</a>, defined in <i>Mountmgr.h</i>, at the beginning of the buffer at <b>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b>. The device name must be inserted at the address pointed to by the <i>Name</i> member of this structure.

### Output Buffer Length
<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.OutputBufferLength</b> in the I/O stack location of the IRP indicates the size, in bytes, of the output buffer, which must be greater than or equal to <b>sizeof</b>(MOUNTDEV_NAME).

### Input / Output Buffer
<text></text>

### Input / Output Buffer Length
<text></text>

### Status Block
The <b>Information</b> field is set to FIELD_OFFSET(<a href="..\mountmgr\ns-mountmgr-_mountdev_name.md">MOUNTDEV_NAME</a>, Name) + output-&gt;NameLength, or alternatively, output-&gt;NameLength + sizeof(USHORT), where output points to the buffer at <b>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b>

If the operation is successful, the mount manager client must set the <b>Information</b> field to the length of the <b>NULL</b>-terminated string containing the device name and the <b>Status</b> field to STATUS_SUCCESS. 

If the output buffer is too small to hold the device name, the mount manager client must set the <b>Information</b> field to <b>sizeof</b>(MOUNTDEV_NAME) and the <b>Status</b> field to STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW. In addition, the mount manager client fills in the NameLength member of the <a href="..\mountmgr\ns-mountmgr-_mountdev_name.md">MOUNTDEV_NAME</a> structure.
