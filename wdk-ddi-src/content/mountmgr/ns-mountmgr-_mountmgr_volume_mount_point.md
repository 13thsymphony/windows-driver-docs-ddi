# _MOUNTMGR_VOLUME_MOUNT_POINT structure
The MOUNTMGR_VOLUME_MOUNT_POINT structure is used in conjunction with the <a href="..\mountmgr\ni-mountmgr-ioctl_mountmgr_volume_mount_point_created.md">IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_VOLUME_MOUNT_POINT_CREATED</a> request to inform the mount manager that a volume mount point has been created.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _MOUNTMGR_VOLUME_MOUNT_POINT {
  USHORT SourceVolumeNameOffset;
  USHORT SourceVolumeNameLength;
  USHORT TargetVolumeNameOffset;
  USHORT TargetVolumeNameLength;
} MOUNTMGR_VOLUME_MOUNT_POINT, *PMOUNTMGR_VOLUME_MOUNT_POINT;
````

## Members


`SourceVolumeNameLength`

Contains the length, in bytes, of the mount point name.

`SourceVolumeNameOffset`

Contains an offset, in bytes, into the output buffer where the name of the mount point is located.

`TargetVolumeNameLength`

Contains the length, in bytes, of the target name.

`TargetVolumeNameOffset`

Contains an offset, in bytes, into the output buffer where the unique (persistent) volume name of the target device is located.

## Remarks
Mount point names must contain the full path of a mount point object name in the system object tree. For example: "\DosDevices\E:\FilesysD\mnt". For an explanation of unique volume names and how the mount manager uses them, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fb37f862-70d6-4514-b481-16f664346422">Supporting Mount Manager Requests in a Storage Class Driver</a>.
