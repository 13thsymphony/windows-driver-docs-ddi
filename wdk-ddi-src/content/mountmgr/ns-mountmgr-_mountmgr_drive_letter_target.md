# _MOUNTMGR_DRIVE_LETTER_TARGET structure
The MOUNTMGR_DRIVE_LETTER_TARGET structure is used by a mount manager client with an <a href="..\mountmgr\ni-mountmgr-ioctl_mountmgr_next_drive_letter.md">IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_NEXT_DRIVE_LETTER</a> request to furnish a nonpersistent target device name to the mount manager.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _MOUNTMGR_DRIVE_LETTER_TARGET {
  USHORT DeviceNameLength;
  WCHAR  DeviceName[1];
} MOUNTMGR_DRIVE_LETTER_TARGET, *PMOUNTMGR_DRIVE_LETTER_TARGET;
````

## Members


`DeviceName`

Contains the nonpersistent target device name.

`DeviceNameLength`

Contains the length, in bytes, of device name.

## Remarks
The mount manager responds to the IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_NEXT_DRIVE_LETTER request by furnishing the client with a drive letter for the target device. 

Nonpersistent target names must contain the full path of a target object name in the system object tree. For example: "\Device\HarddiskVolume1". For a discussion of the difference between drive letters and nonpersistent target device names, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fb37f862-70d6-4514-b481-16f664346422">Supporting Mount Manager Requests in a Storage Class Driver</a>.
