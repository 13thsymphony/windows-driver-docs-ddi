# _MOUNTMGR_CREATE_POINT_INPUT structure



## -description
The MOUNTMGR_CREATE_POINT_INPUT structure is used by the mount manager to send a symbolic link name to a client that has requested symbolic link name by means of an <a href="..\mountmgr\ni-mountmgr-ioctl_mountmgr_create_point.md">IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_CREATE_POINT</a> request. 



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _MOUNTMGR_CREATE_POINT_INPUT {
  USHORT SymbolicLinkNameOffset;
  USHORT SymbolicLinkNameLength;
  USHORT DeviceNameOffset;
  USHORT DeviceNameLength;
} MOUNTMGR_CREATE_POINT_INPUT, *PMOUNTMGR_CREATE_POINT_INPUT;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field SymbolicLinkNameOffset

Contains an offset in bytes into the output buffer where the symbolic link name is located. 


### -field SymbolicLinkNameLength

Contains the length in bytes of the symbolic link name stored in the output buffer. 


### -field DeviceNameOffset

Contains an offset in bytes into the output buffer where the nonpersistent (target) device name is located. 


### -field DeviceNameLength

Contains the length in bytes of the nonpersistent (target) device name. 


## -remarks
The name given for purposes of identifying the volume can be of any type: a unique volume name, a symbolic link name, or a nonpersistent device name. For a discussion of the difference between symbolic link names and nonpersistent target device names, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fb37f862-70d6-4514-b481-16f664346422">Supporting Mount Manager Requests in a Storage Class Driver</a>.
