# IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_CHANGE_NOTIFY IOCTL
Clients send this IOCTL to the mount manager to be informed whenever there is a change in the mount manager's persistent symbolic link name database. 

The mount manager maintains a counter called <i>EpicNumber</i> that records how many changes have occurred in its persistent name database since the last startup. Clients send a number to the mount manager with every change notification request IRP, and the mount manager responds in the following manner:
<ul>
<li>
If the number supplied by the client is not equal to <i>EpicNumber</i>, the mount manager returns STATUS_SUCCESS, indicating that changes have occurred since the client last compared its number with the mount manager's <i>EpicNumber</i>. 

</li>
<li>
If the number supplied by the client is equal to <i>EpicNumber</i>, the mount manager interprets this as a request to be informed of the next change to the persistent name database, and it queues the change notification IRP and returns STATUS_PENDING. Whenever a change occurs in the database, the mount manager completes all of the pending change notification IRPs, thereby informing clients of the change.

</li>
</ul>A client that only wants to be informed of the changes to a particular volume is advised to register for Plug and Play target device notification and watch for GUID_IO_VOLUME_NAME_CHANGE.

### Major Code
[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](xref:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control")

### Input Buffer
The mount manager client initializes the <a href="..\mountmgr\ns-mountmgr-_mountmgr_change_notify_info.md">MOUNTMGR_CHANGE_NOTIFY_INFO</a> structure, defined in <i>Mountmgr.h</i>, at the beginning of the buffer at <b>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b>.

### Input Buffer Length
<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> in the I/O stack location of the IRP indicates the size, in bytes, of the input buffer, which must be greater than or equal to <b>sizeof</b>(MOUNTMGR_CHANGE_NOTIFY_INFO).

### Output Buffer
The mount manager returns the current <i>EpicNumber</i> in the <a href="..\mountmgr\ns-mountmgr-_mountmgr_change_notify_info.md">MOUNTMGR_CHANGE_NOTIFY_INFO</a> structure, defined in <i>Mountmgr.h</i>, at the beginning of the buffer at <b>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b>.

### Status Block
If the operation is successful, the <b>Status</b> field is set to STATUS_SUCCESS and the <b>Information</b> field is set to <b>sizeof</b>(MOUNTMGR_CHANGE_NOTIFY_INFO).

If <b>InputBufferLength</b> is less than <b>sizeof</b>(MOUNTMGR_CHANGE_NOTIFY_INFO) or <b>OutputBufferLength</b> is less than <b>sizeof</b>(MOUNTMGR_CHANGE_NOTIFY_INFO), the <b>Status</b> field is set to STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.
