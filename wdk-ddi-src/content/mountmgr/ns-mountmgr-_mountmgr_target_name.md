# _MOUNTMGR_TARGET_NAME structure
The MOUNTMGR_TARGET_NAME structure contains the nonpersistent target device name for a device and is used by mount manager clients with the  <a href="..\mountmgr\ni-mountmgr-ioctl_mountmgr_keep_links_when_offline.md">IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_KEEP_LINKS_WHEN_OFFLINE</a> request to tell the mount manager to keep the symbolic link for a device active even after the device has gone offline.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _MOUNTMGR_TARGET_NAME {
  USHORT DeviceNameLength;
  WCHAR  DeviceName[1];
} MOUNTMGR_TARGET_NAME, *PMOUNTMGR_TARGET_NAME;
````

## Members


`DeviceName`

Contains the nonpersistent target device name.

`DeviceNameLength`

Contains the length, in bytes, of the device name stored in <b>DeviceName</b>.

## Remarks
Nonpersistent target names must contain the full path of a target object name in the system object tree. For example: "\Device\HarddiskVolume1". For a discussion of the different between symbolic links, unique IDs, and nonpersistent device names, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fb37f862-70d6-4514-b481-16f664346422">Supporting Mount Manager Requests in a Storage Class Driver</a>.

| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows Driver kit version** |  |
