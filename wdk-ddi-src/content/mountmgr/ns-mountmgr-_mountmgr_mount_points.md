# _MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINTS structure
The MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINTS structure is used by mount manager to send a client the list of mount points associated with a device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINTS {
  ULONG                Size;
  ULONG                NumberOfMountPoints;
  MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINT MountPoints[1];
} MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINTS, *PMOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINTS;
````

## Members

`NumberOfMountPoints`

Contains the number of mount points that the mount manager is returning.

`Size`
