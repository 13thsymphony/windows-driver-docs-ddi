# ExtRemoteData::GetPtr method



## -description
<p>The <b>GetPtr</b> method returns a pointer from the target's memory version of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544008">ExtRemoteData</a> object, which represents the contents of the target's memory. The size of the unsigned integer from the target is the same size as a pointer on the target.</p>


## -syntax

````
ULONG64 GetPtr();
````


## -parameters


## -returns
<p><b>GetPtr</b> returns a pointer from the target's memory.  As with all pointers, if the target uses 32-bit pointers, it is sign-extended to 64-bits.</p>

## -remarks
<p>The size of the memory represented by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544008">ExtRemoteData</a> object must be the same as the size of a pointer on the target, <code>ExtExtension::m_PtrSize</code>.</p>
