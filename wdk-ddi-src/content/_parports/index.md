# Parallel Ports


Overview of the Parallel Ports technology.

To develop Parallel Ports, you need these headers:

 * [ntddpar.h](..\ntddpar\index.md)
 * [ntddser.h](..\ntddser\index.md)
 * [parallel.h](..\parallel\index.md)

For the programming guide, see [Parallel Ports](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/parports).

This section describes the client interface that the system-supplied parallel drivers provide for operating parallel ports and devices attached to parallel ports. In particular, vendor-supplied parallel drivers use this interface to operate parallel devices attached to parallel ports.
