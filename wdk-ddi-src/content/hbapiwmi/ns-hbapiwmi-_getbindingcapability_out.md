# _GetBindingCapability_OUT structure
The GetBindingCapability_OUT structure is used by a WMI provider to report the output parameter data of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553902">GetBindingCapability</a> WMI method to the WMI client.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _GetBindingCapability_OUT {
  ULONG HBAStatus;
  ULONG BindType;
} GetBindingCapability_OUT, *PGetBindingCapability_OUT;
````

## Members


`BindType`

Indicates the ability of an HBA and its miniport driver to provide a specific set of features related to persistent binding. For a list of values that this parameter can have, see the description of the HBA_BIND_TYPE WMI class qualifier.

`HBAStatus`

Contains the status of the operation. For a list of allowed values and their descriptions, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557233">HBA_STATUS</a>.

## Remarks
The WMI tool suite generates a declaration of the GetBindingCapability_OUT structure in <i>Hbapiwmi.h </i>when it compiles the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff562509">MSFC_HBAFCPInfo WMI Class</a>.
