The GetBindingCapability_OUT structure is used by a WMI provider to report the output parameter data of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553902">GetBindingCapability</a> WMI method to the WMI client.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _GetBindingCapability_OUT {
  ULONG HBAStatus;
  ULONG BindType;
} GetBindingCapability_OUT, *PGetBindingCapability_OUT;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field HBAStatus
