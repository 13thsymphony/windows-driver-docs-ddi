# _ScsiReadCapacity_IN structure
The ScsiReadCapacity_IN structure is used to deliver input parameter data to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564890">ScsiReadCapacity</a> WMI method.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _ScsiReadCapacity_IN {
  UCHAR     Cdb[6];
  UCHAR     HbaPortWWN[8];
  UCHAR     DiscoveredPortWWN[8];
  ULONGLONG FcLun;
} ScsiReadCapacity_IN, *PScsiReadCapacity_IN;
````

## Members


`Cdb`

Contains the command descriptor block that holds the SCSI read capacity command to be sent to the target device.

`DiscoveredPortWWN`

Contains a worldwide name for the port through which the target device is accessed.

`FcLun`

Indicates the logical unit number of the logical unit that will receive the SCSI read capacity command.

`HbaPortWWN`

Contains a worldwise name for the HBA through which the target is accessed.

## Remarks
The WMI tool suite generates a declaration of the ScsiReadCapacity_IN structure in <i>Hbapiwmi.h </i>when it compiles the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff562506">MSFC_HBAAdapterMethods WMI Class</a>.
