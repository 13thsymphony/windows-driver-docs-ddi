# _MS_SMHBA_SAS_Port structure



## -description
The MS_SMHBA_SAS_Port structure is used to report the SAS port information.


## -syntax

````
typedef struct _MS_SMHBA_SAS_Port {
  ULONG PortProtocol;
  UCHAR LocalSASAddress[8];
  UCHAR AttachedSASAddress[8];
  ULONG NumberofDiscoveredPorts;
  ULONG NumberofPhys;
} MS_SMHBA_SAS_Port, *PMS_SMHBA_SAS_Port;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field PortProtocol

The protocols that are supported by this SAS port.

### -field LocalSASAddress

The Port_Identifier of this SAS port

### -field AttachedSASAddress

The SAS address of the entity that is at the opposite end of the SAS link from this local SAS port.

### -field NumberofDiscoveredPorts

The number of end ports that are visible to the local SAS port. The discovered ports might also include SMP ports that are contained within SAS expander devices.

### -field NumberofPhys

The number of physical ports that are associated with this SAS port. If the value is more than one, this SAS port is considered to be a wide port.
