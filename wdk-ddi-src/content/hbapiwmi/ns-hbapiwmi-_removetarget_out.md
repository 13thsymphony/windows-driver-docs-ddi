# _RemoveTarget_OUT structure
The RemoveTarget_OUT structure is used by an HBA miniport driver to report the output parameter data of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564030">RemoveTarget</a> WMI method to the WMI client.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _RemoveTarget_OUT {
  ULONG HBAStatus;
} RemoveTarget_OUT, *PRemoveTarget_OUT;
````

## Members


`HBAStatus`

Contains the status of the operation. For a list of allowed values and their descriptions, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557233">HBA_STATUS</a>.

## Remarks
The WMI tool suite generates a declaration of the RemoveTarget_OUT structure in <i>Hbapiwmi.h </i>when it compiles the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff562490">MSFC_EventControl WMI Class</a>.
