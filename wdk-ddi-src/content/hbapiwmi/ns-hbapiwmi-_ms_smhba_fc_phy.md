# _MS_SMHBA_FC_PHY structure



## -description
The MS_SMHBA_FC_PHY structure is used to report the physical attributes of a fibre channel port.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _MS_SMHBA_FC_PHY {
  ULONG PhySupportSpeed;
  ULONG PhySpeed;
  UCHAR PhyType;
  ULONG MaxFrameSize;
} MS_SMHBA_FC_PHY, *PMS_SMHBA_FC_PHY;

## -struct-fields

### -field PhySupportSpeed

The signaling bit rates at which the port can operate. For a list of the values that this member supports, see PhySpeed.


### -field PhySpeed
