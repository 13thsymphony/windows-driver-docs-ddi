# _HBAFCPBindingEntry2 structure



## -description
The HBAFCPBindingEntry2 structure defines a binding between the information that uniquely identifies a logical unit for the operating system and the fibre channel protocol (FCP) identifier for the logical unit.


## -syntax

````
typedef struct _HBAFCPBindingEntry2 {
  ULONG     Type;
  HBAFCPID  FCPId;
  UCHAR     Luid[256];
  HBAScsiID ScsiId;
} HBAFCPBindingEntry2, *PHBAFCPBindingEntry2;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Type

Indicates the binding type. For a description of the values that this member can have, see the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API</i> specification. 
<table>
<tr>
<th>Type Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
HBA_BIND_TO_D_ID
</td>
<td>
Indicates that the target is identified by its fibre channel protocol (FCP) ID. The <b>Fcid</b> member of the <a href="storage.hbafcpid">HBAFCPID</a> structure contains this value.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
HBA_BIND_TO_WWPN
</td>
<td>
Indicates that the target is identified by its worldwide port name. The <b>PortWWN</b> member of the <a href="storage.hbafcpid">HBAFCPID</a> structure contains this value.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
HBA_BIND_TO_WWNN
</td>
<td>
Indicates that the fibre channel target device is identified by its worldwide node name. The <b>NodeWWN</b> member of the <a href="storage.hbafcpid">HBAFCPID</a> structure contains this value.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
HBA_BIND_TO_LUID
</td>
<td>
Indicates that the target is identified by its fibre channel logical unit ID. The <b>FcpLun</b> member of the <a href="storage.hbafcpid">HBAFCPID</a> structure contains this value.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
HBA_BIND_TARGETS
</td>
<td>
Indicates that the system should automatically generate target mappings from logical unit numbers to fibre channel protocol identifiers. 
</td>
</tr>
</table>
 
For information about what needs to be included to use the symbols that represent the binding types, see the Headers section.

### -field FCPId

Contains a structure of type <a href="storage.hbafcpid">HBAFCPID</a> that contains the FCP identifier for the logical unit and information about the port to be queried for information about the device.

### -field Luid[256]

Contains the logical unit descriptor for the device that the operating system derives from SCSI inquiry data. 

### -field ScsiId

Contains a structure of type <a href="storage.hbascsiid">HBAScsiID</a> that contains the information that uniquely identifies a logical unit for the operating system.

## -remarks
This structure is very similar to the <a href="storage.hbafcpbindingentry">HBAFCPBindingEntry</a> structure. The only difference is that HBAFCPBindingEntry2 includes the number that the operating system generates for the logical unit. 

The WMI tool suite generates a declaration of HBAFCPBindingEntry2 automatically when it compiles the <a href="storage.hbafcpbindingentry_wmi_class">HBAFCPBindingEntry WMI Class</a> that is defined in <i>hbaapi.mof</i>. 

For an explanation of the fibre channel protocol (FCP), see the T11 committee's <i>dpANS Fibre Channel Protocol for SCSI</i> specification.
