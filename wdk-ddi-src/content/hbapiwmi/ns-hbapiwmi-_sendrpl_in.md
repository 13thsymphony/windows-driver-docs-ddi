# _SendRPL_IN structure
The SendRPL_IN structure is used to deliver input parameter data to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565488">SendRPL</a> WMI method.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _SendRPL_IN {
  UCHAR PortWWN[8];
  UCHAR AgentWWN[8];
  ULONG agent_domain;
  ULONG portIndex;
} SendRPL_IN, *PSendRPL_IN;
````

## Members


`agent_domain`

Contains the domain number for the domain controller that is to be queried for a list of ports of type FC_Port. For a definition of FC_Port, see the T11 committee's specification for <i>Fibre Channel HBA API</i>.

`AgentWWN`

Contains a worldwide name for the port that is to be queried for a list of ports of type FC_Port. For a definition of FC_Port, see the T11 committee's specification for <i>Fibre Channel HBA API</i>.

`portIndex`

Contains the port index of the first port in the list of ports of type FC_Port to be returned.

`PortWWN`

Contains a worldwide name for the local port through which the read port list (RPL) command is sent.

## Remarks
The WMI tool suite generates a declaration of the SendRPL_IN structure in <i>Hbapiwmi.h </i>when it compiles the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff562506">MSFC_HBAAdapterMethods WMI Class</a>.
