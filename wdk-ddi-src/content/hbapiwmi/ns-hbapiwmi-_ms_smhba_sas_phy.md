# _MS_SMHBA_SAS_PHY structure



## -description
The MS_SMHBA_SAS_PHY structure is used to report the SAS physical port information.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _MS_SMHBA_SAS_PHY {
  UCHAR PhyIdentifier;
  ULONG NegotiatedLinkRate;
  ULONG ProgrammedMinLinkRate;
  ULONG HardwareMinLinkRate;
  ULONG ProgrammedMaxLinkRate;
  ULONG HardwareMaxLinkRate;
  UCHAR domainPortWWN[8];
} MS_SMHBA_SAS_PHY, *PMS_SMHBA_SAS_PHY;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field PhyIdentifier

The port whose physical configuration and link information is being returned. It is unique within the context of the SAS device that contains the physical port.


### -field NegotiatedLinkRate

The state or the transmission speed that is negotiated by the physical port for the physical link.


### -field ProgrammedMinLinkRate

The minimum physical link rate that is set by the physical port control mechanism.


### -field HardwareMinLinkRate

The minimum physical link rate that is supported by the physical port.


### -field ProgrammedMaxLinkRate

The maximum physical link rate that is set by the physical port control mechanism.


### -field HardwareMaxLinkRate

The maximum physical link rate that is supported by the physical port.


### -field domainPortWWN

The Port_Identifier that has the smallest value of any Port_Identifier of an expander SMP.


## -remarks
Link rates are defined in hpaapi.h as HBA_SASSPEED_1_5GBIT and HBA_SASSPEED_3GBIT.</p>
