# _SM_GetBindingCapability_OUT structure
The SM_GetBindingCapability_OUT structure is used to receive output parameters from the SM_GetBindingCapability method.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _SM_GetBindingCapability_OUT {
  ULONG HBAStatus;
  ULONG Flags;
} SM_GetBindingCapability_OUT, *PSM_GetBindingCapability_OUT;
````

## Members

        
            `Flags`

            The HBA_BIND_CAPABILITY binding capabilities.
        
            `HBAStatus`

            The status of the operation. For a list of allowed values and their descriptions, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557233">HBA_STATUS</a>.

    ## Remarks
        The WMI tool suite generates a declaration of the SM_GetBindingCapability_OUT structure in <i>Hbapiwmi.h</i> when it compiles the MS_SM_TargetInformationMethods WMI class.</p>
