# _HBAFC3MgmtInfo structure
The HBAFC3MgmtInfo structure is used to report FC3 management information associated with a fibre channel adapter.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _HBAFC3MgmtInfo {
  ULONGLONG UniqueAdapterId;
  UCHAR     wwn[8];
  ULONG     unittype;
  ULONG     PortId;
  ULONG     NumberOfAttachedNodes;
  USHORT    IPVersion;
  USHORT    UDPPort;
  UCHAR     IPAddress[16];
  USHORT    reserved;
  USHORT    TopologyDiscoveryFlags;
  ULONG     reserved1;
} HBAFC3MgmtInfo, *PHBAFC3MgmtInfo;
````

## Members


`IPAddress`

Indicates the value of the IP address field of the specific identification data as described in the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API </i>specification.

`IPVersion`

Contains the concatenated node management and IP version fields of the specific identification data as described in the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API </i>specification.

`NumberOfAttachedNodes`

Contains the number of nodes attached to the topology as described in the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API </i>specification.

`PortId`

Contains a value corresponding to the physical port number field of the specific identification data as described in the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API </i>specification.

`reserved`

Reserved.

`reserved1`

Reserved.

`TopologyDiscoveryFlags`

Indicates the value of the vendor specific field in word 12 of the specific identification data as described in the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API </i>specification.

`UDPPort`

Indicates the value of the UDP/TCP port number field of the specific identification data as described in the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API </i>specification.

`UniqueAdapterId`

Contains a unique identifier for the adapter.

`unittype`

Describes the type of HBA, as described in the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API </i>specification.

`wwn`

Contains a worldwide name for the adapter, as described in the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API </i>specification.

## Remarks
FC-3 refers to the common services layer of the fibre channel protocol. It defines a set of services which are common across multiple ports of a node. For an explanation of the common services layer, see the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API</i> specification.

The WMI tool suite generates a declaration of this structure automatically when it compiles the <b>HBAFC3MgmtInfo</b> WMI Class in <i>hbaapi.mof</i>.
