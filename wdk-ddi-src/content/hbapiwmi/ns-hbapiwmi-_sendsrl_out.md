# _SendSRL_OUT structure
The SendSRL_OUT structure is used to report the output parameter data of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565522">SendSRL</a> WMI method to the WMI client.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _SendSRL_OUT {
  ULONG HBAStatus;
  ULONG TotalRspBufferSize;
  ULONG ActualRspBufferSize;
  UCHAR RspBuffer[1];
} SendSRL_OUT, *PSendSRL_OUT;
````

## Members


`ActualRspBufferSize`

Contains the size in bytes of the data that was actually retrieved.

`HBAStatus`

Contains the status of the operation. For a list of allowed values and their descriptions, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557233">HBA_STATUS</a>.

`RspBuffer`

Contains the results of the SRL command.

`TotalRspBufferSize`

Contains the size in bytes of the results of the SRL command.

## Remarks
The WMI tool suite generates a declaration of the SendSRL_OUT structure in <i>Hbapiwmi.h </i>when it compiles the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff562506">MSFC_HBAAdapterMethods WMI Class</a>.
