# _ScsiReadCapacity_OUT structure
The ScsiReadCapacity_OUT structure is used to report the output data of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564890">ScsiReadCapacity</a> WMI method to the WMI client.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _ScsiReadCapacity_OUT {
  ULONG HBAStatus;
  ULONG ResponseBufferSize;
  ULONG SenseBufferSize;
  UCHAR ScsiStatus;
  UCHAR ResponseBuffer[1];
  UCHAR SenseBuffer[1];
} ScsiReadCapacity_OUT, *PScsiReadCapacity_OUT;
````

## Members


`HBAStatus`

Contains a value associated with the WMI class qualifier <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557233">HBA_STATUS</a> that indicates the result of an HBA query operation.

`ResponseBuffer`

Contains the results of the SCSI read capacity command.

`ResponseBufferSize`

Indicates the size in bytes of the buffer that will hold the results of the read capacity command.

`ScsiStatus`

Contains the status of the SCSI read capacity command.

`SenseBufferSize`

Indicates the size in bytes of the buffer that will hold the SCSI sense data that results from the read capacity command.

## Remarks
The WMI tool suite generates a declaration of the ScsiReadCapacity_OUT structure in <i>Hbapiwmi.h </i>when it compiles the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff562506">MSFC_HBAAdapterMethods WMI Class</a>.
