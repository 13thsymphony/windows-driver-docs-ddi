# _AddTarget_IN structure
The AddPort_IN structure is used by a WMI client to deliver the input parameter data of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550136">AddTarget</a> WMI method to the HBA miniport driver.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _AddTarget_IN {
  UCHAR HbaPortWWN[8];
  UCHAR DiscoveredPortWWN[8];
  ULONG AllTargets;
} AddTarget_IN, *PAddTarget_IN;
````

## Members

        
            `AllTargets`

            Indicates the scope of the target events to report. If this member is zero, the WMI client will receive events associated with the port that is indicated by <i>DiscoveredPortWWN</i>. If this member is nonzero, the WMI client will all events associated with all currently discovered targets as well as targets that are discovered in the future.
        
            `DiscoveredPortWWN`

            Contains a worldwide name that specifies the discovered target whose events the WMI client will receive.
        
            `HbaPortWWN`

            Contains the worldwide name of the local port whose events the WMI client will receive.
