# _RemovePort_IN structure
The Remove_IN structure is used by a WMI client to deliver input parameter data to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564011">RemovePort</a> WMI method.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _RemovePort_IN {
  UCHAR PortWWN[8];
} RemovePort_IN, *PRemovePort_IN;
````

## Members


`PortWWN`

Contains a worldwide name that indicates the port that should be removed from the list of ports whose events are reported to the WMI client..

## Remarks
The WMI tool suite generates a declaration of the RemovePort_IN structure in <i>Hbapiwmi.h </i>when it compiles the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff562490">MSFC_EventControl WMI Class</a>.
