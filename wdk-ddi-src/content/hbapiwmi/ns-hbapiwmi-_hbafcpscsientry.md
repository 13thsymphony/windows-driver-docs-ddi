# _HBAFCPScsiEntry structure



## -description
The HBAFCPScsiEntry structure is used with <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554948">GetFcpTargetMapping</a> method of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff562509">MSFC_HBAFCPInfo WMI Class</a> to define a binding between the operating system information that uniquely identifies a logical unit and the fibre channel protocol (FCP) identifier that identifies the logical unit.  



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _HBAFCPScsiEntry {
  HBAFCPID  FCPId;
  UCHAR     Luid[256];
  HBAScsiID ScsiId;
} HBAFCPScsiEntry, *PHBAFCPScsiEntry;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field FCPId

Contains a structure of type <a href="..\hbapiwmi\ns-hbapiwmi-_hbafcpid.md">HBAFCPID</a> that contains the FCP identifier for the logical unit and information about the port to be queried for information about the device.


### -field Luid

Contains the logical unit descriptor for the device that the operating system derives from SCSI inquiry data. 


### -field ScsiId

Contains a structure of type <a href="..\hbapiwmi\ns-hbapiwmi-_hbascsiid.md">HBAScsiID</a> that contains the information that uniquely identifies a logical unit for the operating system.
