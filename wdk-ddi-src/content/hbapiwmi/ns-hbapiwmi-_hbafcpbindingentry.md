# _HBAFCPBindingEntry structure
The HBAFCPBindingEntry structure defines a binding between the information that uniquely identifies a logical unit for the operating system and the fibre channel protocol (FCP) identifier for the logical unit.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _HBAFCPBindingEntry {
  ULONG     Type;
  HBAFCPID  FCPId;
  HBAScsiID ScsiId;
} HBAFCPBindingEntry, *PHBAFCPBindingEntry;
````

## Members


`FCPId`

Contains a structure of type <a href="..\hbapiwmi\ns-hbapiwmi-_hbafcpid.md">HBAFCPID</a> that contains the FCP identifier for the logical unit and information about the port to be queried for information about the device.

`ScsiId`

Contains a structure of type <a href="..\hbapiwmi\ns-hbapiwmi-_hbascsiid.md">HBAScsiID</a> that contains the information that uniquely identifies a logical unit for the operating system.

`Type`

Contains a binding type that indicates how the target is specified in the binding. This member can have any of the following values:  

<table>
<tr>
<th>Type Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
HBA_BIND_TO_D_ID

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the target is identified by its fibre channel protocol (FCP) ID. The <b>Fcid</b> member of the <a href="..\hbapiwmi\ns-hbapiwmi-_hbafcpid.md">HBAFCPID</a> structure contains this value.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
HBA_BIND_TO_WWPN

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the target is identified by its worldwide port name. The <b>PortWWN</b> member of the <a href="..\hbapiwmi\ns-hbapiwmi-_hbafcpid.md">HBAFCPID</a> structure contains this value.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
HBA_BIND_TO_WWNN

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the fibre channel target device is identified by its worldwide node name. The <b>NodeWWN</b> member of the <a href="..\hbapiwmi\ns-hbapiwmi-_hbafcpid.md">HBAFCPID</a> structure contains this value.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
HBA_BIND_TO_LUID

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the target is identified by its fibre channel logical unit ID. The <b>FcpLun</b> member of the <a href="..\hbapiwmi\ns-hbapiwmi-_hbafcpid.md">HBAFCPID</a> structure contains this value.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
HBA_BIND_TARGETS

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the system should automatically generate target mappings from logical unit numbers to fibre channel protocol identifiers. 

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

You must include file <i>hbaapi.h </i>to use the symbolic constants in this table (See the <b>Headers</b> section).

For a comparable set of values that define how an HBA specifies targets and logical units in the persistent bindings that it maintains, see the WMI property qualifier <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556046">HBA_BIND_TYPE</a>. 

For a more detailed description of the values that this member can have, see the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API</i> specification.

## Remarks
The WMI tool suite generates a declaration of this structure automatically when it compiles the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556037">HBAFCPBindingEntry WMI Class</a> in <i>hbaapi.mof</i>. 

For an explanation of the fibre channel protocol (FCP), see the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel Protocol for SCSI</i> specification.
