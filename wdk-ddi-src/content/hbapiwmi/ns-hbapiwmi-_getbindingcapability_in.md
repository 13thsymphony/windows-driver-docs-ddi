# _GetBindingCapability_IN structure
The GetBindingCapability_IN structure is used by a WMI client to deliver the input parameter data of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553902">GetBindingCapability</a> WMI method to the HBA miniport driver.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _GetBindingCapability_IN {
  UCHAR PortWWN[8];
} GetBindingCapability_IN, *PGetBindingCapability_IN;
````

## Members


`PortWWN`

Contains a worldwide name that indicates the port whose persistent bindings are to be retrieved.

## Remarks
The WMI tool suite generates a declaration of the GetBindingCapability_IN structure in <i>Hbapiwmi.h </i>when it compiles the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff562509">MSFC_HBAFCPInfo WMI Class</a>.
