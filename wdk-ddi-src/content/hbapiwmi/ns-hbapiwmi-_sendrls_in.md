# _SendRLS_IN structure
The SendRLS_IN structure is used to deliver input parameter data to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565442">SendRLS</a> WMI method.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _SendRLS_IN {
  UCHAR PortWWN[8];
  UCHAR DestWWN[8];
} SendRLS_IN, *PSendRLS_IN;
````

## Members


`DestWWN`

Contains a worldwide name for the destination port.

`PortWWN`

Contains a worldwide name for the local port through which the read link error status block (RLS) command is sent.

## Remarks
The WMI tool suite generates a declaration of the SendRLS_IN structure in <i>Hbapiwmi.h </i>when it compiles the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff562506">MSFC_HBAAdapterMethods WMI Class</a>.

## Requirements
