# _SYNTHVOICEPRIORITY_INSTANCE structure
The SYNTHVOICEPRIORITY_INSTANCE structure identifies a voice in a MIDI synthesizer by specifying the voice's channel group (set of 16 MIDI channels) and its channel number within that group.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _SYNTHVOICEPRIORITY_INSTANCE {
  DWORD ChannelGroup;
  DWORD Channel;
} SYNTHVOICEPRIORITY_INSTANCE, *PSYNTHVOICEPRIORITY_INSTANCE;
````

## Members


`Channel`

Specifies the channel that the voice is on. This member contains a channel number in the range 0 through 15. It identifies a channel in the channel group.

`ChannelGroup`

Specifies the channel group that the voice belongs to. Channel groups are numbered beginning at zero. Each channel group contains 16 channels.

## Remarks
The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537407">KSPROPERTY_SYNTH_VOICEPRIORITY</a> property request uses the SYNTHVOICEPRIORITY_INSTANCE structure for its property descriptor. The structure specifies which voice gets priority when the miniport driver needs to bump voices from the cache.
