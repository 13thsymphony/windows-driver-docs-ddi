# _SYNTH_STATS structure
The SYNTH_STATS structure specifies synthesizer performance statistics such as the number of voices playing, CPU usage, number of notes lost, amount of free memory, and peak volume level.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _SYNTH_STATS {
  DWORD ValidStats;
  DWORD Voices;
  DWORD TotalCPU;
  DWORD CPUPerVoice;
  DWORD LostNotes;
  DWORD FreeMemory;
  LONG  PeakVolume;
} SYNTH_STATS, *PSYNTH_STATS;
````

## Members


`CPUPerVoice`

Specifies the CPU usage per voice, which is expressed as a percentage (a fraction multiplied by 100).

`FreeMemory`

Specifies the amount of free memory in bytes. This is the storage that remains available for downloading additional DLS data resources.

`LostNotes`

Specifies the number of notes lost. Notes can be dropped if the number of simultaneous voices exceeds the maximum specified by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537405">KSPROPERTY_SYNTH_PORTPARAMETERS</a> property. For additional information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fb1e6c36-02b4-41a6-b9c4-09f393d389db">Voice Allocation</a>.

`PeakVolume`

Specifies the peak volume level expressed as decibels multiplied by 100.

`TotalCPU`

Specifies the total CPU usage (all voices), which is expressed as a percentage (a fraction multiplied by 100).

`ValidStats`

Specifies which members of the SYNTH_STATS structure contain valid data. This member is a bitfield whose value is either zero or a bitwise OR of one or more of the following flag bits:





#### SYNTH_STATS_VOICES

The <b>Voices</b> field contains valid data.



#### SYNTH_STATS_TOTAL_CPU

The <b>TotalCPU</b> field contains valid data.



#### SYNTH_STATS_CPU_PER_VOICE

The <b>CPUPerVoice</b> field contains valid data.



#### SYNTH_STATS_LOST_NOTES

The <b>LostNotes </b>field contains valid data.



#### SYNTH_STATS_PEAK_VOLUME

The <b>PeakVolume </b>field contains valid data.



#### SYNTH_STATS_FREE_MEMORY

The <b>FreeMemory</b> field contains valid data.

`Voices`

Specifies the average number of voices playing.

## Remarks
The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537406">KSPROPERTY_SYNTH_RUNNINGSTATS</a> property uses the SYNTH_STATS structure to query a DirectMusic miniport driver for statistics about a synthesizer.

The SYNTH_STATS structure is similar to the DMUS_SYNTHSTATS structure, which is described in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.
