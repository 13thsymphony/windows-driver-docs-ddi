# _SYNTH_STATS structure



## -description
The SYNTH_STATS structure specifies synthesizer performance statistics such as the number of voices playing, CPU usage, number of notes lost, amount of free memory, and peak volume level.


## -syntax

````
typedef struct _SYNTH_STATS {
  DWORD ValidStats;
  DWORD Voices;
  DWORD TotalCPU;
  DWORD CPUPerVoice;
  DWORD LostNotes;
  DWORD FreeMemory;
  LONG  PeakVolume;
} SYNTH_STATS, *PSYNTH_STATS;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field ValidStats

Specifies which members of the SYNTH_STATS structure contain valid data. This member is a bitfield whose value is either zero or a bitwise OR of one or more of the following flag bits:


### -field SYNTH_STATS_VOICES

The <b>Voices</b> field contains valid data.

### -field SYNTH_STATS_TOTAL_CPU

The <b>TotalCPU</b> field contains valid data.

### -field SYNTH_STATS_CPU_PER_VOICE

The <b>CPUPerVoice</b> field contains valid data.

### -field SYNTH_STATS_LOST_NOTES

The <b>LostNotes </b>field contains valid data.

### -field SYNTH_STATS_PEAK_VOLUME

The <b>PeakVolume </b>field contains valid data.

### -field SYNTH_STATS_FREE_MEMORY

The <b>FreeMemory</b> field contains valid data.
</dd>
</dl>

### -field Voices

Specifies the average number of voices playing.

### -field TotalCPU

Specifies the total CPU usage (all voices), which is expressed as a percentage (a fraction multiplied by 100).

### -field CPUPerVoice

Specifies the CPU usage per voice, which is expressed as a percentage (a fraction multiplied by 100).

### -field LostNotes

Specifies the number of notes lost. Notes can be dropped if the number of simultaneous voices exceeds the maximum specified by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537405">KSPROPERTY_SYNTH_PORTPARAMETERS</a> property. For additional information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fb1e6c36-02b4-41a6-b9c4-09f393d389db">Voice Allocation</a>.

### -field FreeMemory

Specifies the amount of free memory in bytes. This is the storage that remains available for downloading additional DLS data resources.

### -field PeakVolume

Specifies the peak volume level expressed as decibels multiplied by 100.

## -remarks
The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537406">KSPROPERTY_SYNTH_RUNNINGSTATS</a> property uses the SYNTH_STATS structure to query a DirectMusic miniport driver for statistics about a synthesizer.

The SYNTH_STATS structure is similar to the DMUS_SYNTHSTATS structure, which is described in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.
