# USBFN_SET_DEVICE_STATE function



## -description
The filter driver's implementation to set the device state and operating bus speed.



## -syntax

````
USBFN_SET_DEVICE_STATE UsbFnSetDeviceState;

NTSTATUS UsbFnSetDeviceState(
  _In_ PVOID              Context,
  _In_ USBFN_DEVICE_STATE DeviceState,
  _In_ USBFN_BUS_SPEED    BusSpeed
)
{ ... }

typedef USBFN_SET_DEVICE_STATE PFN_USBFN_SET_DEVICE_STATE;
````


## -parameters

### -param Context [in]

    A pointer to a driver-defined context.


### -param DeviceState [in]

    A <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt187992">USBFN_DEVICE_STATE</a>-typed flag that indicates the state of the device.


### -param BusSpeed [in]

A <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt187987">USBFN_BUS_SPEED</a>-typed flag that indicates the bus speed.


## -returns
If the operation is successful, the callback function must return STATUS_SUCCESS, or another status value for which NT_SUCCESS(status) equals TRUE. Otherwise it must return a status value for which NT_SUCCESS(status) equals FALSE.


## -remarks
To support attach and detatch detection, the USB lower filter driver must publish its support. During the publishing process, the driver also registers its implementation of this  callback function. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/05D2B46A-282C-4B75-9F5C-2FC0AF344AB9">USB filter driver for supporting proprietary chargers</a>.

The lower filter driver might implement  a <i>USBFN_SET_DEVICE_STATE</i> even callback function if it requires notification of device state changes to properly configure charging when attached to a host, or in lab scenarios where charging via USB must be disabled.
