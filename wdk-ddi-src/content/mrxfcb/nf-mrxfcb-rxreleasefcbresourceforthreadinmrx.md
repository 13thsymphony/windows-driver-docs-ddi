# RxReleaseFcbResourceForThreadInMRx function



## -description
<b>RxReleaseFcbResourceForThreadInMRx</b> releases the FCB resource acquired by a network mini-redirector driver with a particular thread ID. 



## -syntax

````
VOID RxReleaseFcbResourceForThreadInMRx(
  _In_    PRX_CONTEXT      pRxContext,
  _Inout_ PMRX_FCB         MrxFcb,
  _In_    ERESOURCE_THREAD ResourceThreadId
);
````


## -parameters

### -param pRxContext [in]

A pointer to the RX_CONTEXT structure.


### -param MrxFcb [in, out]

A pointer to the FCB. This parameter is required and cannot be <b>NULL</b>. 


### -param ResourceThreadId [in]

The thread ID that originally acquired the resource.


## -returns
None 


## -remarks
The synchronization resources of interest to a network mini-redirector driver are primarily associated with the FCB. There is a paging I/O resource and a regular resource. The paging I/O resource is managed internally by RDBSS. The only resource accessible to a network mini-redirector driver is the regular resource. 

The <b>RxReleaseFcbResourceForThreadInMRx</b> routine will release an FCB resource previously acquired for a particular thread ID. This resource would have been acquired by calling <b>RxAcquireExclusiveFcbResourceInMRx</b>, <b>RxAcquireSharedFcbResourceInMRx</b>, or <b>RxAcquireSharedFcbResourceInMRxEx</b>. If there are any pending buffering state change requests for this FCB, then these buffering state changes will be processed first before the <b>RxReleaseFcbResourceForThreadInMRx</b> routine returns.
