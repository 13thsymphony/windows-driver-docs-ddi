# _GLYPHRUN structure
The GLYPHRUN structure is one of the structures used to define the contents of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6e643703-ace1-4660-990c-3a9ca735829d">glyph translation table files</a> (.gtt files).

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _GLYPHRUN {
  WCHAR wcLow;
  WORD  wGlyphCount;
} GLYPHRUN, *PGLYPHRUN;
````

## Members


`wcLow`

Specifies a Unicode value representing the first glyph in the glyph run.

`wGlyphCount`

Specifies the number of glyphs represented by the glyph run.

## Remarks
A .gtt (glyph translation table) file contains an array of GLYPHRUN structures. Each structure identifies a set of Unicode values for which the printer provides glyphs. The array is described by the <b>IoRunOffset</b> and <b>dwRunCount</b> members of a .gtt file's <a href="..\prntfont\ns-prntfont-_uni_glyphsetdata.md">UNI_GLYPHSETDATA</a> structure.

The GLYPHRUN structures must be defined in ascending order, based on the value of <b>wcLow</b>. Unidrv uses the GLYPHRUN array to generate glyph handles. Unidrv stores these glyph handles in a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff570578">WCRUN</a> array within an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565625">FD_GLYPHSET</a> structure.
