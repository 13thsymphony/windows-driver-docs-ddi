# IOCTL_SRIOV_QUERY_MITIGATED_RANGE_COUNT IOCTL



## -description
 The request determines the ranges of memory-mapped I/O space that must mitigated. 


## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
A pointer to a <a href="buses._sriov_mitigated_range_count_input">SRIOV_MITIGATED_RANGE_COUNT_INPUT</a> structure. Set the <b>VfIndex</b> member to 0. 

### -input-buffer-length
The size of the <a href="buses._sriov_mitigated_range_count_input">SRIOV_MITIGATED_RANGE_COUNT_INPUT</a> structure.

### -output-buffer
A pointer to a <a href="buses._sriov_mitigated_range_count_output">SRIOV_MITIGATED_RANGE_COUNT_OUTPUT</a> structure that is filled by the physical function (PF) driver with  ranges of memory-mapped I/O space. 

### -output-buffer-length
The size of the <a href="buses._sriov_mitigated_range_count_output">SRIOV_MITIGATED_RANGE_COUNT_OUTPUT</a> structure. 

### -in-out-buffer

<text></text>

### -inout-buffer-length

<text></text>

### -status-block
I/O Status block
TBD

<b>Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status</b> is set to STATUS_SUCCESS if the request is successful. Otherwise, <b>Status</b> to the appropriate error condition as a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7792201b-63bb-4db5-803d-2af02893d505">NTSTATUS</a> code. 

## -remarks
This IOCTL request is sent by the virtualization stack to the  PCI Express SR-IOV Physical Function (PF) driver that exposes GUID_DEVINTERFACE_VIRTUALIZABLE_DEVICE.

The virtualization stack uses an I/O MMU to differentiate traffic coming from the various interfaces that the device exposes, enforcing policy about which regions of memory a device can access and which interrupts it can generate. 

The request is sent to the physical function (PF) driver by the virtualization stack to find out the ranges of memory-mapped I/O space
in which the stack must place
intercepts  on those pages and send the requests to read and write values
within those pages to the PF driver.
