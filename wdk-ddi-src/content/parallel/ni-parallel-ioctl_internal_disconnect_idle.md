# IOCTL_INTERNAL_DISCONNECT_IDLE IOCTL
The <b>IOCTL_INTERNAL_DISCONNECT_IDLE</b> request disconnects the IEEE 1284 operating modes that are set for a parallel device. The system-supplied bus driver for parallel ports sets the default operating mode to IEEE 1284-compatible.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2ff53ed0-dbb7-4c8f-b6e4-5f7d20124a7c">Setting and Clearing a Communication Mode for a Parallel Device</a>.
