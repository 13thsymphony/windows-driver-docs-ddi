# PPARALLEL_READ callback



## -description
The PPARALLEL_READ-typed callback routine reads data from a parallel device. The system-supplied bus driver for parallel ports supplies this routine.



## -prototype

````
typedef NTSTATUS ( *PPARALLEL_READ)(
  _In_  PVOID  Context,
  _Out_ PVOID  Buffer,
  _In_  ULONG  NumBytesToRead,
  _Out_ PULONG NumBytesRead,
  _In_  UCHAR  Channel
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Context [in]

Pointer to the device extension of a parallel device's physical device object (<a href="wdkgloss.p#wdkgloss.pdo#wdkgloss.pdo"><i>PDO</i></a>).


### -param Buffer [out]

Pointer to a read buffer that the caller allocates.


### -param NumBytesToRead [in]

Specifies the number of bytes to read. Must less than or equal to the number of bytes in the caller-allocated read buffer.


### -param NumBytesRead [out]

Specifies the number of bytes that were actually read from the parallel device and saved in the caller-allocated read buffer.


### -param Channel [in]

Not used.


## -returns
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>The requested data was successfully transferred from the device.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_<i>Xxx</i></b></dt>
</dl>An internal operation resulted in an NTSTATUS error.

 


## -remarks
To obtain a pointer to the system-supplied PPARALLEL_READ callback, a kernel-mode driver uses an <a href="..\parallel\ni-parallel-ioctl_internal_parclass_connect.md">IOCTL_INTERNAL_PARCLASS_CONNECT</a> request, which returns a <a href="..\parallel\ns-parallel-_parclass_information.md">PARCLASS_INFORMATION</a> structure. The <b>ParallelRead</b> member of the PARCLASS_INFORMATION structure is a pointer to this callback.

A client can only use this routine if it has a lock on a parallel port. A client obtains a lock on a parallel port by using an <a href="..\parallel\ni-parallel-ioctl_internal_lock_port.md">IOCTL_INTERNAL_LOCK_PORT</a> request.

The PPARALLEL_READ callback runs in the caller's thread at the IRQL of the caller.
