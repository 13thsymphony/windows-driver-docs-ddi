# IOCTL_INTERNAL_PARCLASS_CONNECT IOCTL
The <b>IOCTL_INTERNAL_PARCLASS_CONNECT</b> request returns information about a parallel port and the callback routines that the system-supplied bus driver for parallel ports provides to operate the parallel port.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c05a1a1e-308a-4b9f-af43-761c4c14d6af">Connecting to a Parallel Device</a>.

### Major Code
[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](xref:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control")

### Input Buffer
A <a href="..\parallel\ns-parallel-_parclass_information.md">PARCLASS_INFORMATION</a> structure.

### Input Buffer Length
The value of the <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.OutputBufferLength</b> member is set to the size, in bytes, of a <a href="..\parallel\ns-parallel-_parclass_information.md">PARCLASS_INFORMATION</a> structure.

### Output Buffer
The <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member points to a <a href="..\parallel\ns-parallel-_parclass_information.md">PARCLASS_INFORMATION</a> structure that the client allocates to output information.

### Output Buffer Length
The size of a <a href="..\parallel\ns-parallel-_parclass_information.md">PARCLASS_INFORMATION</a> structure.
