# IOCTL_INTERNAL_PARALLEL_PORT_FREE IOCTL



## -description
<p>The <b>IOCTL_INTERNAL_PARALLEL_PORT_FREE</b> request frees a parallel port. After using a parallel port, a client must free it. Microsoft recommends using the system-supplied <a href="..\parallel\nc-parallel-pparallel-free-routine.md">PPARALLEL_FREE_ROUTINE</a> callback to free a parallel port because there is no functional advantage to using an <b>IOCTL_INTERNAL_PARALLEL_PORT_FREE</b> request to free the port.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ea3a1998-9e31-4047-9193-6b402db222c9">Synchronizing the Use of a ParallelPort</a>.</p>
