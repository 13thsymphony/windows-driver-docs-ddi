# IOCTL_INTERNAL_DESELECT_DEVICE IOCTL



## -description
The <b>IOCTL_INTERNAL_DESELECT_DEVICE</b> request deselects an IEEE 1284.3 daisy-chain device or an IEEE 1284 end-of-chain device attached to a parallel port.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/1a3ac1b1-9180-4b71-8740-70c6fbe9a885">Selecting and Deselecting an IEEE 1284 Device Attached to a ParallelPort</a>.



## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
The <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member points to a <a href="..\parallel\ns-parallel-_parallel_1284_command.md">PARALLEL_1284_COMMAND</a> structure that the client allocates to input IEEE 1284.3 command information. The client can free the parallel port by not setting the PAR_HAVE_PORT_KEEP_PORT flag in the <b>CommandFlags</b> member.


### -input-buffer-length
The <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> member specifies the size, in bytes, of the PARALLEL_1284_COMMAND structure.


### -output-buffer
None.


### -output-buffer-length
None.


### -in-out-buffer

<text></text>

### -inout-buffer-length

<text></text>

### -status-block
I/O Status block
The <b>Information</b> member is set to zero.

The <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the generic status values returned by internal device control requests for parallel ports or to one of the following values:



The value of the <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> member is less than the size, in bytes, of a PARALLEL_1284_COMMAND structure.

The specified device is not flagged internally as an end-of-chain device, and the specified ID value is greater than the number of existing daisy-chain devices.
