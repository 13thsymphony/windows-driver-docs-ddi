# IOCTL_INTERNAL_INIT_1284_3_BUS IOCTL
The <b>IOCTL_INTERNAL_INIT_1284_3_BUS</b> request initializes and assigns an IEEE 1284.3 device ID to all the 1284.3 daisy chain devices that are attached to a parallel port.

Windows 2000 supports from zero to four daisy chain devices and an end-of-chain device simultaneously attached to a parallel port. Windows XP supports from zero to two daisy chain devices and an end-of-chain device simultaneously attached to a parallel port.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    This request is included primarily for test purposes, and Microsoft does not recommend using it during the normal operation of a parallel port.</div><div> </div>For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/80222ed9-f900-4d97-b459-2d8ca780e1d1">Device Stacks for ParallelPorts and Devices</a>.
