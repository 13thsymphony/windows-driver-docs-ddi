# IOCTL_INTERNAL_PARALLEL_DISCONNECT_INTERRUPT IOCTL



## -description
The <b>IOCTL_INTERNAL_PARALLEL_DISCONNECT_INTERRUPT</b> request disconnects an interrupt service routine (and an optional deferred port check service routine) that was connected by using an <a href="..\parallel\ni-parallel-ioctl_internal_parallel_connect_interrupt.md">IOCTL_INTERNAL_PARALLEL_CONNECT_INTERRUPT</a> request. Only kernel-mode drivers can connect and disconnect an interrupt routine.


## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
The <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member points to a <a href="parports.parallel_interrupt_service_routine">PARALLEL_INTERRUPT_SERVICE_ROUTINE</a> structure that the client allocates for the input of interrupt service information.

### -input-buffer-length
The <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> member is set to the size, in bytes, of a PARALLEL_INTERRUPT_SERVICE_ROUTINE structure. 

### -output-buffer
None.

### -output-buffer-length
None.

### -in-out-buffer

<text></text>

### -inout-buffer-length

<text></text>

### -status-block
I/O Status block
The <b>Information</b> member is set to zero. 

The <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the generic status values returned by internal device control requests for parallel ports or to one of the following values:



The value of the <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> member is less than the size, in bytes, of a PARALLEL_INTERRUPT_SERVICE_ROUTINE structure.

The specified interrupt service routine is not connected.
