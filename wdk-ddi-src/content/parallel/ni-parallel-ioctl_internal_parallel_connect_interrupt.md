# IOCTL_INTERNAL_PARALLEL_CONNECT_INTERRUPT IOCTL



## -description
The <b>IOCTL_INTERNAL_PARALLEL_CONNECT_INTERRUPT</b> request connects an optional interrupt service routine and an optional <i>deferred port check</i> routine to a parallel port. Only kernel-mode drivers can use this request.
The connect interrupt request returns information that the driver can use in the context of a driver-specific ISR. The information includes a pointer to the interrupt object and pointers to callback routines that allocate and free the parallel port at IRQL = DIRQL.


## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
The <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member points to a <a href="parports.parallel_interrupt_service_routine">PARALLEL_INTERRUPT_SERVICE_ROUTINE</a> structure that the client allocates to input interrupt service information. The system-supplied function driver for parallel ports uses the same memory buffer, but casts it to a different data type to output information.

### -input-buffer-length
The <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> member is set to the size, in bytes, of a PARALLEL_INTERRUPT_SERVICE_ROUTINE structure.

### -output-buffer
The <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member points to a PARALLEL_INTERRUPT_INFORMATION structure that the parallel port function driver uses to output parallel interrupt information. 

### -output-buffer-length
The <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.OutputBufferLength</b> member is set to the size, in bytes, of a <a href="parports.parallel_interrupt_information">PARALLEL_INTERRUPT_INFORMATION</a> structure.

### -in-out-buffer

<text></text>

### -inout-buffer-length

<text></text>

### -status-block
I/O Status block
If the request is successful, the <b>Information</b> member is set to the size, in bytes, of a <a href="parports.parallel_interrupt_information">PARALLEL_INTERRUPT_INFORMATION</a> structure. Otherwise, the <b>Information</b> member is set to zero. 

The <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the generic status values returned by internal device control requests for parallel ports or to one of the following values:



At least one of the following is true: 

The value of the <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> member is less than the size, in bytes, of a PARALLEL_INTERRUPT_SERVICE_ROUTINE structure. 

The value of the <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.OuputBufferLength</b> member is less than the size, in bytes, of a PARALLEL_INTERRUPT_INFORMATION structure.
