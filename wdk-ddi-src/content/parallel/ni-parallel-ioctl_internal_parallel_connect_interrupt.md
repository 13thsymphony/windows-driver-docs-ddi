# IOCTL_INTERNAL_PARALLEL_CONNECT_INTERRUPT IOCTL
The <b>IOCTL_INTERNAL_PARALLEL_CONNECT_INTERRUPT</b> request connects an optional interrupt service routine and an optional <i>deferred port check</i> routine to a parallel port. Only kernel-mode drivers can use this request.

The connect interrupt request returns information that the driver can use in the context of a driver-specific ISR. The information includes a pointer to the interrupt object and pointers to callback routines that allocate and free the parallel port at IRQL = DIRQL.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    Microsoft does not recommend using a client-supplied interrupt routine. The use of interrupts might cause system instability. By default, the connect interrupt request is disabled. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/62d3a388-6de6-4019-ab95-56b5e96d0891">Connecting an Interrupt Service Routine to a ParallelPort</a>.</div><div> </div>

### Major Code
[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](xref:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control")

### Input Buffer
The <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member points to a <a href="..\parallel\ns-parallel-_parallel_interrupt_service_routine.md">PARALLEL_INTERRUPT_SERVICE_ROUTINE</a> structure that the client allocates to input interrupt service information. The system-supplied function driver for parallel ports uses the same memory buffer, but casts it to a different data type to output information.

### Input Buffer Length
The <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> member is set to the size, in bytes, of a PARALLEL_INTERRUPT_SERVICE_ROUTINE structure.

### Output Buffer
The <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member points to a PARALLEL_INTERRUPT_INFORMATION structure that the parallel port function driver uses to output parallel interrupt information.

### Output Buffer Length
The <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.OutputBufferLength</b> member is set to the size, in bytes, of a <a href="..\parallel\ns-parallel-_parallel_interrupt_information.md">PARALLEL_INTERRUPT_INFORMATION</a> structure.

### Status Block
If the request is successful, the <b>Information</b> member is set to the size, in bytes, of a <a href="..\parallel\ns-parallel-_parallel_interrupt_information.md">PARALLEL_INTERRUPT_INFORMATION</a> structure. Otherwise, the <b>Information</b> member is set to zero. 

The <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the generic status values returned by internal device control requests for parallel ports or to one of the following values:
