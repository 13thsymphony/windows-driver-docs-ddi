# _URS_HARDWARE_EVENT enumeration



## -description
Defines values for the hardware events that a client driver for a USB dual-role controller can report.



## -syntax

````
typedef enum _URS_HARDWARE_EVENT { 
  UrsHardwareEventNone         = 0,
  UrsHardwareEventDetach,
  UrsHardwareEventIdGround,
  UrsHardwareEventIdFloat,
  UrsHardwareEventPortTypeDfp,
  UrsHardwareEventPortTypeUfp
} URS_HARDWARE_EVENT, *PURS_HARDWARE_EVENT;
````


## -enum-fields

### -field UrsHardwareEventNone

Internal use only. 


### -field UrsHardwareEventDetach

A detach event occurred on a port of a USB Type-C system. 


### -field UrsHardwareEventIdGround

This event indicates that the ID pin is grounded.


### -field UrsHardwareEventIdFloat

This event indicates that the ID pin is floating.


### -field UrsHardwareEventPortTypeDfp

The Type-C connector has resolved to DFP. Not to be used directly by the URS client driver.


### -field UrsHardwareEventPortTypeUfp

The Type-C connector has resolved to UFP. Not to be used directly by the URS client driver.


## -remarks
Values defined for USB Type-C systems should not be directly used by the client driver. Instead the driver should report that it does not support hardware event reporting by calling <a href="..\ursdevice\nf-ursdevice-urssethardwareeventsupport.md">UrsSetHardwareEventSupport</a>. These hardware events are detected by a USB Type-C connector driver, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt188011">USB Type-C connector driver programming reference</a>. </p>
