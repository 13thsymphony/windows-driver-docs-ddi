# _NDIS_WWAN_SERVICE_ACTIVATION_STATUS structure



## -description
The NDIS_WWAN_SERVICE_ACTIVATION_STATUS structure represents the status of service activation on the
  MB device.


## -syntax

````
typedef struct _NDIS_WWAN_SERVICE_ACTIVATION_STATUS {
  NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER             Header;
  WWAN_STATUS                    uStatus;

## -struct-fields

### -field Header

The header with type, revision, and size information about the NDIS_WWAN_SERVICE_ACTIVATION_STATUS
     structure. The MB Service sets the header with the values that are shown in the following table when it
     sends the data structure to the miniport driver for 
     <i>set</i> operations. Miniport drivers must set the header with the same values when they send the data
     structure to the MB service.
