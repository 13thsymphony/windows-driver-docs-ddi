# _ADDRESS_RANGE structure
The ADDRESS_RANGE structure describes a range in a IEEE 1394 device's address space.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _ADDRESS_RANGE {
  USHORT AR_Off_High;
  USHORT AR_Length;
  ULONG  AR_Off_Low;
} ADDRESS_RANGE, *PADDRESS_RANGE;
````

## Members


`AR_Length`

Specifies the length, in bytes, of a 1394 address buffer.

`AR_Off_High`

Specifies the high order bits of the 1394 address within the buffer.

`AR_Off_Low`

Specifies the low order bits of the 1394 address within the buffer.
