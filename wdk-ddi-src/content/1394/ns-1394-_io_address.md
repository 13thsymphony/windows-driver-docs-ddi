# _IO_ADDRESS structure
The IO_ADDRESS structure specifies the 1394 64-bit destination address for read, write and lock operations.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _IO_ADDRESS {
  NODE_ADDRESS   IA_Destination_ID;
  ADDRESS_OFFSET IA_Destination_Offset;
} IO_ADDRESS, *PIO_ADDRESS;
````

## Members


`IA_Destination_ID`

Holds a structure of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537435">NODE_ADDRESS</a> containing the destination node address.

`IA_Destination_Offset`

Holds a structure of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536906">ADDRESS_OFFSET</a> that specifies the index of the 1394 address within the address array.
