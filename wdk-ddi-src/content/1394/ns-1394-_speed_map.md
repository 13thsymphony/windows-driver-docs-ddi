# _SPEED_MAP structure
The SPEED_MAP structure is stores a IEEE 1394 bus speed map.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _SPEED_MAP {
  USHORT SPD_Length;
  USHORT SPD_CRC;
  ULONG  SPD_Generation;
  UCHAR  SPD_Speed_Code[4032];
} SPEED_MAP, *PSPEED_MAP;
````

## Members


`SPD_CRC`

Specifies the CRC value for the speed map.

`SPD_Generation`

Specifies the generation count for the bus reset that corresponds to this speed map.

`SPD_Length`

Specifies the number of quadlets in the speed map.

`SPD_Speed_Code`

Specifies an array of speed codes. Currently, the possible values are:

SCODE_100_RATE

SCODE_200_RATE

SCODE_400_RATE

## Remarks
The SPEED_MAP structure describes the maximum speed that devices on the bus can attain. All values in this structure are recorded in big-endian format.
