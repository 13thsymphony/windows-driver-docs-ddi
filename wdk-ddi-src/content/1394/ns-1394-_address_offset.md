# _ADDRESS_OFFSET structure
The ADDRESS_OFFSET structure specifies the 48-bit address within a device's IEEE 1394 address space.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _ADDRESS_OFFSET {
  USHORT Off_High;
  ULONG  Off_Low;
} ADDRESS_OFFSET, *PADDRESS_OFFSET;
````

## Members


`Off_High`

Specifies the high order offset for a IEEE 1394 address.

`Off_Low`

Specifies the low order offset for a IEEE 1394 address.
