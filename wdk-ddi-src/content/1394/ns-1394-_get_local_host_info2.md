# _GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO2 structure
The GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO2 structure contains the data returned by a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537644">REQUEST_GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO</a> request using <b>u.GetLocalHostInformation.nLevel</b> GET_HOST_CAPABILITIES.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO2 {
  ULONG HostCapabilities;
  ULONG MaxAsyncReadRequest;
  ULONG MaxAsyncWriteRequest;
} GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO2, *PGET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO2;
````

## Members


`HostCapabilities`

Indicates the host capabilities. The following table lists the values that can be assigned to th is member:



<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HOST_INFO_PACKET_BASED </td>
<td>The host controller supports packet-based isochronous transactions. 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HOST_INFO_STREAM_BASED </td>
<td>The host controller supports stream-based isochronous transactions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HOST_INFO_SUPPORTS_ISOCH_STRIPPING </td>
<td>The host controller supports configurable stripping of header information. 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HOST_INFO_SUPPORTS_START_ON_CYCLE </td>
<td>The host controller supports synchronizing start on specific isochronous cycle times. 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HOST_INFO_SUPPORTS_RETURNING_ISO_HDR </td>
<td>The host controller does not automatically strip off the isochronous packet header. 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HOST_INFO_SUPPORTS_ISO_HDR_INSERTION </td>
<td>The host controller supports the DESCRIPTOR_HEADER_SCATTER_GATHER flag in ISOCH_DESCRIPTOR. 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HOST_INFO_SUPPORTS_ISO_DUAL_BUFFER_RX </td>
<td>The host controller supports the RESOURCE_VARIABLE_ISOCH_PAYLOAD flag in ISOCH_DESCRIPTOR. 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HOST_INFO_DMA_DOUBLE_BUFFERING_ENABLED DMA </td>
<td>transfers that are made to/from the host controller will be double-buffered by using system map registers. System map registers limit the size of a single transfer. Check the MaxDmaBufferSize value that is returned in the GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO7 structure by a REQUEST_GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO request and limit the transfer size accordingly.</td>
</tr>
</table>

`MaxAsyncReadRequest`

The bus driver fills in this member with the maximum size asynchronous read request that the host controller supports.

`MaxAsyncWriteRequest`

The bus driver fills in this member with the maximum size asynchronous write request that the host controller supports.

## Remarks
Port drivers that return the HOST_INFO_PACKET_BASED flag support the IsochAllocateResources request's RESOURCE_USE_PACKET_BASED flag. Port drivers that return the HOST_STREAM_PACKET_BASED flag support stream-based I/O. If the host controller does not support stream-based I/O, the driver must use packet-based I/O, and set the RESOURCE_USE_PACKET_BASED flag when issuing the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537649">REQUEST_ISOCH_ALLOCATE_RESOURCES</a>.

Some host controllers automatically strip the packet header off an isochronous packet. If a host controller does not automatically strip the header, the port driver returns the HOST_INFO_SUPPORTS_ISO_HDR flag. Some host controllers allow a driver to configure the host controller to strip off a given number of quadlets; for such controllers the port driver returns the HOST_INFO_SUPPORTS_ISOCH_STRIPPING flag. The driver should check this flag before calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537649">REQUEST_ISOCH_ALLOCATE_RESOURCES</a> with the RESOURCE_STRIP_ADDITIONAL_QUADLETS flag.

If a host controller supports synchronizing <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537655">REQUEST_ISOCH_LISTEN</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537660">REQUEST_ISOCH_TALK</a> requests to the isochronous cycle time, the port driver returns the HOST_INFO_SUPPORTS_START_ON_CYCLE. Drivers should check this flag before attempting to issue an REQUEST_ISOCH_ALLOCATE_RESOURCES request using the RESOURCE_SYNCH_ON_TIME flag, or before attaching a buffer whose <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537401">ISOCH_DESCRIPTOR</a> has the DESCRIPTOR_SYNCH_ON_TIME flag set.
