# _IRB_REQ_FREE_ADDRESS_RANGE structure
This structure contains the fields necessary for the 1394 stack to carry out a free address range reqeust.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _IRB_REQ_FREE_ADDRESS_RANGE {
  ULONG          nAddressesToFree;
  PADDRESS_RANGE p1394AddressRange;
  PHANDLE        pAddressRange;
  PVOID          DeviceExtension;
} IRB_REQ_FREE_ADDRESS_RANGE;
````

## Members


`DeviceExtension`

Points to the device extension associated with the device object. Not setting this member can lead to unexpected behavior when the driver tries to access the allocated address space.

`nAddressesToFree`

Specifies the number of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536908">ADDRESS_RANGE</a> structures pointed to by <b>IRB.u.FreeAddressRange.p1394AddressRange</b>

`p1394AddressRange`

Specifies a pointer to an array of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff536908">ADDRESS_RANGE</a> data structures to be released. These address ranges were returned in a prior successful call to <b>AllocateAddressRange</b>.

`pAddressRange`

Points to the handle that was previously received in <b>IRB.u.AllocateAddressRange.hAddressRange</b> in the  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537632">REQUEST_ALLOCATE_ADDRESS_RANGE</a> request.
