# _GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO8 structure



## -description
The <b>GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO8</b> structure contains the data returned by a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537644">REQUEST_GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO</a> request with <b>u.GetLocalHostInformation.nLevel</b> set to GET_HOST_DDI_VERSION.


## -syntax

````
typedef struct _GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO8 {
  USHORT MajorVersion;
  USHORT MinorVersion;
} GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO8, *PGET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO8;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field MajorVersion

The major version of the 1394 bus driver interface.

### -field MinorVersion

The minor version of the 1394 bus driver interface.

## -remarks
A client driver can determine whether the 1394 bus driver
loaded in the IEEE 1394 driver stack is the new 1394 bus driver or the legacy
1394 bus driver. A new <b>nLevel</b> value has been added
to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537644">REQUEST_GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO</a> I/O
request to return the version of the DDIs that the 1394 bus driver supports.


To determine whether the 1394 bus driver is the new 1394 bus
driver or the legacy 1394 bus driver,

If the driver stack contains the new 1394 bus
driver, the request returns a status value of STATUS_SUCCESS. Otherwise, the
legacy 1394 bus driver returns a status value of
STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.
