# _IRB_REQ_ISOCH_FREE_RESOURCES structure
This structure contains the fields necessary to carry out a IsochFreeResources request.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _IRB_REQ_ISOCH_FREE_RESOURCES {
  HANDLE hResource;
} IRB_REQ_ISOCH_FREE_RESOURCES;
````

## Members


`hResource`

Specifies the resource handle to release.

## Remarks
The bus driver sets <b>Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status</b> to STATUS_SUCCESS on success. All isochronous buffers that were attached to this resource must be detached prior to issuing this call. If a device driver attempts to free a resource handle with isochronous buffers still attached to it, the handle is not freed and the bus driver returns STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED instead.
