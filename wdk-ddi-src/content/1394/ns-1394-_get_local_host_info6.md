# _GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO6 structure



## -description
The GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO6 structure contains the data returned by a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537644">REQUEST_GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO</a> request using <b>u.GetLocalHostInformation.nLevel</b> = GET_HOST_CSR_CONTENTS.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO6 {
  ADDRESS_OFFSET CsrBaseAddress;
  ULONG          CsrDataLength;
  PVOID          CsrDataBuffer;
} GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO6, *PGET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO6;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field CsrBaseAddress

Specifies the base address to examine in the CSR. <b>CsrBaseAddress.Off_High</b> must be INITIAL_REGISTER_SPACE_HI. The possible values of <b>CsrBaseAddress.Off_Low</b> are as follows.

<table>
<tr>
<th>CsrBaseAddress.Off_Low</th>
<th>Type of Data</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
SPEED_MAP_LOCATION

</td>
<td>
The current speed map. The bus driver converts this from big-endian to machine-native format before it returns the data.<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The new 1394 bus driver provided with Windows 7 does not support the SPEED_MAP_LOCATION flag in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537644">REQUEST_GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO</a> request. The speed map is obsolete in the IEEE-1394a specification.</div>
<div> </div>


</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
TOPOLOGY_MAP_LOCATION

</td>
<td>
The current topology map. The bus driver converts this from big-endian to machine-native format before it returns the data.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -field CsrDataLength

Specifies the length in bytes of the buffer that <b>CsrDataBuffer</b> points to.


### -field CsrDataBuffer

Pointer to the buffer where the bus driver returns the requested CSR data.


## -remarks
When submitted in a REQUEST_GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO request, if the <b>CsrDataLength</b> is smaller than the size of the requested data, STATUS_INVALID_BUFFER_SIZE is returned. In this case, the correct buffer size is filled in the <b>CsrDataLength</b> member.
