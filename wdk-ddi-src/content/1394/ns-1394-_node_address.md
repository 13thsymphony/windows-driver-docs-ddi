# _NODE_ADDRESS structure
The NODE_ADDRESS structure specifies the 10-bit bus number and 6-bit node number that serve as the node address for a 1394 node.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _NODE_ADDRESS {
  USHORT NA_Node_Number  :6;
  USHORT NA_Bus_Number  :10;
} NODE_ADDRESS, *PNODE_ADDRESS;
````

## Members


`NA_Bus_Number`

Specifies the 10-bit bus number. This member specifies bits 0-10 of the node address.

`NA_Node_Number`

Specifies the 6-bit node number. This member contains bits 10-15 of the node address.
