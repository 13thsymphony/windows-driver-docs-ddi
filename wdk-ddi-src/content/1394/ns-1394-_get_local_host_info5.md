# _GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO5 structure
The GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO5 structure contains the data returned by a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537644">REQUEST_GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO</a> request using <b>u.GetLocalHostInformation.nLevel</b> = GET_HOST_CONFIG_ROM.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO5 {
  PVOID ConfigRom;
  ULONG ConfigRomLength;
} GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO5, *PGET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO5;
````

## Members


`ConfigRom`

Pointer to the beginning of the buffer to be filled with the local host's configuration ROM.

`ConfigRomLength`

Specifies the length of the buffer pointed to by <b>ConfigRom</b>.

## Remarks
When submitted in a REQUEST_GET_LOCAL_HOST_INFO request, if the <b>ConfigRomLength</b> is smaller than the size of the Configuration ROM, a status code of STATUS_INVALID_BUFFER_SIZE is returned. In this case, the correct buffer size is filled in the <b>ConfigRomLength</b> member.
