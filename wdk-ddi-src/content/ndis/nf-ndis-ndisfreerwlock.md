# NdisFreeRWLock function
The 
  <b>NdisFreeRWLock</b> function frees a read/write lock that was previously allocated with the 
  <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisallocaterwlock.md">NdisAllocateRWLock</a> function.

## Syntax

````
VOID NdisFreeRWLock(
  _In_ PNDIS_RW_LOCK_EX Lock
);
````

## Parameters

`Lock`

A pointer to an opaque 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567279">NDIS_RW_LOCK_EX</a> variable that represents a
     lock. The caller can use this lock to gain write or read access to resources that are shared among
     non-ISR driver threads.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

NDIS drivers call the 
    <b>NdisFreeRWLock</b> function to free the 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567279">NDIS_RW_LOCK_EX</a> structure and any associated
    resources that were previously allocated with the 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisallocaterwlock.md">NdisAllocateRWLock</a> function.

A driver must call the 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisreleaserwlock.md">NdisReleaseRWLock</a> function to release a
    read/write lock before it calls the 
    <b>NdisFreeRWLock</b> function.
