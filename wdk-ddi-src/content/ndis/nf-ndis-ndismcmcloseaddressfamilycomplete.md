# NdisMCmCloseAddressFamilyComplete function
<b>NdisMCmCloseAddressFamilyComplete</b> returns the final status of a client's request, for which the MCM
  driver returned NDIS_STATUS_PENDING, to close the AF.

## Syntax

````
VOID NdisMCmCloseAddressFamilyComplete(
  [in] NDIS_STATUS Status,
  [in] NDIS_HANDLE NdisAfHandle
);
````

## Parameters

`_S_`

TBD

`_H_`

TBD


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

An MCM driver must call 
    <b>NdisMCmCloseAddressFamilyComplete</b> if its 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-protocol_cm_close_af.md">ProtocolCmCloseAf</a> function previously
    returned NDIS_STATUS_PENDING for the given 
    <i>NdisAfHandle</i> . The client, which initiated the pended close-AF operation with a call to 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisclcloseaddressfamily.md">NdisClCloseAddressFamily</a>, cannot
    release the resources it allocated to track communications on the AF until the MCM driver's call to 
    <b>NdisMCmCloseAddressFamilyComplete</b>.

A call to 
    <b>NdisMCmCloseAddressFamilyComplete</b> causes NDIS to call the client's 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-protocol_cl_close_af_complete.md">
    ProtocolClCloseAfComplete</a> function.

The MCM driver cannot subsequently use the 
    <i>NdisAfHandle</i>, which is invalid for the MCM driver when 
    <b>NdisMCmCloseAddressFamilyComplete</b> returns control.

Only connection-oriented miniport drivers that provide integrated call-management support can call 
    <b>NdisMCmCloseAddressFamilyComplete</b>. Stand-alone call managers, which register themselves with NDIS
    as protocol drivers, call 
    <b>NdisCmCloseAddressFamilyComplete</b> instead.
