# NdisMWriteLogData function



## -description
<b>NdisMWriteLogData</b> transfers driver-supplied information into the log file for consumption and display
  by a driver-dedicated Win32 application.



## -syntax

````
NDIS_STATUS NdisMWriteLogData(
  _In_ NDIS_HANDLE LogHandle,
  _In_ PVOID       LogBuffer,
  _In_ UINT        LogBufferSize
);
````


## -parameters

### -param LogHandle [in]

Specifies the handle returned by 
     <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndismcreatelog.md">NdisMCreateLog</a>.


### -param LogBuffer [in]

Pointer to a driver-allocated buffer containing the information to be written.


### -param LogBufferSize [in]

Specifies how many bytes of data to copy into the log file.


## -returns
<b>NdisMWriteLogData</b> can return one of the following:
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>The driver-supplied data at 
       <i>LogBuffer</i> has been copied into the log file.
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW</b></dt>
</dl>The given 
       <i>LogBufferSize</i> is too large, that is, larger than the log file itself.

 


## -remarks
If the driver-dedicated application has an outstanding request for log file data, 
    <b>NdisMWriteLogData</b> satisfies that request as soon as it has copied the driver-supplied information
    into the log file.

The miniport driver can supply a 
    <i>LogBuffer</i> pointer to a location on the kernel stack if it is currently running at IRQL &lt;
    DISPATCH_LEVEL. Otherwise, 
    <i>LogBuffer</i> must access a buffer that the driver allocated from nonpaged pool.

The driver must release any spin lock it is holding before calling 
    <b>NdisMWriteLogData</b>.

<b>NdisMWriteLogData</b> does not recognize boundaries between log records, nor does the Win32 function, 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/1d35c087-6672-4fc6-baa1-a886dd9d3878">DeviceIoControl</a>, which applications can call with IOCTL_NDIS_GET_LOG_DATA to retrieve data written
    to an NDIS log file by an NDIS miniport driver. 
    <b>NdisMWriteLogData</b> writes all miniport driver-supplied data at 
    <i>LogBuffer</i> into the log file as a byte stream. 
    <b>DeviceIoControl</b> reads the data from such a log as a byte stream, as well.

Consequently, an application reading an NDIS log must collect retrieved data into records. To aid such
    an application in collecting variable-length records, any miniport driver writing to such a log can
    insert a marker at the beginning of each record. Then, the application formatting the retrieved data can
    search for these markers to determine the start of each record.
