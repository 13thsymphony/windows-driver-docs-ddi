# NdisFDirectOidRequestComplete function



## -description
Filter drivers call the 
  <b>NdisFDirectOidRequestComplete</b> function to return the final status of a direct OID request for which
  the driver's 
  <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-filter_direct_oid_request.md">FilterDirectOidRequest</a> function
  returned NDIS_STATUS_PENDING.



## -syntax

````
VOID NdisFDirectOidRequestComplete(
  _In_ NDIS_HANDLE       NdisFilterHandle,
  _In_ PNDIS_OID_REQUEST OidRequest,
  _In_ NDIS_STATUS       Status
);
````


## -parameters

### -param NdisFilterHandle [in]

The NDIS handle that identifies this filter module NDIS passed the handle to the filter driver in
     a call to the 
     <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-filter_attach.md">FilterAttach</a> function.


### -param OidRequest [in]

A pointer to a buffer that is formatted as an 
     <a href="..\ndis\ns-ndis-_ndis_oid_request.md">NDIS_OID_REQUEST</a> structure. The filter
     driver obtained this pointer as an input parameter to its 
     <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-filter_direct_oid_request.md">
     FilterDirectOidRequest</a> function.


### -param Status [in]

The final status of the request operation: NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS or any driver-determined
     NDIS_STATUS_<i>Xxx</i> value except NDIS_STATUS_PENDING.


## -returns
None


## -remarks
A filter driver that returns NDIS_STATUS_PENDING from its 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-filter_direct_oid_request.md">FilterDirectOidRequest</a> function
    must call the 
    <b>NdisFDirectOidRequestComplete</b> function after the driver has finished the request operation.

If an overlying driver originated the direct OID request, NDIS calls the request complete function
    (see 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-protocol_direct_oid_request_complete.md">
    ProtocolDirectOidRequestComplete</a> and 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-filter_direct_oid_request_complete.md">
    FilterDirectOidRequestComplete</a>) of the overlying driver that originated the request.
