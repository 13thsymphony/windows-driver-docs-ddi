# NdisReleaseRWLock function
The 
  <b>NdisReleaseRWLock</b> function releases a read/write lock that the caller uses to gain access to
  resources that are shared between driver threads.

## Syntax

````
VOID NdisReleaseRWLock(
  _In_ PNDIS_RW_LOCK_EX Lock,
  _In_ PLOCK_STATE_EX   LockState
);
````

## Parameters

`Lock`

A pointer to an opaque 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567279">NDIS_RW_LOCK_EX</a> variable that represents a
     lock. The caller can use this lock to gain write or read access to resources that are shared between
     non-ISR driver threads.

`LockState`

A pointer to an opaque 
     <a href="..\ndis\ns-ndis-_lock_state_ex.md">LOCK_STATE_EX</a> variable that tracks the state
     of the lock. This variable exists in the interval between the times that the caller obtains and releases
     the lock. The caller must use a different variable of type LOCK_STATE_EX for each attempt that it makes
     to obtain the lock from the same non-ISR driver thread.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

NDIS drivers call the 
    <b>NdisReleaseRWLock</b> function to release a read/write lock that was previously obtained by calling the
    
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisacquirerwlockread.md">NdisAcquireRWLockRead</a> or 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisacquirerwlockwrite.md">
    NdisAcquireRWLockWrite</a> function.

A driver must obtain a read/write lock before the driver can call 
    <b>NdisReleaseRWLock</b>. Each call to obtain a lock requires a reciprocal call to 
    <b>NdisReleaseRWLock</b>.

The acquisition of an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567279">NDIS_RW_LOCK_EX</a> is affinitized to the current processor.  Drivers must call <b>NdisReleaseRWLock</b> on the same processor that made the corresponding call to <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisacquirerwlockread.md">NdisAcquireRWLockRead</a> or <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisacquirerwlockwrite.md">NdisAcquireRWLockWrite</a>.

<b>NdisReleaseRWLock</b> restores the original IRQL that was used by its caller before the lock was
    obtained.
