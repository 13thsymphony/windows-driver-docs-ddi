# FILTER_CANCEL_DIRECT_OID_REQUEST callback function
NDIS calls a filter driver's 
  <i>FilterCancelDirectOidRequest</i> function to cancel a direct OID request.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  You must declare the function by using the <b>FILTER_CANCEL_DIRECT_OID_REQUEST</b> type. For more
   information, see the following Examples section.</div><div> </div>

## Syntax

```
FILTER_CANCEL_DIRECT_OID_REQUEST FilterCancelDirectOidRequest;

void FilterCancelDirectOidRequest(
  NDIS_HANDLE FilterModuleContext,
  PVOID RequestId
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`FilterModuleContext`

A handle to the context area for the filter module that is the target of this request. The filter
     driver created and initialized this context area in the 
     <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-filter_attach.md">FilterAttach</a> function.

`RequestId`

A cancellation identifier for the request. This identifier specifies the direct OID requests that
     match this value in the 
     <b>RequestId</b> member of the 
     <a href="..\ndis\ns-ndis-_ndis_oid_request.md">NDIS_OID_REQUEST</a> structure.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

<i>FilterCancelDirectOidRequest</i> is an optional function. If a filter driver does
    not use direct OID requests, it can set the entry point for this function to <b>NULL</b> when it calls the 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisfregisterfilterdriver.md">
    NdisFRegisterFilterDriver</a> function.

When NDIS calls 
    <i>FilterCancelDirectOidRequest</i>, the filter driver should attempt to call 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisfdirectoidrequestcomplete.md">
    NdisFDirectOidRequestComplete</a> function as soon as possible.

If a filter driver does not queue direct OID requests, the driver is not required to provide a 
    <i>FilterCancelDirectOidRequest</i> function. If the filter driver does not specify a 
    <i>FilterCancelDirectOidRequest</i> entry point, NDIS calls the cancel OID request
    function of the underlying driver.

NDIS calls the 
    <i>FilterCancelDirectOidRequest</i> function when the originator of the request
    cancels therequest.

If the request processing is still not complete in a filter driver, the driver calls the 
    <b>NdisFDirectOidRequestComplete</b> function with the status set to NDIS_STATUS_REQUEST_ABORTED.

If the filter driver forwarded the request to an underlying driver and the processing is still not
    complete, the filter driver calls the 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisfcanceldirectoidrequest.md">
    NdisFCancelDirectOidRequest</a> function with the 
    <i>OidRequest</i> parameter set to the value that it sent to the underlying
    driver.

NDIS calls 
    <i>FilterCancelDirectOidRequest</i> at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL.

<h3><a id="Examples"></a><a id="examples"></a><a id="EXAMPLES"></a>Examples</h3>
To define a <i>FilterCancelDirectOidRequest</i> function, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of function you're defining. Windows provides a set of function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the function types helps <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2F3549EF-B50F-455A-BDC7-1F67782B8DCA">Code Analysis for Drivers</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/74feeb16-387c-4796-987a-aff3fb79b556">Static Driver Verifier</a> (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it's a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

For example, to define a <i>FilterCancelDirectOidRequest</i> function that is named "MyCancelDirectOidRequest", use the <b>FILTER_CANCEL_DIRECT_OID_REQUEST</b> type as shown in this code example:

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>FILTER_CANCEL_DIRECT_OID_REQUEST MyCancelDirectOidRequest;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
Then, implement your function as follows:

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>_Use_decl_annotations_
VOID
 MyCancelDirectOidRequest(
    NDIS_HANDLE  FilterModuleContext,
    PVOID  RequestId
    )
  {...}</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
The <b>FILTER_CANCEL_DIRECT_OID_REQUEST</b> function type is defined in the Ndis.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation to your function definition.  The _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the <b>FILTER_CANCEL_DIRECT_OID_REQUEST</b> function type in the header file are used.  For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/232c4272-0bf0-4a4e-9560-3bceeca8a3e3">Declaring Functions by Using Function Role Types for NDIS Drivers</a>.

For information about  _Use_decl_annotations_, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=286697">Annotating Function Behavior</a>.
