# NdisMCoActivateVcComplete function
<b>NdisMCoActivateVcComplete</b> notifies NDIS and the call manager that the miniport driver has finished
  processing a CM-initiated activate-VC request, for which the miniport driver previously returned
  NDIS_STATUS_PENDING.

## Syntax

````
VOID NdisMCoActivateVcComplete(
  _In_ NDIS_STATUS         Status,
  _In_ NDIS_HANDLE         NdisVcHandle,
  _In_ PCO_CALL_PARAMETERS CallParameters
);
````

## Parameters

`Status`

#####

`NdisVcHandle`

Specifies the handle identifying the VC. The caller obtained this handle from its per-VC state,
     designated by the 
     <i>MiniportVcContext</i> passed as an input parameter to its 
     <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-miniport_co_activate_vc.md">
     MiniportCoActivateVc</a> function.

`CallParameters`

Pointer to a structure of type 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545384">CO_CALL_PARAMETERS</a>, supplied by the call
     manager, specifying the call and media parameters for the VC activation.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

A connection-oriented miniport driver must call 
    <b>NdisMCoActivateVcComplete</b> if its 
    <i>MiniportCoActivateVc</i> function previously returned NDIS_STATUS_PENDING in response to a request to
    activate or reactivate the VC identified by the given 
    <i>NdisVcHandle</i> . The call manager, which initiated the VC activation with a call to 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndiscmactivatevc.md">NdisCmActivateVc</a>, cannot notify NDIS or
    its client whether transfers on the VC can be made using the supplied call parameters until the miniport
    driver calls 
    <b>NdisMCoActivateVcComplete</b>.

If the miniport driver finds the CM-supplied call parameters unacceptable, it fails the VC activation
    when it calls 
    <b>NdisMCoActivateVcComplete</b>. Failing the initial activation of a VC can cause the protocol that
    created the VC to tear it down. If the miniport driver fails a request to reactivate an established VC
    with new call parameters, it must restore the original call parameters established for that VC. Depending
    on the nature of the network medium, a miniport driver can modify the media parameters if the round-up
    and/or round-down flag(s) are set before it calls 
    <b>NdisMCoActivateVcComplete</b>.

A call to 
    <b>NdisMCoActivateVcComplete</b> causes NDIS to call the 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-protocol_cm_activate_vc_complete.md">
    ProtocolCmActivateVcComplete</a> function of the call manager that originally requested the VC
    activation.
