# NdisAllocateFromNPagedLookasideList function
The 
  <b>NdisAllocateFromNPagedLookasideList</b> function removes the first entry from the given lookaside list
  head. If the lookaside list currently is empty, an entry is allocated from nonpaged pool.

## Syntax

````
PVOID NdisAllocateFromNPagedLookasideList(
  [in] PNPAGED_LOOKASIDE_LIST Lookaside
);
````

## Parameters

`_L`

TBD


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

If the lookaside list is not empty, 
    <b>NdisAllocateFromNPagedLookasideList</b> removes the first entry from the list and returns its address
    to the caller. If the lookaside list is empty, 
    <b>NdisAllocateFromNPagedLookasideList</b> either calls the 
    <i>Allocate</i> function, specified in the 
    <i>Allocate</i> parameter of the 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisinitializenpagedlookasidelist.md">
    NdisInitializeNPagedLookasideList</a> function, that the caller specified at list initialization, if
    any, or it allocates an entry on behalf of the caller. 
    <b>NdisAllocateFromNPagedLookasideList</b> returns <b>NULL</b> if the caller-supplied 
    <i>Allocate</i> function, if any, or if this function itself cannot allocate an nonpaged entry.

All entries that are allocated from a nonpaged lookaside list are of a fixed size, that was specified
    when the driver originally called 
    <b>NdisInitializeNPagedLookasideList</b>. Consequently, a lookaside list is particularly useful to
    drivers that must allocate fixed-size blocks in which to maintain state in response to dynamic I/O
    demand. For example, any connection-oriented NDIS driver might allocate the VC context areas that it
    needs from a lookaside list as VCs are created and release each such entry back to the lookaside list
    with the 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisfreetonpagedlookasidelist.md">
    NdisFreeToNPagedLookasideList</a> function as each VC is torn down.
