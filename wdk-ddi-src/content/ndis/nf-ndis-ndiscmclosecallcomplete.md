# NdisCmCloseCallComplete function
<b>NdisCmCloseCallComplete</b> returns the final status of a client's request, for which the call manager
  previously returned NDIS_STATUS_PENDING, to tear down a call.

## Syntax

````
VOID NdisCmCloseCallComplete(
  _In_     NDIS_STATUS Status,
  _In_     NDIS_HANDLE NdisVcHandle,
  _In_opt_ NDIS_HANDLE NdisPartyHandle
);
````

## Parameters

`Status`

Specifies the final status of the client's request that the CM close the connection, either
     NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS or any CM-determined NDIS_STATUS_<i>XXX</i> except NDIS_STATUS_PENDING.

`NdisVcHandle`

Specifies the handle to the VC for the call. This handle was supplied by NDIS when the VC was
     originally created, whether by the call manager or client, with 
     <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndiscocreatevc.md">NdisCoCreateVc</a>. More recently, the call
     manager obtained this handle from its per-VC state designated by the 
     <i>CallMgrVcContext</i> passed as an input parameter to its 
     <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-protocol_cm_close_call.md">
     ProtocolCmCloseCall</a> function.

`NdisPartyHandle`

Specifies either <b>NULL</b> if the 
     <i>NdisVcHandle</i> represents a point-to-point VC or the handle to the last remaining party on a
     multipoint connection, which the CM obtained from its per-party state designated by the 
     <i>CallMgrPartyContext</i> passed as an input parameter to its 
     <i>ProtocolCmCloseCall</i> function.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

If a stand-alone call manager's 
    <i>ProtocolCmCloseCall</i> function returns NDIS_STATUS_PENDING, the CM must call 
    <b>NdisCmCloseCallComplete</b> subsequently to notify the client and NDIS that its attempt to break the
    connection has completed, whether successfully or with an error. A call to 
    <b>NdisCmCloseCallComplete</b> causes NDIS to call the client's 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-protocol_cl_close_call_complete.md">
    ProtocolClCloseCallComplete</a> function.

If it passes NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS as the 
    <i>Status</i>, the call manager should consider the 
    <i>NdisVcHandle</i> (and 
    <i>NdisPartyHandle</i>, if any) unusable for transfers over the network as soon as it calls 
    <b>NdisCmCloseCallComplete</b>. If the call manager originally created the VC, it should call 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndiscodeletevc.md">NdisCoDeleteVc</a> with the same 
    <i>NdisVcHandle</i> that it just passed to 
    <b>NdisCmCloseCallComplete</b>. If the client created this VC, the call manager can expect a call to its 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-protocol_co_delete_vc.md">ProtocolCoDeleteVc</a> function with the
    
    <i>ProtocolVcContext</i>, where it has the same 
    <i>NdisVcHandle</i>, as an input parameter.

Only stand-alone call managers, which register themselves with NDIS as protocol drivers, can call 
    <b>NdisCmCloseCallComplete</b>. Connection-oriented miniport drivers that provide integrated
    call-management support call 
    <b>NdisMCmCloseCallComplete</b> instead.
