# MINIPORT_CO_CREATE_VC callback



## -description
The 
  <i>MiniportCoCreateVc</i> function is required for connection-oriented miniports. 
  <i>MiniportCoCreateVc</i> is called by NDIS to indicate to the miniport driver that a
  new VC is being created.



## -prototype

````
MINIPORT_CO_CREATE_VC MiniportCoCreateVc;

NDIS_STATUS MiniportCoCreateVc(
  _In_  NDIS_HANDLE  MiniportAdapterContext,
  _In_  NDIS_HANDLE  NdisVcHandle,
  _Out_ PNDIS_HANDLE MiniportVcContext
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param MiniportAdapterContext [in]

Specifies the handle to a miniport driver-allocated context area in which the miniport driver
     maintains state information about this instance of the adapter. The miniport driver provided this handle
     to NDIS by calling 
     <a href="netvista.ndismsetminiportattributes">
     NdisMSetMiniportAttributes</a> from its 
     <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-miniport_initialize.md">
     MiniportInitializeEx</a> function.


### -param NdisVcHandle [in]

Specifies a handle, supplied by NDIS, that uniquely identifies the VC being created. This handle
     is opaque to the miniport driver and reserved for NDIS library use.


### -param MiniportVcContext [out]

Specifies, on output, a handle to a miniport driver-supplied context area in which the miniport
     driver maintains state about the VC.


## -returns
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>Indicates that the miniport driver successfully allocated all necessary resources and prepared
       itself for handling requests for the newly created VC.
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_RESOURCES</b></dt>
</dl>Indicates that the call manager could not obtain dynamically allocated resources necessary for
       it to operate on the new VC.

 


## -remarks
<i>MiniportCoCreateVc</i> must be written as a synchronous function and cannot, under
    any circumstances, return NDIS_STATUS_PENDING without causing a system-wide failure.

<i>MiniportCoCreateVc</i> allocates any necessary resources that the miniport driver
    requires to maintain state information about the VC. The resources could include, but are not limited to
    memory buffers, events, data structures, and other such similar resources.

After allocating all required resources the miniport driver should initialize the resources into a
    usable state and return a pointer to the state area in 
    <i>MiniportVcContext</i>. The handle is set by dereferencing the handle and storing a
    pointer to the state buffer as the value of the handle. For example:

Miniport drivers 
    <i>must</i> store the handle to the VC, 
    <i>NdisVcHandle</i>, in their state area as it is a required parameter to other NDIS
    library routines that are subsequently called by the miniport driver.

To define a <i>MiniportCoCreateVc</i> function, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of function you're defining. Windows provides a set of function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the function types helps <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2F3549EF-B50F-455A-BDC7-1F67782B8DCA">Code Analysis for Drivers</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/74feeb16-387c-4796-987a-aff3fb79b556">Static Driver Verifier</a> (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it's a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

For example, to define a <i>MiniportCoCreateVc</i> function that is named "MyCoCreateVc", use the <b>MINIPORT_CO_CREATE_VC</b> type as shown in this code example:

Then, implement your function as follows:

The <b>MINIPORT_CO_CREATE_VC</b> function type is defined in the Ndis.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation to your function definition.  The _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the <b>MINIPORT_CO_CREATE_VC</b> function type in the header file are used.  For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/232c4272-0bf0-4a4e-9560-3bceeca8a3e3">Declaring Functions by Using Function Role Types for NDIS Drivers</a>.

For information about  _Use_decl_annotations_, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=286697">Annotating Function Behavior</a>.
