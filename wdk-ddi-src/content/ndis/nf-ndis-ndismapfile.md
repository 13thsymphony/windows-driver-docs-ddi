# NdisMapFile function
The 
  <b>NdisMapFile</b> function maps an already open file into a caller-accessible buffer if the file is
  currently unmapped.

## Syntax

````
VOID NdisMapFile(
  _Out_ PNDIS_STATUS Status,
  _Out_ PVOID *      MappedBuffer,
  _In_  NDIS_HANDLE  FileHandle
);
````

## Parameters

`Status`

A pointer to a caller-supplied variable in which this function returns the status of the mapping
     operation, which can be one of the following:
     





#### NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS

The caller has exclusive access to the file contents until the 
       <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisunmapfile.md">NdisUnmapFile</a> function is called.



#### NDIS_STATUS_ALREADY_MAPPED

The caller cannot access the file contents at this time.

`MappedBuffer`

A pointer to a caller-supplied variable in which this function returns the base virtual address of
     the mapped file contents or <b>NULL</b>.

`FileHandle`

The handle that was returned by a preceding call to the 
     <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisopenfile.md">NdisOpenFile</a> function.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

<b>NdisMapFile</b> associates (maps) a virtual address range with an opened file so the driver can access
    the file contents. 
    <b>NdisMapFile</b> allows only one mapping of a particular file to be outstanding at any time.
    Consequently, a successful caller is given exclusive access to the file data until 
    <b>NdisUnmapFile</b> or the 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisclosefile.md">NdisCloseFile</a> function is called.

A miniport driver can map and unmap such an open file as necessary, using alternating calls to 
    <b>NdisMapFile</b> and 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisunmapfile.md">NdisUnmapFile</a>. A call to 
    <b>NdisCloseFile</b> releases the 
    <i>FileHandle</i> and deallocates the buffer containing the file contents.

A miniport driver can call 
    <b>NdisMapFile</b> only during initialization.
