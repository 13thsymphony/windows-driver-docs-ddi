# NdisMCmDropPartyComplete function
<b>NdisMCmDropPartyComplete</b> returns the final status of a client's request, for which the MCM driver
  previously returned NDIS_STATUS_PENDING, to remove a party from a multipoint VC.

## Syntax

````
VOID NdisMCmDropPartyComplete(
  [in] NDIS_STATUS Status,
  [in] NDIS_HANDLE NdisPartyHandle
);
````

## Parameters

`_S_`

TBD

`_H_`

TBD


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

An MCM driver must call 
    <b>NdisMCmDropPartyComplete</b> if its 
    <i>ProtocolCmDropParty</i> function previously returned NDIS_STATUS_PENDING for the given 
    <i>NdisPartyHandle</i> . Neither NDIS nor the client, which initiated the pended drop-party operation with
    a call to 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndiscldropparty.md">NdisClDropParty</a>, can release the
    resources they allocated to maintain per-party state until the MCM driver's call to 
    <b>NdisMCmDropPartyComplete</b> causes a call to that client's 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-protocol_cl_drop_party_complete.md">
    ProtocolClDropPartyComplete</a> function.

If it passes NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS for the 
    <i>Status</i>, the MCM driver must consider the 
    <i>NdisPartyHandle</i> invalid when 
    <b>NdisMCmDropPartyComplete</b> returns control. The MCM driver can release (or reinitialize for reuse)
    any resources that it allocated to maintain state for this party after 
    <b>NdisMCmDropPartyComplete</b> returns control.

Only connection-oriented miniport drivers that provide integrated call-management support can call 
    <b>NdisMCmDropPartyComplete</b>. Stand-alone call managers, which register themselves with NDIS as
    protocol drivers, call 
    <b>NdisCmDropPartyComplete</b> instead.
