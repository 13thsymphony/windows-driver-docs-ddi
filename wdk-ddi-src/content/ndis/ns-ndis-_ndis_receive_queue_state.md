# _NDIS_RECEIVE_QUEUE_STATE structure
The <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_QUEUE_STATE</b> structure contains information about the operational state of a receive
  queue.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _NDIS_RECEIVE_QUEUE_STATE {
  NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER                   Header;
  ULONG                                Flags;
  NDIS_RECEIVE_QUEUE_ID                QueueId;
  NDIS_RECEIVE_QUEUE_OPERATIONAL_STATE QueueState;
} NDIS_RECEIVE_QUEUE_STATE, *PNDIS_RECEIVE_QUEUE_STATE;
````

## Members


`Flags`

A <b>ULONG</b> value that contains a bitwise <b>OR</b> of flags. This member is reserved for NDIS.

`Header`

The 
     <a href="..\ntddndis\ns-ntddndis-_ndis_object_header.md">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a> structure for the
     <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_QUEUE_STATE</b>  structure. The driver sets the 
     <b>Type</b> member of the structure that 
     <b>Header</b> specifies to <b>NDIS_OBJECT_TYPE_DEFAULT</b>, the 
     <b>Revision</b> member to <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_QUEUE_STATE_REVISION_1</b>, and the 
     <b>Size</b> member to <b>NDIS_SIZEOF_NDIS_RECEIVE_QUEUE_STATE_REVISION_1</b>.

`QueueId`

An <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_QUEUE_ID</b> type value that contains a queue identifier. The queue identifier is an
     integer value between zero and the number of queues that the network adapter supports. A value of <b>NDIS_DEFAULT_RECEIVE_QUEUE_ID</b> specifies
     the default receive queue.

`QueueState`

An 
     <a href="..\ntddndis\ne-ntddndis-_ndis_receive_queue_operational_state.md">NDIS_RECEIVE_QUEUE_OPERATIONAL_STATE</a> enumeration value that specifies the operational state of the
     receive queue.

## Remarks
The <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_QUEUE_STATE</b> structure is used in the 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff567214">
    NDIS_STATUS_RECEIVE_QUEUE_STATE</a> status indication.

## Requirements
