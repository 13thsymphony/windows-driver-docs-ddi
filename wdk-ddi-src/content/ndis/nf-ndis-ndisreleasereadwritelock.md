# NdisReleaseReadWriteLock function
The 
  <b>NdisReleaseReadWriteLock</b> function releases a lock that was acquired in a preceding call to 
  <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisacquirereadwritelock.md">NdisAcquireReadWriteLock</a>.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The read-write lock interface is deprecated for NDIS 6.20 and later drivers, which should use <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisreleaserwlock.md">NdisReleaseRWLock</a> instead of <b>NdisReleaseReadWriteLock</b>.</div><div> </div>

## Syntax

````
VOID NdisReleaseReadWriteLock(
  _Inout_ PNDIS_RW_LOCK Lock,
  _In_    PLOCK_STATE   LockState
);
````

## Parameters

`Lock`

A pointer to an <a href="..\ndis\ns-ndis-_ndis_rw_lock.md">NDIS_RW_LOCK</a> variable for the acquired lock to be released.

`_Requires_lock_held_`

TBD


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

A driver must initialize a lock before calling any other 
    Ndis<i>Xxx</i>ReadWriteLock function that is used to acquire or release read or write access to the
    resources that are protected by that lock. The 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisinitializereadwritelock.md">NdisInitializeReadWriteLock</a> function is used to initialize a lock.

A driver must call the 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisacquirereadwritelock.md">NdisAcquireReadWriteLock</a> function
    to acquire a lock before the driver can call 
    <b>NdisReleaseReadWriteLock</b>. Each call to 
    <b>NdisAcquireReadWriteLock</b> requires a reciprocal call to 
    <b>NdisReleaseReadWriteLock</b>.

<b>NdisReleaseReadWriteLock</b> restores the original IRQL that was used by its caller before the call to 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisacquirereadwritelock.md">NdisAcquireReadWriteLock</a> was made.
