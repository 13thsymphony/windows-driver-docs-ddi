# _IPSEC_OFFLOAD_V2_DELETE_SA structure
<p class="CCE_Message">[The IPsec Task Offload feature is deprecated and should not be used.]

The IPSEC_OFFLOAD_V2_DELETE_SA structure specifies a security association (SA) that should be deleted
  from a NIC and a pointer to the next IPSEC_OFFLOAD_V2_DELETE_SA structure in a linked list.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _IPSEC_OFFLOAD_V2_DELETE_SA {
  NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER          Header;
  PIPSEC_OFFLOAD_V2_DELETE_SA Next;
  NDIS_HANDLE                 OffloadHandle;
} IPSEC_OFFLOAD_V2_DELETE_SA, *PIPSEC_OFFLOAD_V2_DELETE_SA;
````

## Members


`Header`

The 
     <a href="..\ntddndis\ns-ntddndis-_ndis_object_header.md">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a> structure for the
     IPSEC_OFFLOAD_V2_DELETE_SA structure. Set the 
     <b>Type</b> member of the structure that 
     <b>Header</b> specifies to NDIS_OBJECT_TYPE_DEFAULT, the 
     <b>Revision</b> member to NDIS_IPSEC_OFFLOAD_V2_DELETE_SA_REVISION_1, and the 
     <b>Size</b> member to NDIS_SIZEOF_IPSEC_OFFLOAD_V2_DELETE_SA_REVISION_1.

`Next`

A pointer to an IPSEC_OFFLOAD_V2_DELETE_SA structure that is the next structure in a linked list.
     If the pointer is <b>NULL</b>, the current structure is the last structure in the list.

`OffloadHandle`

An NDIS handle that identifies the SA. The miniport driver provided this handle in response to an 
      OID set request of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/network/oid-tcp-task-ipsec-offload-v2-add-sa">OID_TCP_TASK_IPSEC_OFFLOAD_V2_ADD_SA</a>.

## Remarks
The IPSEC_OFFLOAD_V2_DELETE_SA structure defines a handle for a SA that should be deleted and a
    pointer to the next IPSEC_OFFLOAD_V2_DELETE_SA structure in a linked list. The IPSEC_OFFLOAD_V2_DELETE_SA
    structure is used with the 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/network/oid-tcp-task-ipsec-offload-v2-delete-sa">
    OID_TCP_TASK_IPSEC_OFFLOAD_V2_DELETE_SA</a> OID.

## Requirements
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows version** | Supported in NDIS 6.1 and later. Supported in NDIS 6.1 and later. |
| **Header** | ndis.h (include Ndis.h) |
