# FILTER_DIRECT_OID_REQUEST callback



## -description
NDIS calls a filter driver's 
  <i>FilterDirectOidRequest</i> function to process a direct OID request that is
  associated with the specified filter module.



## -prototype

````
FILTER_DIRECT_OID_REQUEST FilterDirectOidRequest;

NDIS_STATUS FilterDirectOidRequest(
  _In_ NDIS_HANDLE       FilterModuleContext,
  _In_ PNDIS_OID_REQUEST OidRequest
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param FilterModuleContext [in]

A handle to the context area for the filter module that is the target of this request. The filter
     driver created and initialized this context area in the 
     <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-filter_attach.md">FilterAttach</a> function.


### -param OidRequest [in]

A pointer to an 
     <a href="netvista.ndis_oid_request">NDIS_OID_REQUEST</a> structure that specifies
     the operation requested, including the OID_
     <i>Xx</i> code. The structure can specify either a query request or a set
     request


## -returns
<i>FilterDirectOidRequest</i> returns one of the following status values:
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl><i>FilterDirectOidRequest</i> successfully completed the filter driver's query or
       set operation for this filter module.
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_PENDING</b></dt>
</dl>The filter driver will complete the request asynchronously. After the driver completes the
       request, it must call the 
       <a href="netvista.ndisfdirectoidrequestcomplete">
       NdisFDirectOidRequestComplete</a> function to inform NDIS that the request is complete.
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_INVALID_OID</b></dt>
</dl>The request that 
       <i>OidRequest</i> specified was invalid or not recognized.
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED</b></dt>
</dl><i>FilterDirectOidRequest</i> does not support the OID; the OID is optional.
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SHORT</b></dt>
</dl>The buffer that 
       <i>OidRequest</i> supplied was too small to hold the requested data.
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_INVALID_LENGTH</b></dt>
</dl>For a query operation, the 
       <b>InformationBufferLength</b> member of the 
       <a href="netvista.ndis_oid_request">NDIS_OID_REQUEST</a> structure does not
       match the length that the given OID requires. 
       <i>FilterDirectOidRequest</i> returned the required buffer size, in bytes, in the 
       <b>BytesNeeded</b> member of the NDIS_OID_REQUEST structure.
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_INVALID_DATA</b></dt>
</dl>For a set operation, the data that was supplied in the 
       <b>InformationBuffer</b> member of the NDIS_OID_REQUEST structure was invalid for the given OID.
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_NOT_ACCEPTED</b></dt>
</dl><i>FilterDirectOidRequest</i> attempted to gather the requested information but was
       unsuccessful.
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_RESOURCES</b></dt>
</dl><i>FilterDirectOidRequest</i> failed because of insufficient resources.
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_FAILURE</b></dt>
</dl><i>N</i> one of the preceding return values applies. The filter driver should call
       the 
       <a href="netvista.ndiswriteerrorlogentry">NdisWriteErrorLogEntry</a> function
       with parameters that specify the reason for the failure.

 


## -remarks
<i>FilterDirectOidRequest</i> is an optional function. If a filter driver does not use
    direct OID requests, it can set the entry point for this function to <b>NULL</b> when it calls the 
    <b>NdisFRegisterFilterDriver</b> function. If a filter driver defines a 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-filter_direct_oid_request_complete.md">
    FilterDirectOidRequestComplete</a> function, it must provide the 
    <i>FilterDirectOidRequest</i> function.

NDIS calls the filter driver's 
    <i>FilterDirectOidRequest</i> function to process direct OID requests that are
    originated by overlying drivers. Filter drivers can forward such requests to underlying drivers by
    calling the 
    <a href="netvista.ndisfdirectoidrequest">NdisFDirectOidRequest</a> function. As
    an option, a filter driver can also complete a request immediately without forwarding the request.

Before the driver calls 
    <b>NdisFDirectOidRequest</b>, the driver must allocate an 
    <a href="netvista.ndis_oid_request">NDIS_OID_REQUEST</a> structure and transfer the
    request information to the new structure by calling the 
    <a href="netvista.ndisallocatecloneoidrequest">
    NdisAllocateCloneOidRequest</a> function.

To complete a request synchronously, the filter driver returns NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS or a failure
    status. If the driver returns NDIS_STATUS_PENDING, it must call the 
    <a href="netvista.ndisfdirectoidrequestcomplete">
    NdisFDirectOidRequestComplete</a> function to inform NDIS that the request is complete.

For a query operation, 
    <i>FilterDirectOidRequest</i> returns the requested information in the 
    <b>InformationBuffer</b> member and sets the variable in the 
    <b>BytesWritten</b> member of the NDIS_OID_REQUEST structure to the amount of information it returned. The
    underlying drivers do this if the filter driver passed the request on with 
    <b>NdisFDirectOidRequest</b>.

For a set operation
    <i>, FilterDirectOidRequest</i> can use the data in the 
    <b>InformationBuffer</b> member of the NDIS_OID_REQUEST structure to set the information that the given
    OID requires. In this case, 
    <i>FilterDirectOidRequest</i> sets the variable at 
    <b>BytesRead</b> to the amount of the supplied data that it used. The underlying drivers set 
    <b>BytesRead</b> in this way if the filter driver passed the request on with 
    <b>NdisFDirectOidRequest</b>.

NDIS does not serialize requests that it sends to 
    <i>FilterDirectOidRequest</i> with other OID requests. The filter driver must be able
    to handle multiple calls to 
    <i>FilterDirectOidRequest</i> when other requests that are sent to 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-filter_oid_request.md">FilterOidRequest</a> or 
    <i>FilterDirectOidRequest</i> are outstanding.

NDIS calls 
    <i>FilterDirectOidRequest</i> at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL.

To define a <i>FilterDirectOidRequest</i> function, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of function you're defining. Windows provides a set of function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the function types helps <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2F3549EF-B50F-455A-BDC7-1F67782B8DCA">Code Analysis for Drivers</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/74feeb16-387c-4796-987a-aff3fb79b556">Static Driver Verifier</a> (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it's a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

For example, to define a <i>FilterDirectOidRequest</i> function that is named "MyDirectOidRequest", use the <b>FILTER_DIRECT_OID_REQUEST</b> type as shown in this code example:

Then, implement your function as follows:

The <b>FILTER_DIRECT_OID_REQUEST</b> function type is defined in the Ndis.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation to your function definition.  The _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the <b>FILTER_DIRECT_OID_REQUEST</b> function type in the header file are used.  For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/232c4272-0bf0-4a4e-9560-3bceeca8a3e3">Declaring Functions by Using Function Role Types for NDIS Drivers</a>.

For information about  _Use_decl_annotations_, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=286697">Annotating Function Behavior</a>.
