# NdisIMGetBindingContext function
The 
  <b>NdisIMGetBindingContext</b> function allows an NDIS protocol driver to access the device context area,
  which was created by an underlying intermediate driver, for a virtual miniport to which the higher level
  protocol driver is bound.

## Syntax

````
NDIS_HANDLE NdisIMGetBindingContext(
  _In_ NDIS_HANDLE NdisBindingHandle
);
````

## Parameters

`NdisBindingHandle`

The binding handle that the 
     <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisopenadapterex.md">NdisOpenAdapterEx</a> function returned at
     the 
     <i>NdisBindingHandle</i> parameter that identifies the virtual miniport of the next lower intermediate
     driver to which the caller is bound.


## Return Value

<b>NdisIMGetBindingContext</b> returns a handle to the device context area for the given virtual
     miniport, or it returns <b>NULL</b> if no such context area exists.

## Remarks

A protocol driver or intermediate driver can call 
    <b>NdisIMGetBindingContext</b> from its 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-protocol_bind_adapter_ex.md">ProtocolBindAdapterEx</a> function to
    access the device context for a virtual miniport to which it is bound. The device context provides a
    common context area for all overlying protocol drivers that are bound to the same underlying intermediate
    driver.

Such a device context area was allocated and defined by the lower level NDIS intermediate driver and
    passed to NDIS in a call to the 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisiminitializedeviceinstanceex.md">
    NdisIMInitializeDeviceInstanceEx</a> function.

All protocol drivers that call 
    <b>NdisIMGetBindingContext</b> can safely assume that the underlying intermediate driver allocated its
    context area from nonpaged pool. They should treat the returned context area as read-only, preserving the
    state set up by the underlying NDIS intermediate driver that defined it.
