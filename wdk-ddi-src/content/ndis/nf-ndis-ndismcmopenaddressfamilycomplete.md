# NdisMCmOpenAddressFamilyComplete function
<b>NdisMCmOpenAddressFamilyComplete</b> returns the final status of a client's request, for which the MCM
  driver's 
  <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-protocol_cm_open_af.md">ProtocolCmOpenAf</a> function returned
  NDIS_STATUS_PENDING, to open the MCM driver's address family.

## Syntax

````
VOID NdisMCmOpenAddressFamilyComplete(
  [in] NDIS_STATUS Status,
  [in] NDIS_HANDLE NdisAfHandle,
  [in] NDIS_HANDLE CallMgrAfContext
);
````

## Parameters

`_S_`

TBD

`_H_`

TBD

`_C_`

TBD


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

An MCM driver must call 
    <b>NdisMCmOpenAddressFamilyComplete</b> if its 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-protocol_cm_open_af.md">ProtocolCmOpenAf</a> function previously
    returned NDIS_STATUS_PENDING for the given 
    <i>NdisAfHandle</i> . The client, which initiated the pended open-AF operation with a call to 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisclopenaddressfamilyex.md">NdisClOpenAddressFamilyEx</a>,
    cannot carry out further connection-oriented operations on the same binding until 
    <b>NdisMCmOpenAddressFamilyComplete</b> causes a call to that client's 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-protocol_cl_open_af_complete_ex.md">
    ProtocolClOpenAfCompleteEx</a> function.

If the caller of 
    <b>NdisMCmOpenAddressFamilyComplete</b> sets 
    <i>Status</i> to NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS, NDIS subsequently passes the given 
    <i>CallMgrAfContext</i> handle as an input parameter to all MCM driver-supplied ProtocolCm<i>Xxx</i> and ProtocolCo<i>Xxx</i> functions that concern the client's open of the address family until the client closes the AF.
    The MCM driver should release or reuse any AF context area that it allocated before it passes a failure
    status to 
    <b>NdisMCmOpenAddressFamilyComplete</b>.

For a successful open, the NDIS-supplied 
    <i>NdisAfHandle</i> represents an association between the MCM driver and client for the opened AF. Both
    NDIS drivers must treat 
    <i>NdisAfHandle</i> as an opaque variable to be passed, unmodified and uninterpreted, in subsequent calls
    to NdisCl/Co/MCm/MCoXxx functions for which this handle is a required parameter. For a failed open, the
    MCM driver should consider the 
    <i>NdisAfHandle</i> invalid when 
    <b>NdisMCmOpenAddressFamilyComplete</b> returns control.

Only connection-oriented miniport drivers that provide integrated call-management support can call 
    <b>NdisMCmOpenAddressFamilyComplete</b>. Stand-alone call managers, which register themselves with NDIS
    as protocol drivers, call 
    <b>NdisCmOpenAddressFamilyComplete</b> instead.
