# NdisMFreeSharedMemory function
<b>NdisMFreeSharedMemory</b> frees memory that was previously allocated by 
  <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndismallocatesharedmemory.md">NdisMAllocateSharedMemory</a> or 
  <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndismallocatesharedmemoryasyncex.md">
  NdisMAllocateSharedMemoryAsyncEx</a> by the driver of a DMA NIC.

## Syntax

````
VOID NdisMFreeSharedMemory(
  _In_ NDIS_HANDLE           MiniportAdapterHandle,
  _In_ ULONG                 Length,
  _In_ BOOLEAN               Cached,
  _In_ PVOID                 VirtualAddress,
  _In_ NDIS_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS PhysicalAddress
);
````

## Parameters

`MiniportAdapterHandle`

Specifies the handle originally input to 
     <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-miniport_initialize.md">MiniportInitializeEx</a>.

`Length`

Specifies the number of bytes originally allocated.

`Cached`

Specifies <b>TRUE</b> if the original allocation was cacheable.

`VirtualAddress`

Specifies the base virtual address returned by 
     <b>NdisMAllocateSharedMemory</b> or 
     <b>NdisMAllocateSharedMemoryAsyncEx</b>.

`PhysicalAddress`

Specifies the corresponding physical address returned by 
     <b>NdisMAllocateSharedMemory</b> or 
     <b>NdisMAllocateSharedMemoryAsyncEx</b>.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

If it has already made a successful call to 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndismallocatesharedmemory.md">NdisMAllocateSharedMemory</a> or 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndismallocatesharedmemoryasyncex.md">
    NdisMAllocateSharedMemoryAsyncEx</a>, the miniport driver of a DMA device calls 
    <b>NdisMFreeSharedMemory</b> if any of the following occurs:
<ul>
<li>
Its 
      <i>MiniportInitializeEx</i> function is unable to initialize the NIC, so this function must release all
      existing claims on hardware resources for that NIC before it returns control.

</li>
<li>
The NIC for which the miniport driver allocated the memory is being removed.

</li>
<li>
The driver is being unloaded, whether because the system is shutting down or because the user
      reconfigured the network components used in the machine.

</li>
<li>
The driver allocated additional shared memory with 
      <b>NdisMAllocateSharedMemoryAsyncEx</b> when I/O demand on a NIC was high but network traffic has now
      subsided to an average level.

</li>
</ul>A miniport driver cannot call 
    <b>NdisMFreeSharedMemory</b> to free a subrange within an allocated shared memory range. The parameters
    passed to 
    <b>NdisMFreeSharedMemory</b> must match exactly those that were passed to 
    <b>NdisMAllocateSharedMemory</b> or 
    <b>NdisMAllocateSharedMemoryAsyncEx</b>.

<b>NdisMFreeSharedMemory</b> cannot be called from a 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-miniport_shutdown.md">MiniportShutdownEx</a> function.

Microsoft Windows Server 2003, Windows XP Service Pack 1, and later versions of Windows allow both
    bus-master DMA NICs and subordinate DMA NICs to call 
    <b>NdisMFreeSharedMemory</b>. Prior releases allow only bus-master DMA NICs to call 
    <b>NdisMFreeSharedMemory</b>.
