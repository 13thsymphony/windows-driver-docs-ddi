# NdisGetHypervisorInfo function


## Syntax

````
NDIS_STATUS NdisGetHypervisorInfo(
  _Inout_ PNDIS_HYPERVISOR_INFO HypervisorInfo
);
````

## Parameters

`HypervisorInfo`

A pointer to a caller-allocated <a href="..\ntddndis\ns-ntddndis-_ndis_hypervisor_info.md">NDIS_HYPERVISOR_INFO</a> structure that
     contains information about the hypervisor that is present on the system.


## Return Value

<b>NdisGetHypervisorInfo</b> can return one of the following status values:
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>The operation completed successfully.
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SHORT</b></dt>
</dl>The size of the input parameter buffer was too small.

## Remarks

NDIS miniport drivers call the 
    <b>NdisGetHypervisorInfo</b> function to determine whether a hypervisor is present on the system.

When the <b>NdisGetHypervisorInfo</b> function returns, the <i>HypervisorInfo</i> parameter contains a pointer to an <a href="..\ntddndis\ns-ntddndis-_ndis_hypervisor_info.md">NDIS_HYPERVISOR_INFO</a> structure. This structure contains information about whether a hypervisor is present, along with the partition type from which this function was called. The <b>NDIS_HYPERVISOR_INFO</b> structure provides this information in the following way:

If a hypervisor is present, the <b>NDIS_HYPERVISOR_INFO_FLAG_HYPERVISOR_PRESENT</b> 
flag is set in the <b>Flags</b> member.

If the Microsoft hypervisor is present, the <b>PartitionType</b> member is set to one of the following values: 

If the <b>NdisGetHypervisorInfo</b> function was called from the management operating system that runs in the Hyper-V parent partition, the <b>PartitionType</b> member is set to <b>NdisHypervisorPartitionTypeMsHvParent</b>.

If the <b>NdisGetHypervisorInfo</b> function was called from the guest operating system that runs in the Hyper-V child partition, the <b>PartitionType</b> member is set to <b>NdisHypervisorPartitionMsHvChild</b>.

If another vendor's hypervisor is present, the <b>PartitionType</b> member is set to  <b>NdisHypervisorPartitionTypeUnknown</b>.
