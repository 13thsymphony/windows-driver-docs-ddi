# NdisMGetVirtualFunctionLocation function



## -description
A miniport driver calls the <b>NdisMGetVirtualFunctionLocation</b> function to query the device location of a PCI Express (PCIe) Virtual Function (VF) on a  PCI bus. The driver uses the device location to construct the PCIe Requestor ID (RID) for the VF.



## -syntax

````
VOID NdisMGetVirtualFunctionLocation(
  _In_  NDIS_HANDLE            NdisMiniportHandle,
  _In_  NDIS_SRIOV_FUNCTION_ID VFId,
  _Out_ PUSHORT                SegmentNumber,
  _Out_ PUCHAR                 BusNumber,
  _Out_ PUCHAR                 FunctionNumber
);
````


## -parameters

### -param NdisMiniportHandle [in]

The network adapter handle that NDIS passed to the 
     <i>MiniportAdapterHandle</i> parameter of 
     <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-miniport_initialize.md">MiniportInitializeEx</a>.


### -param VFId [in]

The identifier of the VF for which the device location is returned.


### -param SegmentNumber [out]

A pointer to a caller-supplied variable in which this function returns a USHORT value for the current PCI segment number. This value specifies the group of PCI buses on which the device is attached.


### -param BusNumber [out]

A pointer to a caller-supplied variable in which this function returns a UCHAR value. This value specifies the current PCI bus number on which the device is attached.


### -param FunctionNumber [out]

A pointer to a caller-supplied variable in which this function returns a UCHAR value. This value specifies the function number of a logical device on the device.


## -returns

     None.


## -remarks
 When  it handles a method request of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451814">OID_NIC_SWITCH_ALLOCATE_VF</a>, the PF miniport driver must return the RID for the VF that the driver has successfully allocated on the network adapter. The driver generates the RID in the following way:<ol>
<li>
The driver first calls the  <b>NdisMGetVirtualFunctionLocation</b> function to obtain the bus-related location information for the VF.

</li>
<li>
The driver then calls the  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451557">NDIS_MAKE_RID</a> macro with the bus-related location information to generate the RID.

</li>
</ol>


The driver first calls the  <b>NdisMGetVirtualFunctionLocation</b> function to obtain the bus-related location information for the VF.

The driver then calls the  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451557">NDIS_MAKE_RID</a> macro with the bus-related location information to generate the RID.

For more information on how to allocate VF resources, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/352E12EC-FAF0-4566-8632-B6DA97ACCAD9">Virtual Function Initialization Sequence</a>.

For more information about the SR-IOV interface, see 	<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/B241F468-F568-4500-9356-E576CEBA8F3B">Overview of Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV)</a>.

If an independent hardware vendor (IHV) provides a virtual bus driver (VBD) as part of its SR-IOV <a href="devinst.driver_packages">driver package</a>, its miniport driver must not call <b>NdisMGetVirtualFunctionLocation</b>. Instead, the driver must interface with the VBD through a private communication channel, and request that the VBD call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451128">GetLocation</a>. This function is exposed from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451143">GUID_PCI_VIRTUALIZATION_INTERFACE</a> interface supported by the underlying PCI bus driver.

The VBD that runs in the Hyper-V parent partition's management operating system can query the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451143">GUID_PCI_VIRTUALIZATION_INTERFACE</a> interface by issuing an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551687">IRP_MN_QUERY_INTERFACE</a> request to its physical device object (PDO) on the PCI bus. This request must be made from IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL. In this request, the driver must  set the <i>InterfaceType</i> parameter to GUID_PCI_VIRTUALIZATION_INTERFACE.
