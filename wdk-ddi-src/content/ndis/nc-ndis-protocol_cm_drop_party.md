# PROTOCOL_CM_DROP_PARTY function
The 
  <i>ProtocolCmDropParty</i> function is required. NDIS calls 
  <i>ProtocolCmDropParty</i> to request that the call manager remove a party from an existing multipoint
  call.

## Syntax

```
PROTOCOL_CM_DROP_PARTY ProtocolCmDropParty;

NDIS_STATUS ProtocolCmDropParty(
  NDIS_HANDLE CallMgrPartyContext,
  PVOID CloseData,
  UINT Size
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`CallMgrPartyContext`

Specifies the handle to a call manager-allocated context area in which the call manager maintains
     its per-party state. This handle was provided to NDIS in the call managers 
     <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-protocol_cm_add_party.md">ProtocolCmAddParty</a> function.

`CloseData`

Pointer to a buffer containing connection-oriented client-specific data that should be sent across
     the connection before the party is dropped. This parameter is <b>NULL</b> if the underlying network medium does
     not support transfers of data when closing a connection.

`Size`

Specifies the length, in bytes, of the buffer at 
     <i>CloseData</i>, zero if 
     <i>CloseData</i> is <b>NULL</b>.


## Return Value

<i>ProtocolCmDropParty</i> returns the status of its operation(s) as one of the following values:
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>Indicates that the call manager has successfully dropped the party, sent any close data, and
       free the resources that were allocated for its context area.
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_PENDING</b></dt>
</dl>Indicates that the call manager will complete the request to drop the party asynchronously. The
       call manager must call 
       <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndiscmdroppartycomplete.md">NdisCmDropPartyComplete</a> when
       all processing has been finished to notify NDIS and the requesting actor that the party has been
       dropped.
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_INVALID_DATA</b></dt>
</dl>Indicates that 
       <i>CloseData</i> was specified to the call manager, but the media type does not support sending data
       concurrent with connection termination.

## Remarks

<i>ProtocolCmDropParty</i> communicates with network control devices or other media-specific agents, as
    necessary for its media, to drop a party from an existing multipoint call. If the call manager is
    required to communicated with network control agents (such as, a networking switch) it should use a
    virtual connection to the network control agents that it established in its 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-protocol_bind_adapter_ex.md">
    ProtocolBindAdapterEx</a> function.

If 
    <i>CloseData</i> is non-<b>NULL</b> and sending data at connection termination is supported by its media type,
    the call manager should transmit the data specified at 
    <i>CloseData</i> before completing termination. If sending data concurrent with connection termination is
    not supported by the media type, the call manager should return control with
    NDIS_STATUS_INVALID_DATA.

Call managers must also free any per-party resources that it allocated and stored at 
    <i>CallMgrPartyContext</i> . In addition, the call manager must free the buffer stored 
    <i>CallMgrPartyContext</i> itself. Failure to do so will result in a memory leak condition.

To define a <i>ProtocolCmDropParty</i> function, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of function you're defining. Windows provides a set of function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the function types helps <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2F3549EF-B50F-455A-BDC7-1F67782B8DCA">Code Analysis for Drivers</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/74feeb16-387c-4796-987a-aff3fb79b556">Static Driver Verifier</a> (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it's a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

For example, to define a <i>ProtocolCmDropParty</i> function that is named "MyCmDropParty", use the <b>PROTOCOL_CM_DROP_PARTY</b> type as shown in this code example:

Then, implement your function as follows:

The <b>PROTOCOL_CM_DROP_PARTY</b> function type is defined in the Ndis.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation to your function definition.  The _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the <b>PROTOCOL_CM_DROP_PARTY</b> function type in the header file are used.  For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/232c4272-0bf0-4a4e-9560-3bceeca8a3e3">Declaring Functions by Using Function Role Types for NDIS Drivers</a>.

For information about  _Use_decl_annotations_, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=286697">Annotating Function Behavior</a>.
