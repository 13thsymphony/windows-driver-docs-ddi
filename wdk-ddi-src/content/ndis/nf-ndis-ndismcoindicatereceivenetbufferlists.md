# NdisMCoIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists function
The 
  <b>NdisMCoIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists</b> function indicates that the miniport driver received data from
  the network.

## Syntax

````
VOID NdisMCoIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists(
  _In_ NDIS_HANDLE      NdisVcHandle,
  _In_ PNET_BUFFER_LIST NetBufferLists,
  _In_ ULONG            NumberOfNetBufferLists,
  _In_ ULONG            CoReceiveFlags
);
````

## Parameters

`NdisVcHandle`

A handle that identifies a virtual connection (VC). The miniport driver obtained this handle as an
     input parameter to its 
     <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-miniport_co_create_vc.md">MiniportCoCreateVc</a> function, either
     when a client set up an outgoing call or when the call manager created a VC for a client-registered
     service access point (SAP) to indicate an incoming-call notification on.

`NetBufferLists`

A linked list of 
     <a href="..\ndis\ns-ndis-_net_buffer_list.md">NET_BUFFER_LIST</a> structures that the
     miniport driver allocated.

`NumberOfNetBufferLists`

The number of NET_BUFFER_LIST structures that are in the linked list of structures that 
     <i>NetBufferLists</i> specifies.

`CoReceiveFlags`

Flags that define attributes for the send operation. The flags can be combined with a bitwise OR
     operation. To clear all of the flags, set this parameter to zero. 
     <b>NdisMCoIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists</b> supports the following flags:
     





#### NDIS_RECEIVE_FLAGS_DISPATCH_LEVEL

The current IRQL is DISPATCH_LEVEL. For more information about this flag, see 
       <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ac559f4f-0138-4b9a-8f1b-44a2973fd6a1">Dispatch IRQL Tracking</a>.



#### NDIS_RECEIVE_FLAGS_RESOURCES

The miniport driver reclaims ownership of the NET_BUFFER_LIST structures and any attached
       NET_BUFFER structures immediately after 
       <b>NdisMCoIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists</b> returns.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

A miniport driver typically calls the 
    <b>NdisMCoIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists</b> function from its 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-miniport_interrupt_dpc.md">MiniportInterruptDPC</a> function.
    When a miniport driver calls 
    <b>NdisMCoIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists</b>, it specifies a list of 
    <a href="..\ndis\ns-ndis-_net_buffer_list.md">NET_BUFFER_LIST</a> structures at the 
    <i>NetBufferLists</i> parameter. NDIS then passes the NET_BUFFER_LIST structures to bound protocol drivers.

Miniport drivers must set the 
    <b>SourceHandle</b> member of each NET_BUFFER_LIST structure to the same value as the 
    <i>NdisVcHandle</i> parameter so that NDIS can return the NET_BUFFER_LIST structures to the correct
    miniport driver.

If a miniport driver calls 
    <b>NdisMCoIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists</b> and clears the NDIS_RECEIVE_FLAGS_RESOURCES flag in the 
    <i>CoReceiveFlags</i> parameter, NDIS returns the NET_BUFFER_LIST structures that 
    <i>NetBufferLists</i> specifies to the miniport driver's 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-miniport_return_net_buffer_lists.md">
    MiniportReturnNetBufferLists</a> function. In this case, the miniport driver must not reclaim the
    NET_BUFFER_LIST structures until NDIS returns the NET_BUFFER_LIST structures to the miniport driver's 
    <i>MiniportReturnNetBufferLists</i> function.

If a miniport driver calls 
    <b>NdisMCoIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists</b> and sets the NDIS_RECEIVE_FLAGS_RESOURCES flag in the 
    <i>CoReceiveFlags</i> parameter, the miniport driver must regain ownership of the NET_BUFFER_LIST
    structures immediately. In this case, NDIS does not call the miniport driver's 
    <i>MiniportReturnNetBufferLists</i> function to return the NET_BUFFER_LIST structures. Instead, NDIS
    returns the NET_BUFFER_LIST structures to the miniport driver when 
    <b>NdisMCoIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists</b> returns. The miniport driver should reclaim the
    NET_BUFFER_LIST structures immediately after 
    <b>NdisMCoIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists</b> returns. To reclaim the NET_BUFFER_LIST structures, a miniport
    driver can call its own 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-miniport_return_net_buffer_lists.md">
    MiniportReturnNetBufferLists</a> function.

If a miniport driver sets the NDIS_RECEIVE_FLAGS_RESOURCES flag in the 
    <i>CoReceiveFlags</i> parameter, the protocol drivers must copy the network data and release the
    NET_BUFFER_LIST structures to the miniport driver. You should design your miniport drivers with enough
    preallocated NET_BUFFER_LIST structures to avoid unnecessary copying.

The caller of 
    <b>NdisMCoIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists</b> must properly initialize the NET_BUFFER_LIST structures, the
    attached 
    <a href="..\ndis\ns-ndis-_net_buffer.md">NET_BUFFER</a> structures, and any attached memory
    descriptor lists (MDLs).
