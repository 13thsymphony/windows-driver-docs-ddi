# PROTOCOL_CM_DEREGISTER_SAP callback



## -description
The 
  <i>ProtocolCmDeregisterSap</i> function is required. This function is called by NDIS to request that a call
  manager deregister a SAP on behalf of a connection-oriented client.



## -prototype

````
PROTOCOL_CM_DEREGISTER_SAP ProtocolCmDeregisterSap;

NDIS_STATUS ProtocolCmDeregisterSap(
  _In_ NDIS_HANDLE CallMgrSapContext
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param CallMgrSapContext [in]

Specifies the handle to a call manager-allocated context area in which the call manager maintains
     its per-SAP state information. The call manager supplied this handle to NDIS from its 
     <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-protocol_cm_reg_sap.md">
     ProtocolCmRegisterSap</a> function.


## -returns
<i>ProtocolCmDeregisterSap</i> returns the status of its operation(s) as one of the following:
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>Indicates that the call manager successfully removed the SAP registration and freed any
       resources allocated to maintain per-SAP information.
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_PENDING</b></dt>
</dl>Indicates that the call manager will complete the request to deregister the SAP asynchronously.
       The call manager must call 
       <a href="netvista.ndiscmderegistersapcomplete">
       NdisCmDeregisterSapComplete</a> to signal NDIS when the operation is complete.

 


## -remarks
<i>ProtocolCmDeregisterSap</i> communicates with network control devices or other media-specific agents,
    as necessary, to deregister the SAP on the network. Such actions could include, but are not limited
    to:

Communicating with a switching hardware

Communicating with a network control station

Communicating with other media-specific network agents

If a call manager is required to communicate with networking control agents, such as a network switch,
    it should use a virtual connection to the network control agent that it established in its 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-protocol_bind_adapter_ex.md">ProtocolBindAdapterEx</a> function.
    Stand-alone call managers communicate through the underlying miniport driver by calling 
    <a href="netvista.ndiscosendnetbufferlists">NdisCoSendNetBufferLists</a>.
    Miniport drivers that provide integrated call-management support never call 
    <b>NdisCoSendNetBufferLists</b>. Instead, they transmit the data directly across the network.

In addition, 
    <i>ProtocolCmDeregisterSap</i> must free any dynamically-allocated resources in its per-SAP area, provided
    at 
    <i>CallMgrSapContext</i>, as well as freeing the state area itself before returning control to NDIS.

To define a <i>ProtocolCmDeregisterSap</i> function, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of function you're defining. Windows provides a set of function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the function types helps <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2F3549EF-B50F-455A-BDC7-1F67782B8DCA">Code Analysis for Drivers</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/74feeb16-387c-4796-987a-aff3fb79b556">Static Driver Verifier</a> (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it's a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

For example, to define a <i>ProtocolCmDeregisterSap</i> function that is named "MyCmDeregisterSap", use the <b>PROTOCOL_CM_DEREGISTER_SAP</b> type as shown in this code example:

Then, implement your function as follows:

The <b>PROTOCOL_CM_DEREGISTER_SAP</b> function type is defined in the Ndis.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation to your function definition.  The _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the <b>PROTOCOL_CM_DEREGISTER_SAP</b> function type in the header file are used.  For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/232c4272-0bf0-4a4e-9560-3bceeca8a3e3">Declaring Functions by Using Function Role Types for NDIS Drivers</a>.

For information about  _Use_decl_annotations_, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=286697">Annotating Function Behavior</a>.
