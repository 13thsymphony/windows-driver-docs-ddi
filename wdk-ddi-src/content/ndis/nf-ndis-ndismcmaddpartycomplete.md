# NdisMCmAddPartyComplete function
<b>NdisMCmAddPartyComplete</b> returns the final status of a client's request, for which the MCM driver
  previously returned NDIS_STATUS_PENDING, to add a party on an established multipoint VC.

## Syntax

````
VOID NdisMCmAddPartyComplete(
  [in]           NDIS_STATUS         Status,
  [in]           NDIS_HANDLE         NdisPartyHandle,
  [in, optional] NDIS_HANDLE         CallMgrPartyContext,
  [in]           PCO_CALL_PARAMETERS CallParameters
);
````

## Parameters

`_S_`



`_H_`



`_C_`



`_P_`




## Return Value

None

## Remarks

If an MCM driver's 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-protocol_cm_add_party.md">ProtocolCmAddParty</a> function returns
    NDIS_STATUS_PENDING, the driver must call 
    <b>NdisMCmAddPartyComplete</b> subsequently to notify the client and NDIS that its attempt to add a party
    on the multipoint VC has completed, whether successfully or with an MCM driver-determined error
    status.

The underlying network medium determines whether a client can specify per-party traffic parameters on
    a multipoint VC.

If the underlying network medium does not support per-party traffic parameters on multipoint VCs, an
    MCM driver can do one of the following whenever a client attempts to add a party with a specification at 
    <i>CallParameters</i> that does not match the already established traffic parameters for that VC:

Reset the traffic parameters to those already established for the multipoint VC when it successfully
      adds the party on that VC.

Change the traffic parameters for every party already on the VC when it successfully adds the new
      party.

Reject the request to add a new party. (This alternative implicitly forces clients to set up their
      traffic parameters for a multipoint VC with 
      <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisclmakecall.md">NdisClMakeCall</a> and to specify the same
      traffic parameters at each subsequent call to 
      <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndiscladdparty.md">NdisClAddParty</a> for the given multipoint
      VC.)

If the MCM driver sets 
    <i>Status</i> to NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS, it must supply an explicit handle, which is usually a pointer to the
    driver-allocated per-party state area, as 
    <i>CallMgrPartyContext</i> when it calls 
    <b>NdisMCmAddPartyComplete</b>.

A call to 
    <b>NdisMCmAddPartyComplete</b> causes NDIS to call the client's 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-protocol_cl_add_party_complete.md">
    ProtocolClAddPartyComplete</a> function.

Only connection-oriented miniport drivers that provide integrated call-management support can call 
    <b>NdisMCmAddPartyComplete</b>. Stand-alone call managers, which register themselves with NDIS as
    protocol drivers, call 
    <b>NdisCmAddPartyComplete</b> instead.
