# NdisCmDropPartyComplete function
<b>NdisCmDropPartyComplete</b> returns the final status of a client's request, for which the call manager
  previously returned NDIS_STATUS_PENDING, to remove a party from a multipoint VC.

## Syntax

````
VOID NdisCmDropPartyComplete(
  _In_ NDIS_STATUS Status,
  _In_ NDIS_HANDLE NdisPartyHandle
);
````

## Parameters

`Status`

Specifies the final status of the requested operation, either NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS or any
     CM-determined NDIS_STATUS_
     <i>XXX</i> except NDIS_STATUS_PENDING.

`NdisPartyHandle`

Specifies the handle to the party that the client requested to be dropped. The call manager
     obtained this handle from the state area designated by 
     <i>CallMgrPartyContext</i> that was passed as an input parameter to its 
     <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-protocol_cm_drop_party.md">
     ProtocolCmDropParty</a> function.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

A stand-alone call manager must call 
    <b>NdisCmDropPartyComplete</b> if its 
    <i>ProtocolCmDropParty</i> function previously returned NDIS_STATUS_PENDING for the given 
    <i>NdisPartyHandle</i> . Neither NDIS nor the client, which initiated the pended drop-party operation with
    a call to 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndiscldropparty.md">NdisClDropParty</a>, can release the
    resources they allocated to maintain per-party state until the CM's call to 
    <b>NdisCmDropPartyComplete</b> causes a call to that client's 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-protocol_cl_drop_party_complete.md">
    ProtocolClDropPartyComplete</a> function.

If it passes NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS for the 
    <i>Status</i>, the call manager should consider the 
    <i>NdisPartyHandle</i> invalid as soon as it calls 
    <b>NdisCmDropPartyComplete</b>. The CM can release (or reinitialize for reuse) any resources that it
    allocated to maintain state for this party when 
    <b>NdisCmDropPartyComplete</b> returns control.

Only stand-alone call managers, which register themselves with NDIS as protocol drivers, can call 
    <b>NdisCmDropPartyComplete</b>. Connection-oriented miniport drivers that provide integrated
    call-management support call 
    <b>NdisMCmDropPartyComplete</b> instead.
