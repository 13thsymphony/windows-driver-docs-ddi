# NdisDprAcquireReadWriteLock function
The 
  <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisacquirereadwritelock.md">NdisDprAcquireReadWriteLock</a> function acquires a lock that the caller uses for either write or read
  access to the resources that are shared among driver threads.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The read-write lock interface is deprecated for NDIS 6.20 and later drivers, which should use <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisacquirerwlockread.md">NdisAcquireRWLockRead</a> or <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisacquirerwlockwrite.md">NdisAcquireRWLockWrite</a> (setting <b>NDIS_RWL_AT_DISPATCH_LEVEL</b> in the <i>Flags</i> parameter) instead of <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisacquirereadwritelock.md">NdisDprAcquireReadWriteLock</a>.</div><div> </div>

## Syntax

````
VOID NdisDprAcquireReadWriteLock(
  _Inout_ PNDIS_RW_LOCK Lock,
  _In_    BOOLEAN       fWrite,
  _Out_   PLOCK_STATE   LockState
);
````

## Parameters

`Lock`

A pointer to an opaque variable that represents a lock. The caller can use this lock to access
     shared resources.

`fWrite`

A Boolean value. If the value is TRUE, this function is provided with write access to shared
     resources; if the value is FALSE, this function is provided with read access.

`Arg1`




## Return Value

None

## Remarks

The driver must initialize a variable of type <a href="..\ndis\ns-ndis-_ndis_rw_lock.md">NDIS_RW_LOCK</a> using the 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisinitializereadwritelock.md">
    NdisInitializeReadWriteLock</a> function before the driver calls any other 
    Ndis<i>Xxx</i>ReadWriteLock function. The driver must provide resident storage for the locks it uses.

After acquiring a lock by using 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisacquirereadwritelock.md">NdisDprAcquireReadWriteLock</a>, the caller must release that lock by calling the 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisreleasereadwritelock.md">NdisDprReleaseReadWriteLock</a> function. To decrement the reference count of the lock, a driver must call
    
    <b>NdisDprReleaseReadWriteLock</b> once for each call to 
    <b>NdisDprAcquireReadWriteLock</b>.

It is safe to use both <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisacquirereadwritelock.md">NdisDprAcquireReadWriteLock</a> and <b>NdisDprAcquireReadWriteLock</b> on the same lock.  However, calls must be balanced so that if the lock is acquired with <b>NdisDprAcquireReadWriteLock</b>, it must be released with <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisreleasereadwritelock.md">NdisDprReleaseReadWriteLock</a>.  Likewise, if the lock is acquired with <b>NdisAcquireReadWriteLock</b>, it must be released with <b>NdisReleaseReadWriteLock</b>.

With some architectures, <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisacquirereadwritelock.md">NdisDprAcquireReadWriteLock</a>     performs faster than <b>NdisAcquireReadWriteLock</b>.  Drivers can use <b>NdisDprAcquireReadWriteLock</b>  rather than  <b>NdisAcquireReadWriteLock</b> when it is certain that the current IRQL is already <b>DISPATCH_LEVEL</b>.  However, it is not required.  The overhead of calling the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-kegetcurrentirql.md">KeGetCurrentIrql</a> function is greater than the performance advantage of calling <b>NdisDprAcquireReadWriteLock</b> rather than <b>NdisAcquireReadWriteLock</b>.

To modify resources that are shared among driver threads, a driver thread must acquire a write lock.
    To simply monitor those resources, a driver thread must acquire a read-only lock. Read access does not
    require interlocked operations or contention for spin locks. Using read-only access helps to maintain
    good operating system and driver performance.

A driver thread should never hold a write lock for more than 25 microseconds. Holding a write lock for
    a prolonged period degrades both operating system and driver performance.

The driver cannot use a lock to protect resources from read or write access that its other functions
    share with the 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-miniport_isr.md">MiniportInterrupt</a> and/or 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-miniport_disable_interrupt.md">
    MiniportDisableInterruptEx</a> functions. Instead, the driver must call 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndismsynchronizewithinterruptex.md">NdisMSynchronizeWithInterruptEx</a> so that its 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-miniport_synchronize_interrupt.md">
    MiniportSynchronizeInterrupt</a> function accesses such shared resources at the same DIRQL at which its
    
    <i>MiniportInterrupt</i> and/or 
    <i>
    MiniportDisableInterruptEx</i> functions do.

    and Notification in Network Drivers</a>.
