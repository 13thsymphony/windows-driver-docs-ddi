# NdisMCmCloseCallComplete function
<b>NdisMCmCloseCallComplete</b> returns the final status of a client's request, for which the MCM driver
  previously returned NDIS_STATUS_PENDING, to tear down a call.

## Syntax

```
void NdisMCmCloseCallComplete(
   _S_,
   _VH_,
   _PH_
);
```

## Parameters

`_S_`

TBD

`_VH_`

TBD

`_PH_`

TBD


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

If an MCM driver's 
    <i>ProtocolCmCloseCall</i> function returns NDIS_STATUS_PENDING, it must call 
    <b>NdisMCmCloseCallComplete</b> subsequently to notify the client and NDIS that its attempt to break the
    connection has completed, whether successfully or with an error. A call to 
    <b>NdisMCmCloseCallComplete</b> causes NDIS to call the client's 
    <i>ProtocolClCloseCallComplete</i> function.

If it passes NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS as the 
    <i>Status</i>, the MCM driver should consider the 
    <i>NdisVcHandle</i> (and 
    <i>NdisPartyHandle</i>, if any) unusable for transfers over the network as soon as it calls 
    <b>NdisMCmCloseCallComplete</b>. If the MCM driver originally created the VC, it should call 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff562819">NdisMCmDeleteVc</a> with the same 
    <i>NdisVcHandle</i> that it just passed to 
    <b>NdisMCmCloseCallComplete</b>. If the client created this VC, the MCM driver can expect a call to its 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/d761270f-bf77-441e-834c-9ac7fb3d350f">ProtocolCoDeleteVc</a> function with the
    
    <i>ProtocolVcContext</i>, designating its per-VC state in which it has stored the same 
    <i>NdisVcHandle</i>, as an input parameter.

Only connection-oriented miniport drivers that provide integrated call-management support can call 
    <b>NdisMCmCloseCallComplete</b>. Stand-alone call managers, which register themselves with NDIS as
    protocol drivers, call 
    <b>NdisCmCloseCallComplete</b> instead.
