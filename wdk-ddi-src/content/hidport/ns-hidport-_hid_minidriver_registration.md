# _HID_MINIDRIVER_REGISTRATION structure
The HID_MINIDRIVER_REGISTRATION structure contains registration information that a HID minidriver passes to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/E7C57273-B661-4B82-816E-E1466DAF67EA">HID Client Drivers</a> when the minidriver registers with the class driver.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _HID_MINIDRIVER_REGISTRATION {
  ULONG           Revision;
  PDRIVER_OBJECT  DriverObject;
  PUNICODE_STRING RegistryPath;
  ULONG           DeviceExtensionSize;
  BOOLEAN         DevicesArePolled;
  UCHAR           Reserved[3];
} HID_MINIDRIVER_REGISTRATION, *PHID_MINIDRIVER_REGISTRATION;
````

## Members


`DeviceExtensionSize`

Specifies the length, in bytes, that the minidriver requests for a device extension.

`DevicesArePolled`

Specifies that the devices on the bus that this minidriver supports must be polled in order to obtain data from the device.

`DriverObject`

Pointer to the minidriver's <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_driver_object.md">DRIVER_OBJECT</a>.

`RegistryPath`

Pointer to the minidriver's registry path.

`Reserved`

Reserved for internal system use.

`Revision`

Specifies the HID version that this minidriver supports.

## Remarks
When a HID minidriver calls <a href="..\hidport\nf-hidport-hidregisterminidriver.md">HidRegisterMinidriver</a>, it uses this structure to pass information to the HID class driver. The minidriver must must zero-initialize this structure before setting members. A minidriver sets the members <b>DriverObject</b> and <b>RegistryPath</b> to the driver object and registry path parameters that are passed to the minidriver as system-supplied parameters to its <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-driver_initialize.md">DriverEntry</a> routine. <b>Revision</b> should be set to HID_REVISION.
