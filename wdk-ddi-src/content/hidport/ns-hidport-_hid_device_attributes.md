# _HID_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTES structure
The HID_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTES structure contains information about a HIDClass device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _HID_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTES {
  ULONG  Size;
  USHORT VendorID;
  USHORT ProductID;
  USHORT VersionNumber;
  USHORT Reserved[11];
} HID_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTES, *PHID_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTES;
````

## Members


`ProductID`

Specifies a HID device's product ID.

`Reserved`

Reserved for internal system use.

`Size`

Specifies the size of the structure. This member should be treated as read-only when a HID minidriver uses this structure to complete an <a href="..\hidport\ni-hidport-ioctl_hid_get_device_attributes.md">IOCTL_HID_GET_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTES</a> request.

`VendorID`

Specifies a HID device's vendor ID.

`VersionNumber`

Specifies the manufacturer's revision number for a HID device.

## Remarks
The HID class driver uses this structure to obtain device attributes when it sends an <a href="..\hidport\ni-hidport-ioctl_hid_get_device_attributes.md">IOCTL_HID_GET_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTES</a> request to a HID minidriver.

## Requirements
