# IOCTL_HID_GET_REPORT_DESCRIPTOR IOCTL



## -description
<p>The IOCTL_HID_GET_REPORT_DESCRIPTOR request obtains the report descriptor for a HIDClass device.</p>
<p>For general information about HIDClass devices, see <a href="NULL">HID Collections</a>. </p>


## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
<p><b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.OutputBufferLength</b> specifies the length, in bytes, of the locked-down buffer at <b>Irp-&gt;UserBuffer</b>.</p>

### -input-buffer-length
<p>The size of <b>OutputBufferLength</b>.</p>

<p>The size of <b>OutputBufferLength</b>.</p>

### -output-buffer
<p>The HID minidriver fills the buffer at <b>Irp-&gt;UserBuffer</b> with the report descriptor.</p>

### -status-block
I/O Status block
<p>HID minidrivers that carry out the I/O to the device set the following fields of <b>Irp-&gt;IoStatus</b>:</p>

<p><b>Information</b> is set to the number of bytes transferred from the device.</p>

<p><b>Status</b> is set to STATUS_SUCCESS if the transfer completed without error. Otherwise, it is set to an appropriate NTSTATUS error code.</p>

<p>HID minidrivers that call other drivers with this IOCTL to carry out the I/O to their device, should ensure that the <b>Information</b> field of the status block is correct and not change the contents of the <b>Status</b> field.</p>
