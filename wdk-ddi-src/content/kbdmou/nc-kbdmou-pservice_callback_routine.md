# PSERVICE_CALLBACK_ROUTINE callback function
A function driver calls the class service callback in its ISR dispatch completion routine. The class service callback transfers input data from the input data buffer of a device to the class data queue.

## Syntax

```
PSERVICE_CALLBACK_ROUTINE PserviceCallbackRoutine;

void PserviceCallbackRoutine(
  PVOID NormalContext,
  PVOID SystemArgument1,
  PVOID SystemArgument2,
  PVOID SystemArgument3
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`NormalContext`

Pointer to the class device object.

`SystemArgument1`

Pointer to the first keyboard input data packet in the input data buffer of the port device.

`SystemArgument2`

Pointer to the keyboard input data packet that immediately follows the last data packet in the input data buffer of the port device.

`SystemArgument3`

Pointer to the number of keyboard input data packets that are transferred by the routine.


## Return Value

This callback function does not return a value.

## Remarks

<b>Keyboard Class Service Callback</b>

Here is the definition of the  keyboard class service callback routine.

Kbdclass uses an <a href="..\kbdmou\ni-kbdmou-ioctl_internal_keyboard_connect.md">IOCTL_INTERNAL_KEYBOARD_CONNECT</a> request to connect its class service callback to a keyboard device. In this call, the driver sets  its implementation in a <a href="..\kbdmou\ns-kbdmou-_connect_data.md">CONNECT_DATA</a> structure.

<pre class="syntax" xml:space="preserve"><code>
/*
DeviceObject [in] 
Pointer to the class device object.

InputDataStart [in] 
Pointer to the first keyboard input data packet in the input data buffer of the port device.

InputDataEnd [in] 
Pointer to the keyboard input data packet that immediately follows the last data packet in the input data buffer of the port device.

InputDataConsumed [in, out] 
Pointer to the number of keyboard input data packets that are transferred by the routine.

<b>KeyboardClassServiceCallback</b> transfers input data from the input buffer of the device to the class data queue. This routine is called by the ISR dispatch completion routine of the function driver.

<b>KeyboardClassServiceCallback</b> can be supplemented by a filter service callback that is provided by an upper-level keyboard filter driver. A filter service callback filters the keyboard data that is transferred to the class data queue. For example, the filter service callback can delete, transform, or insert data. <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=256125">Kbfiltr</a>, the sample filter driver in code gallery, includes <b>KbFilter_ServiceCallback</b>, which is a template for a keyboard filter service callback.

<b>Mouse Class Service Callback</b>

Here is the <b>MouseClassServiceCallback</b> routine is the class service callback routine that is provided by Mouclass. The driver uses an <a href="..\kbdmou\ni-kbdmou-ioctl_internal_mouse_connect.md">IOCTL_INTERNAL_MOUSE_CONNECT</a> request to connect its class service callback to a mouse device. In this call, the driver sets  its implementation in a <a href="..\kbdmou\ns-kbdmou-_connect_data.md">CONNECT_DATA</a> structure.


<pre class="syntax" xml:space="preserve"><code>
