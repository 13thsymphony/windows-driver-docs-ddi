# ReadPointer function
The <b>ReadPointer</b> function reads a pointer from the target.

## Syntax

````
__inline ULONG ReadPointer(
   ULONG64  Address,
   PULONG64 Pointer
);
````

## Parameters

`Address`

Specifies the address of the pointer to read.

`Pointer`

Receives the value of the pointer.  If the target uses 32-bit pointers, the pointer is sign-extended to 64 bits.


## Return Value

If the function succeeds, the return value is <b>TRUE</b>; otherwise, it is <b>FALSE</b>.

## Remarks

If you are writing a WdbgExts extension, include <b>wdbgexts.h</b>. If you are writing a DbgEng extension that calls this function, include <b>wdbgexts.h</b> before <b>dbgeng.h</b> (see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561480">Writing DbgEng Extension Code</a> for details).
