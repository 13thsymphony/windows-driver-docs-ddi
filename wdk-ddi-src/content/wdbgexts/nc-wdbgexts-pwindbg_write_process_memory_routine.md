# PWINDBG_WRITE_PROCESS_MEMORY_ROUTINE callback function
The <b>PWINDBG_WRITE_PROCESS_MEMORY_ROUTINE</b> (<b>WriteMemory</b>) function works like the Win32 <b>WriteProcessMemory</b> routine. It writes memory to the process being debugged. The entire area to be written must be accessible, or the operation fails.

## Syntax

```
PWINDBG_WRITE_PROCESS_MEMORY_ROUTINE PwindbgWriteProcessMemoryRoutine;

ULONG PwindbgWriteProcessMemoryRoutine(
  ULONG_PTR offset,
  LPCVOID lpBuffer,
  ULONG cb,
  PULONG lpcbBytesWritten
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`offset`

Specifies the base address of the memory to be written in the process that is being debugged.

`lpBuffer`



`cb`

Specifies the number of bytes that <b>WriteMemory</b> should write.

`lpcbBytesWritten`

Receives the actual number of bytes that <b>WriteMemory</b> transferred from the buffer. This parameter is optional; if it is <b>NULL</b>, it is ignored.


## Return Value

If the routine succeeds, the return value is <b>TRUE</b>; otherwise, it is <b>FALSE</b>.

## Remarks

For a WdbgExts extension, include wdbgexts.h. For a DbgEng extension, include wdbgexts.h before dbgeng.h. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561480">Writing DbgEng Extension Code</a> for details.
