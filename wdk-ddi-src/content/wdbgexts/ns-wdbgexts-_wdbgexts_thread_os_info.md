# _WDBGEXTS_THREAD_OS_INFO structure



## -description
The IG_GET_THREAD_OS_INFO <a href="debugger.ioctl">Ioctl</a> operation returns information about an operating system thread in the target.  When calling <b>Ioctl</b> with <i>IoctlType</i> set to IG_GET_THREAD_OS_INFO, <i>IpvData</i> should contain an instance of the WDBGEXTS_THREAD_OS_INFO structure.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _WDBGEXTS_THREAD_OS_INFO {
  ULONG   ThreadId;
  ULONG   ExitStatus;
  ULONG   PriorityClass;
  ULONG   Priority;
  ULONG64 CreateTime;
  ULONG64 ExitTime;
  ULONG64 KernelTime;
  ULONG64 UserTime;
  ULONG64 StartOffset;
  ULONG64 Affinity;
} WDBGEXTS_THREAD_OS_INFO, *PWDBGEXTS_THREAD_OS_INFO;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field ThreadId

Specifies the operating system thread ID (within the current process) for the thread whose information is being requested.


### -field ExitStatus

Receives the exit code of the thread.  If the thread is still running or the exit code is not known, <b>ExitStatus</b> will be set to STILL_ACTIVE.


### -field PriorityClass

Receives the priority class of the thread.  The priority classes are defined by the constants <i>XXX</i>_PRIORITY_CLASS in WinBase.h.  See the Platform SDK for more information about thread priority classes.  If the priority class is not know, <b>PriorityClass</b> will be set to zero.


### -field Priority

Receives the priority of the thread relative to the priority class.  Some thread priorities are defined by the constants THREAD_PRIORITY_<i>XXX</i> in WinBase.h.  See the Platform SDK for more information about thread priorities.  If the priority is not known, <b>Priority</b> will be set to THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL.


### -field CreateTime

Receives the creation time of the thread.


### -field ExitTime

Receives the exit time of the thread.  If the thread has not exited, <b>ExitTime</b> is undefined.


### -field KernelTime

Receives the amount of time that the thread has executed in kernel mode.


### -field UserTime

Receives the amount of time that the thread has executed in user-mode.


### -field StartOffset

Receives the starting address of the thread.  If the starting address is not known, <b>StartOffset</b> will be set to zero.


### -field Affinity

Receives the thread affinity mask for the thread in a symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) computer.  See the Platform SDK for more information about the thread affinity mask.  If the affinity mask is not known, <b>Affinity</b> is set to zero.


## -remarks
The parameters for the IG_GET_THREAD_OS_INFO <a href="debugger.ioctl">Ioctl</a> operation are the members of the WDBGEXTS_THREAD_OS_INFO structure.
