# GetShortField function



## -description
The <b>GetShortField</b> function reads the value of a member in a structure if its size is less than or equal to 8 bytes, or initializes a structure so it can be read later.  This function is not intended to be used directly; <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550953">InitTypeRead</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550957">InitTypeReadPhysical</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553539">ReadField</a> should be used instead.


## -syntax

````
__inline ULONG64 GetShortField(
  _In_ ULONG64 TypeAddress,
  _In_ LPCSTR  Name,
  _In_ USHORT  StoreAddress
);
````


## -parameters

### -param TypeAddress [in]

The meaning of this parameter depends on the value of <i>StoreAddress</i>.


### -param If StoreAddress is non-zero:

Specifies the address of the structure in the target's memory.  This address is used for subsequent calls when <i>StoreAddress</i> is zero. 

### -param If StoreAddress is zero:

<i>TypeAddress</i> is ignored.  The value of <i>TypeAddress</i> from the last call when <i>StoreAddress</i> was non-zero is used to specify the address of the structure in the target's memory. 
</dd>
</dl>

### -param Name [in]

The meaning of this parameter depends on the value of <i>StoreAddress</i>.


### -param If StoreAddress is non-zero:

Specifies the name of the type of the structure at <i>TypeAddress</i>.

### -param If StoreAddress is zero:

Specifies the name of the member in the structure to read.  The address and type of the structure are remembered from a previous call to this function with <i>StoreAddress</i> not equal to zero.  Submembers can be specified by using a period-separated path, for example, "myfield.mysubfield". 
</dd>
</dl>

### -param StoreAddress [in]

Specifies the mode of this function.


### -param If StoreAddress is non-zero:

Causes this function to initialize a structure for reading its members.  The address and type name for the structure is remembered.
If the bit value 0x2 is set in <i>StoreAddress</i>, the address <i>TypeAddress</i> is considered a physical address; otherwise, it is considered a virtual address. 

### -param If StoreAddress is zero:

Causes this function to read a member from a previously initialized structure. 
</dd>
</dl>

## -returns
<dl>
<dt><b>If <i>StoreAddress</i> is non-zero:</b></dt>
</dl>If the function succeeds, it returns the value zero.  If the function fails because the caller passed a zero value as <i>TypeAddress</i>, it returns the value MEMORY_READ_ERROR (defined in Wdbgexts.h).  If the function fails for any other reason, it returns an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/41d64bbc-cefe-4665-b054-e6bd135ccd20">IG_DUMP_SYMBOL_INFO error code</a>.
<dl>
<dt><b>If <i>StoreAddress</i> is zero:</b></dt>
</dl>If the function succeeds, it returns the value of the specified field in the previously initialized structure.  The structure is the one initialized in a previous call to <b>GetShortField</b>.  The field is the one specified by the <i>Name</i> parameter of the current call to <b>GetShortField</b>. The return value is cast to ULONG64.  If the function fails, it returns the value zero. 

 

## -remarks
When <b>GetShortField</b> is called with a nonzero <i>StoreAddress</i> value, it initializes the structure located at the address specified by <i>TypeAddress</i>. Only one structure can be initialized at a time. If <b>GetShortField</b> is called more than once with a nonzero <i>StoreAddress</i> value, only the structure specified in the most recent call is initialized. When <b>GetShortField</b> is called with <i>StoreAddress</i> equal to zero, it accesses the most recently initialized structure, reads in that structure the field specified by <i>Name</i>, and returns the value of that field. 

This function does not need to be called directly.  The macros <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550953">InitTypeRead</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550957">InitTypeReadPhysical</a> call this function with <i>StoreAddress</i> non-zero to prepare a structure for reading its members.  The macro <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553539">ReadField</a> calls this function with <i>StoreAddress</i> (and <i>TypeAddress</i>) equal to zero, to read members from the structure.

The <b>ReadField</b> and <b>ReadFieldStr</b> macros read a field whose size is less than 8 bytes from a structure initialized with <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550953">InitTypeRead</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550957">InitTypeReadPhysical</a>.
