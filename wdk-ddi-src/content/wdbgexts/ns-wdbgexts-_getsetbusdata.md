# _GETSETBUSDATA structure
The IG_GET_BUS_DATA <a href="..\wdbgexts\nc-wdbgexts-pwindbg_ioctl_routine.md">Ioctl</a> operation reads data from a system bus and the IG_SET_BUS_DATA <b>Ioctl</b> operation writes data to a system bus.  When calling <b>Ioctl</b> with <i>IoctlType</i> set to IG_GET_BUS_DATA or IG_SET_BUS_DATA, <i>IpvData</i> should contain an instance of the BUSDATA structure.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _GETSETBUSDATA {
  ULONG BusDataType;
  ULONG BusNumber;
  ULONG SlotNumber;
  PVOID Buffer;
  ULONG Offset;
  ULONG Length;
} BUSDATA, *PBUSDATA;
````

## Members


`Buffer`

Specifies the buffer that contains the memory to write to the bus, or to receive the memory that is read from the bus.

The size of <b>Buffer</b> must be at least the value of <b>Length</b>.

`BusDataType`

Specifies the bus data type to use.  For details of allowed values, see the documentation for the BUS_DATA_TYPE enumeration in the Platform SDK.

`BusNumber`

Specifies the system-assigned number of the bus.  This is usually zero, unless the system has more than one bus of the same bus data type.

`Length`

Specifies the number of bytes to read from or write to the bus when the <b>Ioctl</b> operation is called.  Upon returning, <b>Length</b> is set to the number of bytes actually read or written.

`Offset`

Specifies the offset in the bus data to start reading from or writing to.

`SlotNumber`

Specifies the logical slot number on the bus.

## Remarks
The parameters for the IG_GET_BUS_DATA and IG_SET_BUS_DATA <a href="..\wdbgexts\nc-wdbgexts-pwindbg_ioctl_routine.md">Ioctl</a> operations are the members of the BUSDATA structure.

This operation is only available in kernel-mode debugging.

The properties of the data in the bus depends on the system, bus, and slot.
