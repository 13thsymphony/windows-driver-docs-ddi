# GetPebAddress function
The <b>GetPebAddress</b> function returns the address of the process environment block (PEB) for a system process.

## Syntax

```
void GetPebAddress(
  ULONG64    CurrentThread,
  PULONGLONG Address
);
```

## Parameters

`CurrentThread`

Specifies an operating system thread whose PEB's address will be returned.

In kernel-mode debugging, this is the location of the KTHREAD structure, which is returned by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545889">GetCurrentThreadAddr</a>.  If <i>CurrentThread</i> is <b>NULL</b>, the PEB for the current process is returned.

In user-mode debugging, <i>CurrentThread</i> is ignored.

`Address`

Receives the address of the PEB for the current operating system process or, in kernel-mode debugging, when <i>CurrentThread</i> is not <b>NULL</b>, for the system process that contains the thread that is specified by <i>CurrentThread</i>.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

In user-mode debugging, the PEB for the current thread is returned.

In kernel-mode debugging, if <i>CurrentThread</i> is <b>NULL</b>, the PEB for the operating system process in which the last event occurred is returned.
