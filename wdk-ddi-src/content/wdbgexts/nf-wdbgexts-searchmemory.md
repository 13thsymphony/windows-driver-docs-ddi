## -syntax

````
__inline VOID SearchMemory(
   ULONG64  SearchAddress,

   PVOID    Pattern,
   PULONG64 FoundAddress
);
````


## -parameters

### -param SearchAddress 

Specifies the address in the target's virtual memory from which to start the search.


### -param SearchLength 

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the memory to search.  For a successful match, the pattern must be found before <i>SearchLength</i> bytes have been examined.


### -param PatternLength 

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the pattern to search for.


### -param Pattern 

Specifies the pattern to search for.


### -param FoundAddress
