# WmiFireEvent function
The <b>WmiFireEvent</b> routine sends an event to WMI for delivery to data consumers that have requested notification of the event.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS WmiFireEvent(
  _In_     PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject,
  _In_     LPCGUID        Guid,
  _In_     ULONG          InstanceIndex,
  _In_     ULONG          EventDataSize,
  _In_opt_ PVOID          EventData
);
````

## Parameters

`DeviceObject`

A pointer to the driver's <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_device_object.md">DEVICE_OBJECT</a>.

`Guid`

A pointer to the GUID that represents the event block.

`InstanceIndex`

If the event block has multiple instances, specifies the index of the instance.

`EventDataSize`

Specifies the number of bytes of data at <i>EventData</i>. If no data is generated for an event, <i>EventData</i> must be zero.

`EventData`

A pointer to a driver-allocated nonpaged buffer containing data generated by the driver for the event. If no data is generated for an event, <i>EventData</i> must be <b>NULL</b>. WMI frees the buffer without further intervention by the driver.


## Return Value

<b>WmiFireEvent</b> propagates the status returned by <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iowmiwriteevent.md">IoWmiWriteEvent</a>, or returns STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES if it could not allocate memory for the event.

## Remarks

A driver calls <b>WmiFireEvent</b> to send an event to WMI for delivery to all data consumers that have requested notification of the event. All pointers passed to <b>WmiFireEvent</b> must point to nonpagable memory, such as nonpaged pool.

The driver sends an event only if it has been previously enabled by the driver's <a href="..\wmilib\nc-wmilib-wmi_function_control_callback.md">DpWmiFunctionControl</a> routine, which WMI calls to process an <b>IRP_MN_ENABLE_EVENT</b> request.

The driver writes any data associated with the event to the buffer at <i>EventData</i>. WMI fills in a <a href="..\wmistr\ns-wmistr-tagwnode_single_instance.md">WNODE_SINGLE_INSTANCE</a> structure with the data and calls <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iowmiwriteevent.md">IoWmiWriteEvent</a> to deliver the event.
