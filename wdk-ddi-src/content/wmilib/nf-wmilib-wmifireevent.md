# WmiFireEvent function



## -description
<p>The <b>WmiFireEvent</b> routine sends an event to WMI for delivery to data consumers that have requested notification of the event.</p>


## -syntax

````
NTSTATUS WmiFireEvent(
  _In_     PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject,
  _In_     LPCGUID        Guid,
  _In_     ULONG          InstanceIndex,
  _In_     ULONG          EventDataSize,
  _In_opt_ PVOID          EventData
);
````


## -parameters
<dl>

### -param <i>DeviceObject</i> [in]

<dd>
<p>A pointer to the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543147">DEVICE_OBJECT</a>. </p>
</dd>

### -param <i>Guid</i> [in]

<dd>
<p>A pointer to the GUID that represents the event block. </p>
</dd>

### -param <i>InstanceIndex</i> [in]

<dd>
<p>If the event block has multiple instances, specifies the index of the instance. </p>
</dd>

### -param <i>EventDataSize</i> [in]

<dd>
<p>Specifies the number of bytes of data at <i>EventData</i>. If no data is generated for an event, <i>EventData</i> must be zero. </p>
</dd>

### -param <i>EventData</i> [in, optional]

<dd>
<p>A pointer to a driver-allocated nonpaged buffer containing data generated by the driver for the event. If no data is generated for an event, <i>EventData</i> must be <b>NULL</b>. WMI frees the buffer without further intervention by the driver. </p>
</dd>
</dl>

## -returns
<p><b>WmiFireEvent</b> propagates the status returned by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550520">IoWmiWriteEvent</a>, or returns STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES if it could not allocate memory for the event.</p>

## -remarks
<p>A driver calls <b>WmiFireEvent</b> to send an event to WMI for delivery to all data consumers that have requested notification of the event. All pointers passed to <b>WmiFireEvent</b> must point to nonpagable memory, such as nonpaged pool.</p>

<p>The driver sends an event only if it has been previously enabled by the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544094">DpWmiFunctionControl</a> routine, which WMI calls to process an <b>IRP_MN_ENABLE_EVENT</b> request.</p>

<p>The driver writes any data associated with the event to the buffer at <i>EventData</i>. WMI fills in a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566377">WNODE_SINGLE_INSTANCE</a> structure with the data and calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550520">IoWmiWriteEvent</a> to deliver the event.</p>
