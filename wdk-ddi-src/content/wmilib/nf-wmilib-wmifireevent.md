# WmiFireEvent function



## -description
The <b>WmiFireEvent</b> routine sends an event to WMI for delivery to data consumers that have requested notification of the event.


## -syntax

````
NTSTATUS WmiFireEvent(
  _In_     PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject,
  _In_     LPCGUID        Guid,
  _In_     ULONG          InstanceIndex,
  _In_     ULONG          EventDataSize,
  _In_opt_ PVOID          EventData
);
````


## -parameters

### -param DeviceObject [in]

A pointer to the driver's <a href="kernel.device_object">DEVICE_OBJECT</a>. 

### -param Guid [in]

A pointer to the GUID that represents the event block. 

### -param InstanceIndex [in]

If the event block has multiple instances, specifies the index of the instance. 

### -param EventDataSize [in]

Specifies the number of bytes of data at <i>EventData</i>. If no data is generated for an event, <i>EventData</i> must be zero. 

### -param EventData [in, optional]

A pointer to a driver-allocated nonpaged buffer containing data generated by the driver for the event. If no data is generated for an event, <i>EventData</i> must be <b>NULL</b>. WMI frees the buffer without further intervention by the driver. 

## -returns
<b>WmiFireEvent</b> propagates the status returned by <a href="kernel.iowmiwriteevent">IoWmiWriteEvent</a>, or returns STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES if it could not allocate memory for the event.

## -remarks
A driver calls <b>WmiFireEvent</b> to send an event to WMI for delivery to all data consumers that have requested notification of the event. All pointers passed to <b>WmiFireEvent</b> must point to nonpagable memory, such as nonpaged pool.

The driver sends an event only if it has been previously enabled by the driver's <a href="kernel.dpwmifunctioncontrol">DpWmiFunctionControl</a> routine, which WMI calls to process an <b>IRP_MN_ENABLE_EVENT</b> request.

The driver writes any data associated with the event to the buffer at <i>EventData</i>. WMI fills in a <a href="kernel.wnode_single_instance">WNODE_SINGLE_INSTANCE</a> structure with the data and calls <a href="kernel.iowmiwriteevent">IoWmiWriteEvent</a> to deliver the event.
