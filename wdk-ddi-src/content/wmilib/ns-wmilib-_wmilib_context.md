# _WMILIB_CONTEXT structure
The <b>WMILIB_CONTEXT</b> structure provides registration information for a driver's data blocks and event blocks and defines entry points for the driver's WMI library callback routines.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _WMILIB_CONTEXT {
  ULONG                 GuidCount;
  PWMIGUIDREGINFO       GuidList;
  PWMI_QUERY_REGINFO    QueryWmiRegInfo;
  PWMI_QUERY_DATABLOCK  QueryWmiDataBlock;
  PWMI_SET_DATABLOCK    SetWmiDataBlock;
  PWMI_SET_DATAITEM     SetWmiDataItem;
  PWMI_EXECUTE_METHOD   ExecuteWmiMethod;
  PWMI_FUNCTION_CONTROL WmiFunctionControl;
} WMILIB_CONTEXT, *PWMILIB_CONTEXT;
````

## Members


`ExecuteWmiMethod`

Pointer to the driver's <a href="..\wmilib\nc-wmilib-wmi_execute_method_callback.md">DpWmiExecuteMethod</a> routine, which is an optional entry point for drivers that call WMI library support routines. If the driver does not implement this routine, it must set this member to <b>NULL</b>. In this case, WMI returns STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_REQUEST to the caller in response to any <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550868">IRP_MN_EXECUTE_METHOD</a> request.

`GuidCount`

Specifies the number of blocks registered by the driver.

`GuidList`

Pointer to an array of <b>GuidCount</b> <a href="..\wmilib\ns-wmilib-_wmiguidreginfo.md">WMIGUIDREGINFO</a> structures that contain registration information for each block.

`QueryWmiDataBlock`

Pointer to the driver's <a href="..\wmilib\nc-wmilib-wmi_query_datablock_callback.md">DpWmiQueryDataBlock</a> routine, which is a required entry point for drivers that call WMI library support routines.

`QueryWmiRegInfo`

Pointer to the driver's <a href="..\wmilib\nc-wmilib-wmi_query_reginfo_callback.md">DpWmiQueryReginfo</a> routine, which is a required entry point for drivers that call WMI library support routines.

`SetWmiDataBlock`

Pointer to the driver's <a href="..\wmilib\nc-wmilib-wmi_set_datablock_callback.md">DpWmiSetDataBlock</a> routine, which is an optional entry point for drivers that call WMI library support routines. If the driver does not implement this routine, it must set this member to <b>NULL</b>. In this case, WMI returns STATUS_WMI_READ_ONLY to the caller in response to any <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550831">IRP_MN_CHANGE_SINGLE_INSTANCE</a> request.

`SetWmiDataItem`

Pointer to the driver's <a href="..\wmilib\nc-wmilib-wmi_set_dataitem_callback.md">DpWmiSetDataItem</a> routine, which is an optional entry point for drivers that call WMI library support routines. If the driver does not implement this routine, it must set this member to <b>NULL</b>. In this case, WMI returns STATUS_WMI_READ_ONLY to the caller in response to any <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550836">IRP_MN_CHANGE_SINGLE_ITEM</a> request.

`WmiFunctionControl`

Pointer to the driver's <a href="..\wmilib\nc-wmilib-wmi_function_control_callback.md">DpWmiFunctionControl</a> routine, which is an optional entry point for drivers that call WMI library support routines. If the driver does not implement this routine, it must set this member to <b>NULL</b>. In this case, WMI returns STATUS_SUCCESS to the caller in response to any <b>IRP_MN_ENABLE_<i>XXX</i></b> or <b>IRP_MN_DISABLE_<i>XXX</i></b> request.

## Remarks
A driver that handles WMI IRPs by calling WMI library support routines stores an initialized <b>WMILIB_CONTEXT</b> structure (or a pointer to such a structure) in its device extension. A driver can use the same <b>WMILIB_CONTEXT</b> structure for multiple device objects if each device object supplies the same set of data blocks. 

When the driver receives an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550813">IRP_MJ_SYSTEM_CONTROL</a> request, it calls <a href="..\wmilib\nf-wmilib-wmisystemcontrol.md">WmiSystemControl</a> with a pointer to its <b>WMILIB_CONTEXT</b> structure, a pointer to its device object, and a pointer to the IRP. <b>WmiSystemControl</b> determines whether the IRP contains a WMI request and, if so, handles the request by calling the driver's appropriate <i>DpWmiXxx</i> routine.

Memory for this structure can be allocated from paged pool.
