# WMI_SET_DATABLOCK_CALLBACK callback function
The <i>DpWmiSetDataBlock</i> routine changes all data items in a single instance of a data block. This routine is optional.

## Syntax

```
WMI_SET_DATABLOCK_CALLBACK WmiSetDatablockCallback;

NTSTATUS WmiSetDatablockCallback(
  PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject,
  PIRP Irp,
  ULONG GuidIndex,
  ULONG InstanceIndex,
  ULONG BufferSize,
  PUCHAR Buffer
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`DeviceObject`

Pointer to the driver's WDM <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_device_object.md">DEVICE_OBJECT</a> structure.

`Irp`

Pointer to the IRP.

`GuidIndex`

Specifies the data block by its zero-based index into the list of GUIDs provided by the driver in the <a href="..\wmilib\ns-wmilib-_wmilib_context.md">WMILIB_CONTEXT</a> structure it passed to <a href="..\wmilib\nf-wmilib-wmisystemcontrol.md">WmiSystemControl</a>.

`InstanceIndex`

If the block specified by <i>GuidIndex </i>has multiple instances, <i>InstanceIndex</i> specifies the instance.

`BufferSize`

Specifies the size in bytes of the buffer at <i>Buffer</i>.

`Buffer`

Pointer to a buffer that contains new values for the instance.


## Return Value

<i>DpWmiSetDataBlock</i> returns STATUS_SUCCESS or an appropriate error status such as the following:

If the driver cannot complete the request immediately, it can return STATUS_PENDING.

## Remarks

WMI calls a driver's <i>DpWmiSetDataBlock</i> routine after the driver calls <a href="..\wmilib\nf-wmilib-wmisystemcontrol.md">WmiSystemControl</a> in response to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550831">IRP_MN_CHANGE_SINGLE_INSTANCE</a> request.

The driver is responsible for validating all input arguments. Specifically, the driver must do the following:

<ul>
<li>
Verify that the <i>GuidIndex</i> value is between zero and GuidCount-1, based on the <b>GuidCount</b> member of the <a href="..\wmilib\ns-wmilib-_wmilib_context.md">WMILIB_CONTEXT</a> structure.

</li>
<li>
Verify that the driver has not flagged the specified data block for removal. If the driver recently specified the WMIREG_FLAG_REMOVE_GUID flag in a <a href="..\wmilib\ns-wmilib-_wmiguidreginfo.md">WMIGUIDREGINFO</a> structure that is contained in a <b>WMILIB_CONTEXT</b> structure, it is possible for a set request to arrive before the removal occurs.

</li>
<li>
Verify that the <i>InstanceIndex</i> value is within the range of instance indexes that are supported by the driver for the data block.

</li>
<li>
Verify that <i>Buffer</i> and <i>BufferSize</i> describe a valid-sized data block, including any padding that exists between data items, and that the contents of the buffer are valid for the data block.

</li>
<li>
Verify that the specified data block is one for which the driver allows caller-initiated modifications. In other words, the driver should not allow modifications to data blocks that you intended to be read-only.

</li>
</ul>
Do not assume the thread context is that of the initiating user-mode application—a higher-level driver might have changed it.

If a driver implements a <i>DpWmiSetDataBlock</i> routine, the driver must place the routine's address in the <b>SetWmiDataBlock</b> member of the <a href="..\wmilib\ns-wmilib-_wmilib_context.md">WMILIB_CONTEXT</a> structure that it passes to <a href="..\wmilib\nf-wmilib-wmisystemcontrol.md">WmiSystemControl</a>. If a driver does not implement a <i>DpWmiSetDataBlock</i> routine, it must set <b>SetWmiDataBlock</b> to <b>NULL</b>. In the latter case, WMI returns STATUS_READ_ONLY to the caller.

This routine can be pageable.
