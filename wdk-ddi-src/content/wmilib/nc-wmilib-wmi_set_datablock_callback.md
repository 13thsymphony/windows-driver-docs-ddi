# WMI_SET_DATABLOCK_CALLBACK callback



## -description
The <i>DpWmiSetDataBlock</i> routine changes all data items in a single instance of a data block. This routine is optional.



## -prototype

````
WMI_SET_DATABLOCK_CALLBACK DpWmiSetDataBlock;

NTSTATUS DpWmiSetDataBlock(
  _In_ PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject,
  _In_ PIRP           Irp,
  _In_ ULONG          GuidIndex,
  _In_ ULONG          InstanceIndex,
  _In_ ULONG          BufferSize,
  _In_ PUCHAR         Buffer
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param DeviceObject [in]

Pointer to the driver's WDM <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543147">DEVICE_OBJECT</a> structure.


### -param Irp [in]

Pointer to the IRP.


### -param GuidIndex [in]

Specifies the data block by its zero-based index into the list of GUIDs provided by the driver in the <a href="..\wmilib\ns-wmilib-_wmilib_context.md">WMILIB_CONTEXT</a> structure it passed to <a href="..\wmilib\nf-wmilib-wmisystemcontrol.md">WmiSystemControl</a>.


### -param InstanceIndex [in]

If the block specified by <i>GuidIndex </i>has multiple instances, <i>InstanceIndex</i> specifies the instance.


### -param BufferSize [in]

Specifies the size in bytes of the buffer at <i>Buffer</i>.


### -param Buffer [in]

Pointer to a buffer that contains new values for the instance.


## -returns
<i>DpWmiSetDataBlock</i> returns STATUS_SUCCESS or an appropriate error status such as the following:
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_WMI_INSTANCE_NOT_FOUND</b></dt>
<dt><b>STATUS_WMI_GUID_NOT_FOUND</b></dt>
<dt><b>STATUS_WMI_READ_ONLY</b></dt>
<dt><b>STATUS_WMI_SET_FAILURE</b></dt>
</dl>If the driver cannot complete the request immediately, it can return STATUS_PENDING.


## -remarks
WMI calls a driver's <i>DpWmiSetDataBlock</i> routine after the driver calls <a href="..\wmilib\nf-wmilib-wmisystemcontrol.md">WmiSystemControl</a> in response to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550831">IRP_MN_CHANGE_SINGLE_INSTANCE</a> request.

The driver is responsible for validating all input arguments. Specifically, the driver must do the following:

Verify that the <i>GuidIndex</i> value is between zero and GuidCount-1, based on the <b>GuidCount</b> member of the <a href="..\wmilib\ns-wmilib-_wmilib_context.md">WMILIB_CONTEXT</a> structure.

Verify that the driver has not flagged the specified data block for removal. If the driver recently specified the WMIREG_FLAG_REMOVE_GUID flag in a <a href="..\wmilib\ns-wmilib-_wmiguidreginfo.md">WMIGUIDREGINFO</a> structure that is contained in a <b>WMILIB_CONTEXT</b> structure, it is possible for a set request to arrive before the removal occurs.

Verify that the <i>InstanceIndex</i> value is within the range of instance indexes that are supported by the driver for the data block.

Verify that <i>Buffer</i> and <i>BufferSize</i> describe a valid-sized data block, including any padding that exists between data items, and that the contents of the buffer are valid for the data block.

Verify that the specified data block is one for which the driver allows caller-initiated modifications. In other words, the driver should not allow modifications to data blocks that you intended to be read-only.

Do not assume the thread context is that of the initiating user-mode application—a higher-level driver might have changed it.

If a driver implements a <i>DpWmiSetDataBlock</i> routine, the driver must place the routine's address in the <b>SetWmiDataBlock</b> member of the <a href="..\wmilib\ns-wmilib-_wmilib_context.md">WMILIB_CONTEXT</a> structure that it passes to <a href="..\wmilib\nf-wmilib-wmisystemcontrol.md">WmiSystemControl</a>. If a driver does not implement a <i>DpWmiSetDataBlock</i> routine, it must set <b>SetWmiDataBlock</b> to <b>NULL</b>. In the latter case, WMI returns STATUS_READ_ONLY to the caller.

This routine can be pageable.
