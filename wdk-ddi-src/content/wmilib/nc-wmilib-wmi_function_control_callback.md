# WMI_FUNCTION_CONTROL_CALLBACK callback function
The <i>DpWmiFunctionControl</i> routine enables or disables notification of events, and enables or disables data collection for data blocks that the driver registered as expensive to collect. This routine is optional.

## Syntax

```
WMI_FUNCTION_CONTROL_CALLBACK WmiFunctionControlCallback;

NTSTATUS WmiFunctionControlCallback(
  PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject,
  PIRP Irp,
  ULONG GuidIndex,
  WMIENABLEDISABLECONTROL Function,
  BOOLEAN Enable
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`DeviceObject`

Pointer to the driver's WDM <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_device_object.md">DEVICE_OBJECT</a> structure.

`Irp`

Pointer to the IRP.

`GuidIndex`

Specifies the data block by supplying a zero-based index into the list of GUIDs that the driver provided in the <a href="..\wmilib\ns-wmilib-_wmilib_context.md">WMILIB_CONTEXT</a> structure it passed to <a href="..\wmilib\nf-wmilib-wmisystemcontrol.md">WmiSystemControl</a>.

`Function`

Specifies what to enable or disable. <b>WmiEventControl</b> indicates an event, and <b>WmiDataBlockControl</b> indicates data collection for a block that was registered as expensive to collect (that is, a block for which the driver set WMIREG_FLAG_EXPENSIVE in <b>Flags</b> of the <a href="..\wmilib\ns-wmilib-_wmiguidreginfo.md">WMIGUIDREGINFO</a> structure used to register the block).

`Enable`

Specifies <b>TRUE</b> to enable the event or data collection, or <b>FALSE</b> to disable it.


## Return Value

<i>DpWmiFunctionControl</i> returns STATUS_SUCCESS or an appropriate error status such as:

## Remarks

WMI calls a driver's <i>DpWmiFunctionControl</i> routine after the driver calls <a href="..\wmilib\nf-wmilib-wmisystemcontrol.md">WmiSystemControl</a> in response to one of the following requests:


<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550857">IRP_MN_ENABLE_COLLECTION</a>



<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550848">IRP_MN_DISABLE_COLLECTION</a>



<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550859">IRP_MN_ENABLE_EVENTS</a>



<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550851">IRP_MN_DISABLE_EVENTS</a>


If a driver implements a <i>DpWmiFunctionControl</i> routine, the driver must place the routine's address in the <b>WmiFunctionControl</b> member of the <a href="..\wmilib\ns-wmilib-_wmilib_context.md">WMILIB_CONTEXT</a> structure that it passes to <a href="..\wmilib\nf-wmilib-wmisystemcontrol.md">WmiSystemControl</a>. If a driver does not implement a <i>DpWmiFunctionControl</i> routine, it must set <b>WmiFunctionControl</b> to <b>NULL</b>. In the latter case, WMI returns STATUS_SUCCESS to the caller.

The driver is responsible for validating all input arguments. Specifically, the driver must do the following:

<ul>
<li>
Verify that the <i>GuidIndex</i> value is between zero and GuidCount-1, based on the <b>GuidCount</b> member of the <a href="..\wmilib\ns-wmilib-_wmilib_context.md">WMILIB_CONTEXT</a> structure.

</li>
<li>
Verify that the driver has not flagged the specified data block for removal. If the driver recently specified the WMIREG_FLAG_REMOVE_GUID flag in a <a href="..\wmilib\ns-wmilib-_wmiguidreginfo.md">WMIGUIDREGINFO</a> structure that is contained in a <b>WMILIB_CONTEXT</b> structure, it is possible for an additional request to arrive before the removal occurs.

</li>
</ul>
It is unnecessary for the driver to check whether events or data collection are already enabled for a block, because WMI sends a single enable request when the first data consumer enables the block, and it sends a single disable request when the last data consumer disables the block. WMI will not call <i>DpWmiFunctionControl</i> to enable a block without an intervening call to disable it.

After enabling or disabling the event or data collection for the block, the driver calls <a href="..\wmilib\nf-wmilib-wmicompleterequest.md">WmiCompleteRequest</a> to complete the request.

This routine can be pageable.
