# WmiCompleteRequest function
The <b>WmiCompleteRequest</b> routine indicates that a driver has finished processing a WMI request in a <i>DpWmiXxx</i> routine.

## Syntax

```
NTSTATUS WmiCompleteRequest(
  PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject,
  PIRP           Irp,
  NTSTATUS       Status,
  ULONG          BufferUsed,
  CCHAR          PriorityBoost
);
```

## Parameters

`DeviceObject`

A pointer to the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543147">DEVICE_OBJECT</a>.

`Irp`

A pointer to the IRP.

`Status`

Specifies the status to return for the IRP.

`BufferUsed`

Specifies the number of bytes needed in the buffer passed to the driver's <i>DpWmiXxx</i> routine. If the buffer is too small, the driver sets <i>Status</i> to STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL and sets <i>BufferUsed</i> to the number of bytes needed for the data to be returned. If the buffer passed is large enough, the driver sets <i>BufferUsed</i> to the number of bytes actually used.

`PriorityBoost`

Specifies a system-defined constant by which to increment the run-time priority of the original thread that requested the operation. WMI calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548343">IoCompleteRequest</a> with <i>PriorityBoost</i> when it completes the IRP. See <b>IoCompleteRequest</b> for more information on <i>PriorityBoost</i>.


## Return Value

<b>WmiCompleteRequest</b> returns the value that was passed to it in the <i>Status</i> parameter unless <i>Status</i> was set to STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL.  If the driver set <i>Status</i> equal to STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL, <b>WmiCompleteRequest</b> builds a WNODE_TOO_SMALL structure and returns STATUS_SUCCESS. The return value from <b>WmiCompleteRequest</b> should be returned by the driver in its <i>DpWmiXxx</i> routine.

## Remarks

A driver calls <b>WmiCompleteRequest</b> from a <i>DpWmiXxx</i> routine after it finishes all other processing in that routine, or after the driver finishes all processing for a pending IRP. <b>WmiCompleteRequest</b> fills in a <b>WNODE_<i>XXX</i></b> with any data returned by the driver and calls <b>IoCompleteRequest</b> to complete the IRP.

A driver should always return the return value from <b>WmiCompleteRequest</b> in its <i>DpWmiXxx</i> routine.

A driver must not call <b>WmiCompleteRequest</b> from its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544097">DpWmiQueryRegInfo</a> routine.
