# KSRTAUDIO_SETWRITEPACKET_INFO structure
The KSRTAUDIO_SETWRITEPACKET_INFO structure describes information associated with an audio packet.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _KSRTAUDIO_SETWRITEPACKET_INFO {
  ULONG PacketNumber;
  DWORD Flags ;
  ULONG EosPacketLength;
} KSRTAUDIO_SETWRITEPACKET_INFO, *PKSRTAUDIO_SETWRITEPACKET_INFO;
````

## Members


`EosPacketLength`

The length of the EOS packet if <i>KSSTREAM_HEADER_OPTIONSF_ENDOFSTREAM</i> is specified in Flags. Zero is a valid value. If <i>KSSTREAM_HEADER_OPTIONSF_ENDOFSTREAM</i> is not specified in Flags, this parameter is ignored. The EosPacketLength is measured in bytes.

`Flags`

Additional attributes related to the packet or stream. 



<i>KSSTREAM_HEADER_OPTIONSF_ENDOFSTREAM</i> - This flag indicates that this packet represents the end of the data stream.

`PacketNumber`

The number of the packet written by the OS to the WaveRT buffer. Depending on the values returned by the driver in the KSPROPERTY_RTAUDIO_GETPACKETCOUNT property, the PacketNumber may skip values.
