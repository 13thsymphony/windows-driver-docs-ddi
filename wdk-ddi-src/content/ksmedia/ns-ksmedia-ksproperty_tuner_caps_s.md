# KSPROPERTY_TUNER_CAPS_S structure
The KSPROPERTY_TUNER_CAPS_S structure describes the hardware capabilities of TV and radio tuning devices.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct {
  KSPROPERTY   Property;
  ULONG        ModesSupported;
  KSPIN_MEDIUM VideoMedium;
  KSPIN_MEDIUM TVAudioMedium;
  KSPIN_MEDIUM RadioAudioMedium;
} KSPROPERTY_TUNER_CAPS_S, *PKSPROPERTY_TUNER_CAPS_S;
````

## Members

        
            `ModesSupported`

            Specifies a bitwise OR of the supported tuner modes. This member may be set to one or more of the following values from the KSPROPERTY_TUNER_MODES enumeration that is defined in <i>ksmedia.h</i>:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
KSPROPERTY_TUNER_MODE_TV

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the tuner is capable of tuning analog broadcast or cable television channels.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
KSPROPERTY_TUNER_MODE_FM_RADIO

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the tuner is capable of tuning FM radio channels.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
KSPROPERTY_TUNER_MODE_AM_RADIO

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the tuner is capable of tuning AM radio channels.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
KSPROPERTY_TUNER_MODE_DSS

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the tuner is capable of tuning DSS channels.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
KSPROPERTY_TUNER_MODE_ATSC

</td>
<td>
Indicates that the tuner is capable of tuning digital television channels. This setting can be used for ATSC, DVB-C, or DVB-T television reception.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
        
            `Property`

            Specifies an initialized <a href="..\ks\nf-ks-ikscontrol-ksproperty.md">KSPROPERTY</a> structure that describes the property set, property ID, and request type.
        
            `RadioAudioMedium`

            Specifies a unique GUID representing the hardware connection of the analog radio audio signal. This value enforces connections between filters. Possible values are <b>NULL</b>, indicating that no pin is created; GUID_NULL, indicating that Medium is not used to enforce connections; or a GUID. If a GUID value is used, only crossbar pins with a matching Medium GUID are allowed to connect.
        
            `TVAudioMedium`

            Specifies a unique GUID representing the hardware connection of the TV audio signal. This value enforces connections between filters. Possible values are <b>NULL</b>, indicating that no pin is created; GUID_NULL, indicating that Medium is not used to enforce connections; or a GUID. If a GUID value is used, only crossbar pins with a matching Medium GUID are allowed to connect.
        
            `VideoMedium`

            Specifies a unique GUID representing the hardware connection of the analog video signal. This value enforces connections between filters. Possible values are <b>NULL</b>, indicating that no pin is created; GUID_NULL, indicating that Medium is not used to enforce connections; or a GUID. If a GUID value is used, only crossbar pins with a matching Medium GUID are allowed to connect.
