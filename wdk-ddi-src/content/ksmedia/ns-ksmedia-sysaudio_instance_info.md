# SYSAUDIO_INSTANCE_INFO structure
The SYSAUDIO_INSTANCE_INFO structure specifies which virtual audio device to open and includes flags for configuring that device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct {
  KSPROPERTY Property;
  ULONG      Flags;
  ULONG      DeviceNumber;
} SYSAUDIO_INSTANCE_INFO, *PSYSAUDIO_INSTANCE_INFO;
````

## Members


`DeviceNumber`

Specifies the device ID. This member identifies the virtual audio device that is to be opened by the property request. If SysAudio enumerates <i>N</i> virtual audio devices (see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537419">KSPROPERTY_SYSAUDIO_DEVICE_COUNT</a>), the valid device IDs range from 0 to <i>N</i>-1.

`Flags`

Flags specifying how to configure the virtual audio device. Currently, the only flag bit defined for this parameter is SYSAUDIO_FLAGS_DONT_COMBINE_PINS. If set, this flag bit instructs SysAudio not to combine rendering pins. For more information, see the following Remarks section.

`Property`

Specifies the property. This parameter is a structure of type <a href="..\ks\nf-ks-ikscontrol-ksproperty.md">KSPROPERTY</a>.

## Remarks
This structure is used by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537427">KSPROPERTY_SYSAUDIO_INSTANCE_INFO</a> property.

By default, a virtual audio device combines its wave-rendering pins. The SYSAUDIO_FLAGS_DONT_COMBINE_PINS flag overrides this default.

When pins are combined, the virtual audio device exposes a single pin factory that combines hardware-accelerated rendering pins on the audio device with software-emulated mixer pins on the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/827997e2-6f07-4635-ac35-4ad026b82eae">KMixer system driver</a>. If the pins are not combined, then hardware-accelerated pins and software-emulated pins are exposed through separate pin factories. In order to correctly report the number of hardware-accelerated pins to application programs, DirectSound requires that the pins not be combined.

This property is similar to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537423">KSPROPERTY_SYSAUDIO_DEVICE_INSTANCE</a>, with the exception that it includes flags specifying how to configure the virtual audio device.
