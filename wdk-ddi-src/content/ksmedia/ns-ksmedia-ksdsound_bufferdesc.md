# KSDSOUND_BUFFERDESC structure
The KSDSOUND_BUFFERDESC structure describes a DirectSound buffer.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct {
  ULONG        Flags;
  ULONG        Control;
  WAVEFORMATEX WaveFormatEx;
} KSDSOUND_BUFFERDESC, *PKSDSOUND_BUFFERDESC;
````

## Members


`Control`

Specifies the capabilities of the buffer. The capabilities of a buffer are represented by a set of control flags. This member can be set to the bitwise OR of one or more of the following flag bits:




#### KSDSOUND_BUFFER_CTRL_3D

Indicates that the buffer is either a primary buffer or a secondary buffer with 3D-control capability. If this bit is set, the KS pin representing the buffer implements a 3D node (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537148">KSNODETYPE_3D_EFFECTS</a>). If the KSDSOUND_BUFFER_CTRL_HRTF_3D bit is set, the 3D node supports the optional <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537482">KSPROPSETID_Hrtf3d</a> property set.


#### KSDSOUND_BUFFER_CTRL_FREQUENCY

Indicates that the buffer has frequency-control capability. If this bit is set, the pin representing the buffer implements a sample-rate conversion (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537190">KSNODETYPE_SRC</a>) node.


#### KSDSOUND_BUFFER_CTRL_HRTF_3D

Indicates that the buffer uses a head-related transfer function (HRTF) for 3D control. If this bit is set, then the KSDSOUND_BUFFER_CTRL_3D bit must also be set.


#### KSDSOUND_BUFFER_CTRL_PAN

Indicates that the buffer has pan-control capability. If this bit is set, the pin representing the buffer implements a volume node (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537208">KSNODETYPE_VOLUME</a>) to control panning. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/baca55f5-c669-4bd2-82b5-3985030864f2">DirectSound Node-Ordering Requirements</a>.


#### KSDSOUND_BUFFER_CTRL_VOLUME

Indicates that the buffer has volume-control capability. If this bit is set, the pin representing the buffer implements a volume node (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537208">KSNODETYPE_VOLUME</a>) to control the stream's volume level.


#### KSDSOUND_BUFFER_CTRL_POSITIONNOTIFY

Indicates that the buffer has position-notification capability. If this bit is set, the pin representing the buffer supports the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537297">KSPROPERTY_AUDIO_POSITION</a> property.

`Flags`

Specifies the buffer configuration. This member can be set to the bitwise OR of one or more of the following flag bits:




#### KSDSOUND_BUFFER_PRIMARY

Indicates that the buffer is a primary sound buffer (the buffer the user hears when a game is playing).


#### KSDSOUND_BUFFER_STATIC

Indicates that the buffer will be used for static sound data.


#### KSDSOUND_BUFFER_LOCHARDWARE

Forces the buffer to use hardware mixing.


#### KSDSOUND_BUFFER_LOCSOFTWARE

Forces the buffer to be stored in system memory and use software mixing.

`WaveFormatEx`

Specifies the wave-data format of the buffer. This member is a structure of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff538799">WAVEFORMATEX</a>.

## Remarks
The <a href="..\ksmedia\ns-ksmedia-ksdataformat_dsound.md">KSDATAFORMAT_DSOUND</a> structure contains a <b>BufferDesc</b> member that is a KSDSOUND_BUFFERDESC structure.

Note that the <b>WaveFormatEx</b> member of the KSDSOUND_BUFFERDESC structure can be extended to include additional format information (for example, a channel configuration mask). For details, see <a href="..\ksmedia\ns-ksmedia-waveformatextensible.md">WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE</a>.
