# KSRTAUDIO_GETREADPACKET_INFO structure
The KSRTAUDIO_GETREADPACKET_INFO structure describes information for an audio packet.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _KSRTAUDIO_GETREADPACKET_INFO {
  ULONG                PacketNumber;
  DWORD                Flags;
   ULONG64      PerformanceCounterValue;
  BOOL                  MoreData;
} KSRTAUDIO_GETREADPACKET_INFO, *PKSRTAUDIO_GETREADPACKET_INFO;
````

## Members


`Flags`

Reserved for future use. Must be set to 0.

`MoreData`

Returns TRUE if there is more data ready immediately. The OS may optionally immediately call this routine again after processing the packet to get the next packet information. If the driver returns FALSE, then capture is operating at real time.

`PacketNumber`

Returns the packet number relative to the start of capture.

`PerformanceCounterValue`

Returns the performance counter value corresponding to the sampling instant of the first sample in the packet.
