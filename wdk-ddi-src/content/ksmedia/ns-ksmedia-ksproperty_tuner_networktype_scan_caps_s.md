# KSPROPERTY_TUNER_NETWORKTYPE_SCAN_CAPS_S structure
The KSPROPERTY_TUNER_NETWORKTYPE_SCAN_CAPS_S structure describes the scanning capabilities of a broadcast network type that a tuning device supports.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct {
  KSPROPERTY Property;
  GUID       NetworkType;
  ULONG      BufferSize;
  PVOID      NetworkTunerCapabilities;
} KSPROPERTY_TUNER_NETWORKTYPE_SCAN_CAPS_S, *PKSPROPERTY_TUNER_NETWORKTYPE_SCAN_CAPS_S;
````

## Members


`BufferSize`

The size, in bytes, of the buffer that is required to hold the network capabilities and that the <b>NetworkTunerCapabilities</b> member points to.

`NetworkTunerCapabilities`

A pointer to a buffer to hold the scanning capabilities of a broadcast network type. For example, if the ANALOG_TV_NETWORK_TYPE GUID is set in the <b>NetworkType</b> member, the driver fills the buffer with a populated <a href="..\ksmedia\ns-ksmedia-tuner_analog_caps_s.md">TUNER_ANALOG_CAPS_S</a> structure.

`NetworkType`

A GUID for the broadcast network type for which the tuner filter receives capabilities. The driver returned this GUID as an element in the array that the <b>GUIDBucket</b> member of the <a href="..\ksmedia\ns-ksmedia-ksproperty_tuner_scan_caps_s.md">KSPROPERTY_TUNER_SCAN_CAPS_S</a> structure specifies in a call to the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565887">KSPROPERTY_TUNER_SCAN_CAPS</a> property.

`Property`

Specifies an initialized <a href="..\ks\nf-ks-ikscontrol-ksproperty.md">KSPROPERTY</a> structure that describes the property set, property ID, and request type.
