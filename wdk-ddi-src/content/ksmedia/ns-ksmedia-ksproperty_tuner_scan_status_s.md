# KSPROPERTY_TUNER_SCAN_STATUS_S structure
The KSPROPERTY_TUNER_SCAN_STATUS_S structure describes status for a scanning operation.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct {
  KSPROPERTY    Property;
  TunerLockType LockStatus;
  ULONG         CurrentFrequency;
} KSPROPERTY_TUNER_SCAN_STATUS_S, *PKSPROPERTY_TUNER_SCAN_STATUS_S;
````

## Members


`CurrentFrequency`

The current locked-in frequency, in Hz, on the tuning device.

`LockStatus`

One of the following values from the <b>TunerLockType</b> enumeration that indicates the lock status of the scanning operation.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Status</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<b>Tuner_LockType_None</b> (0x00)

</td>
<td>
The tuner is not locked on a signal. The driver can return this value at the end of a scan.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<b>Tuner_LockType_Within_Scan_Sensing_Range</b> (0x01)

</td>
<td>
The signal is nearby; however, the driver cannot report the exact frequency.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<b>Tuner_LockType_Locked</b> (0x02)

</td>
<td>
A fine-tune signal lock was established. The driver can return this value at the end of a scan.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`Property`

Specifies an initialized <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564262">KSPROPERTY</a> structure that describes the property set, property ID, and request type.
