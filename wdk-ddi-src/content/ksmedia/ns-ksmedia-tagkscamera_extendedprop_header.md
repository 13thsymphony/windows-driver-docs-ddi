# tagKSCAMERA_EXTENDEDPROP_HEADER structure



## -description
The <b>KSCAMERA_EXTENDEDPROP_HEADER</b> structure is the payload header for an extend control property.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _KSCAMERA_EXTENDEDPROP_HEADER {
  ULONG     Version;
  ULONG     PinId;
  ULONG     Size;
  ULONG     Result;
  ULONGLONG Flags;
  ULONGLONG Capability;
} KSCAMERA_EXTENDEDPROP_HEADER, *PKSCAMERA_EXTENDEDPROP_HEADER;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Version

The extended property version number. This is set to 1.


### -field PinId

The pin ID that corresponds with the property.  If <b>PinId</b> is set to (ULONG)-1, the control applies to the filter.  Otherwise, the camera driver must route this control to the corresponding pin when that pin is created (or if already available).


### -field Size

The total size, in bytes of the entire payload. This includes the <b>KSCAMERA_EXTENDEDPROP_HEADER</b> structure and the following control specific payload data.


### -field Result

For a set operation, this is 0.  For queries, <b>Result</b> contains any failure code the driver provides for the most recent control operation.


### -field Flags

The settings in <b>Flags</b> may vary depending on the control.

The high order bit of the <b>Flags</b> value is reserved.  This bit serves as the cancel flag and is defined as <b>KSCAMERA_EXTENDEDPROP_FLAG_CANCELOPERATION</b>.  This flag is only meaningful for asynchronous controls.


### -field Capability

This member is read only and indicates the standard capabilities of the control. The following capabilities are defined.

<table>

<th>Meaning</th>

### -field KSCAMERA_EXTENDEDPROP_CAPS_ASYNCCONTROL

</td>
<td width="60%">
The control supports asynchronous operation.

</tr>
<tr>

### -field KSCAMERA_EXTENDEDPROP_CAPS_CANCELLABLE

</td>
<td width="60%">
Applies only to asynchronous controls. This flag marks the control operation as cancellable. If a synchronous control sets this flag, it is be marked as being invalid and is not exposed to higher level applications.
