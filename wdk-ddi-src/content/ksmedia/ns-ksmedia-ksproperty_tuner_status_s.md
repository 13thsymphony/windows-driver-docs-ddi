# KSPROPERTY_TUNER_STATUS_S structure
The KSPROPERTY_TUNER_STATUS_S structure describes the progress of a tuning operation for TV and radio tuner devices, including present tuning frequency.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct {
  KSPROPERTY Property;
  ULONG      CurrentFrequency;
  ULONG      PLLOffset;
  ULONG      SignalStrength;
  ULONG      Busy;
} KSPROPERTY_TUNER_STATUS_S, *PKSPROPERTY_TUNER_STATUS_S;
````

## Members


`Busy`

Indicates if the minidriver is presently busy with the process of tuning. This member must be set to <b>TRUE</b> if the minidriver is currently tuning to a channel. Otherwise, if the minidriver is not currently tuning to a new channel, this member must be set to <b>FALSE</b>.

`CurrentFrequency`

Specifies the current tuner frequency. This value is in hertz (Hz).

`PLLOffset`

Specifies the phase locked loop (PLL) offset in multiples of the tuning granularity. This is used if the tuner strategy is KS_TUNER_STRATEGY_PLL. If the tuner strategy is not KS_TUNER_STRATEGY_PLL, this value has no meaning. The following table demonstrates the value to be returned by the minidriver for various tuning conditions, assuming the tuning granularity is 62.5kHz:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Frequency Offset</th>
<th>PLLOffset</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
+125,000

</td>
<td>
+2

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
+62,500

</td>
<td>
+1

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Perfectly tuned

</td>
<td>
0

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
-62,500

</td>
<td>
-1

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
-125,000

</td>
<td>
-2

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`Property`

Specifies an initialized <a href="..\ks\nf-ks-ikscontrol-ksproperty.md">KSPROPERTY</a> structure that describes the property set, property ID, and request type.

`SignalStrength`

Specifies the amplitude of the signal. This is used if the tuner strategy is KS_TUNER_STRATEGY_SIGNAL_STRENGTH. Regardless of the tuning strategy supported by the minidriver, the valid values for this member are:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
-1

</td>
<td>
Strength not Available.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
0

</td>
<td>
Not on an acceptable frequency.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
1

</td>
<td>
On an acceptable frequency.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks
For more information about the <b>PLLOffset</b> and <b>SignalStrength</b> members see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ae97d5f7-82de-4d6e-9835-ff4c7427f333">PCI based TV capture</a>. If your tuner device supports radio tuning, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/36e3ca98-cb1b-46cc-809a-8c9ad08a53c8">Video Capture Devices with Radio Tuners</a>.
