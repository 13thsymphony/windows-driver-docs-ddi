# _timecode structure
The TIMECODE union describes a timecode from an external device. This structure is no longer used.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct _timecode {
  struct {
    DWORD dwFrames;
    WORD  wFrameFract;
    WORD  wFrameRate;
  };
  DWORDLONG qw;
} TIMECODE;
```

## Members


`qw`

Specifies the timecode as a quad-word.

## Remarks
This structure is defined for the purpose of searching to a timecode based on an absolute track number (ATN) and/or relative time counter (RTC). However, not all devices support searching to a timecode using this structure.

## Requirements
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| ---- |:---- |
| **Header** | ksmedia.h (include Ksmedia.h) |
