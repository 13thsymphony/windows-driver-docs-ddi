# RxPrefixTableLookupName function



## -description
<b>RxPrefixTableLookupName</b> looks up a name in a prefix table used to catalog SRV_CALL, NET_ROOT, and V_NET_ROOT names and converts the underlying pointer to a structure that contains the name.



## -syntax

````
PVOID RxPrefixTableLookupName(
  _In_  PRX_PREFIX_TABLE  ThisTable,
  _In_  PUNICODE_STRING   CanonicalName,
  _Out_ PUNICODE_STRING   RemainingName,
  _In_  PRX_CONNECTION_ID RxConnectionId
);
````


## -parameters

### -param ThisTable [in]

A pointer to the RX_PREFIX_TABLE structure in which to look.


### -param CanonicalName [in]

A pointer to the Unicode string name to look up.


### -param RemainingName [out]

A pointer to the Unicode string name of the portion of the name that was unmatched.


### -param RxConnectionId [in]

An optional parameter that represents a pointer to the RX_CONNECTION_ID to be used.


## -returns
<b>RxPrefixTableLookupName</b> returns a pointer to the node that was found if a match is found. If no match is found, <b>RxPrefixTableLookupName</b> returns a <b>NULL</b> pointer. 


## -remarks
This routine is used internally by RDBSS in response to a call from MUP to claim a name or form the create path for a NET_ROOT or V_NET_ROOT structure. The <b>RxPrefixTableLookupName</b> routine can also be used by network mini-redirectors as long as the appropriate lock is acquired before accessing the table, and the lock is released when work is completed. The normal use by a driver would be as follows:

Acquire a shared lock by calling <b>RxpAcquirePrefixTableLockShared</b>.

Look up a name by calling <b>RxPrefixTableLookupName</b>.

Release the shared lock by calling <b>RxpReleasePrefixTableLock</b>.

Note that if a match is found, the reference count on the found node will be incremented. 

On checked builds, <b>RxPrefixTableLookupName</b> causes the system to ASSERT if the length of the <i>CanonicalName</i> string is not greater than zero.
