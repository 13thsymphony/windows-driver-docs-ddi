# RxPrefixTableLookupName function
<b>RxPrefixTableLookupName</b> looks up a name in a prefix table used to catalog SRV_CALL, NET_ROOT, and V_NET_ROOT names and converts the underlying pointer to a structure that contains the name.

## Syntax

````
PVOID RxPrefixTableLookupName(
  _In_  PRX_PREFIX_TABLE  ThisTable,
  _In_  PUNICODE_STRING   CanonicalName,
  _Out_ PUNICODE_STRING   RemainingName,
  _In_  PRX_CONNECTION_ID RxConnectionId
);
````

## Parameters

`ThisTable`

A pointer to the RX_PREFIX_TABLE structure in which to look.

`CanonicalName`

A pointer to the Unicode string name to look up.

`RemainingName`

A pointer to the Unicode string name of the portion of the name that was unmatched.

`ConnectionId`

TBD


## Return Value

<b>RxPrefixTableLookupName</b> returns a pointer to the node that was found if a match is found. If no match is found, <b>RxPrefixTableLookupName</b> returns a <b>NULL</b> pointer.

## Remarks

This routine is used internally by RDBSS in response to a call from MUP to claim a name or form the create path for a NET_ROOT or V_NET_ROOT structure. The <b>RxPrefixTableLookupName</b> routine can also be used by network mini-redirectors as long as the appropriate lock is acquired before accessing the table, and the lock is released when work is completed. The normal use by a driver would be as follows:
<ul>
<li>
Acquire a shared lock by calling <b>RxpAcquirePrefixTableLockShared</b>.

</li>
<li>
Look up a name by calling <b>RxPrefixTableLookupName</b>.

</li>
<li>
Release the shared lock by calling <b>RxpReleasePrefixTableLock</b>.

</li>
</ul>Note that if a match is found, the reference count on the found node will be incremented. 

On checked builds, <b>RxPrefixTableLookupName</b> causes the system to ASSERT if the length of the <i>CanonicalName</i> string is not greater than zero.
