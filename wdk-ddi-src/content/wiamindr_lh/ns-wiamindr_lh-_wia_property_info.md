# _WIA_PROPERTY_INFO structure
The WIA_PROPERTY_INFO structure is used to store default access and valid value information for an item property of arbitrary type.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _WIA_PROPERTY_INFO {
  ULONG   lAccessFlags;
  VARTYPE vt;
  union {
    struct {
      LONG Min;
      LONG Nom;
      LONG Max;
      LONG Inc;
    } Range;
    struct {
      DOUBLE Min;
      DOUBLE Nom;
      DOUBLE Max;
      DOUBLE Inc;
    } RangeFloat;
    struct {
      LONG cNumList;
      LONG Nom;
      BYTE *pList;
    } List;
    struct {
      LONG   cNumList;
      DOUBLE Nom;
      BYTE   *pList;
    } ListFloat;
    struct {
      LONG cNumList;
      GUID Nom;
      GUID *pList;
    } ListGuid;
    struct {
      LONG cNumList;
      BSTR Nom;
      BSTR *pList;
    } ListBStr;
    struct {
      LONG Nom;
      LONG ValidBits;
    } Flag;
    struct {
      LONG Dummy;
    } None;
  } ValidVal;
} WIA_PROPERTY_INFO, *PWIA_PROPERTY_INFO;

## Members

        
            `lAccessFlags`

            Specifies the access and property attribute flags for a property. See the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation for a list of WIA property attribute flags.
        
            `ValidVal`

            
        
            `vt`

            Specifies the variant data type for the property. This member, which can be one of the following, controls which structure member of the <b>ValidValunion</b> is valid:

<dl>
<dd>
VT_UI1

</dd>
<dd>
VT_UI2

</dd>
<dd>
VT_UI4

</dd>
<dd>
VT_I2

</dd>
<dd>
VT_I4

</dd>
<dd>
VT_R4

</dd>
<dd>
VT_R8

</dd>
<dd>
VT_CLSID

</dd>
<dd>
VT_BSTR

</dd>
</dl>
See PROPVARIANT in the Windows SDK documentation for more information.

    ## Remarks
        The WIA_PROPERTY_INFO is used by the minidriver to store information about a property of arbitrary type. This structure is also used by the <b>wiasSetItemPropAttribs</b> to set a property's valid values. The <b>lAccessFlags</b> member controls whether access to a property is read-only or read/write. This member also conveys information about the set of valid values for a property when they are defined by a list of values, a range of values, or a bitset of flags. The <b>vt</b> member contains information about the type of the property. Both members should be used to determine which member of the <b>ValidValunion</b> can be accessed. 

For example, for a read/write property of type <b>long</b>, whose valid values are integers in the range -128 to 127, and whose nominal value is 0, <b>lAccessFlags</b> would be set to WIA_PROP_RW | WIA_PROP_RANGE, and <b>vt</b> would be set to VT_I4. <b>Range.Min</b> would be set to -128, <b>Range.Max</b> would be set to 127, and <b>Range.Inc</b> would be set to 1. <b>Range.Nom</b> would be set to 0.

For a different property whose valid values are defined by a list of three GUID values, <b>lAccessFlags</b> would have its WIA_PROP_LIST bit set, and <b>vt</b> would be set to VT_CLSID. <b>ListGuid.cNumList</b> would be set to 3, and the three GUIDs are <b>ListGuid.pList</b>[0], <b>ListGuid.pList</b>[1], and <b>ListGuid.pList</b>[2].

A property whose valid values are defined by a bitset of the values 0x01, 0x02, 0x04, and 0x08 would have the WIA_PROP_FLAG bit set in <b>lAccessFlags</b>, and <b>vt</b> would be set to VT_UI4. For such a property, the value stored in <b>Flag.ValidBits</b> would be 0x0F, the bitwise OR of the four flag values previously mentioned.

The following examples show how to use array data with WIA_PROPERTY_INFO and how to call <a href="..\wiamdef\nf-wiamdef-wiaswritemultiple.md">wiasWriteMultiple</a> to set your property values.

Initialization might look like the following example:

At run time, changing the value with <b>wiasWriteMultiple</b> might look like the following example:

<b>Note</b>  WIA uses the COM PROPVARIANT type, VARIANT (defined in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation), so the default is VT_VECTOR, and not VT_ARRAY (which is also supported).
