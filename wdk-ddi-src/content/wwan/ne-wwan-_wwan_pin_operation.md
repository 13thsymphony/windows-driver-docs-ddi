# _WWAN_PIN_OPERATION Enumeration
The WWAN_PIN_OPERATION enumeration lists the different Personal Identification Number (PIN)
  operations that are supported by the MB device.

## Syntax
```
typedef enum _WWAN_PIN_OPERATION {
  WwanPinOperationEnter    ,
  WwanPinOperationEnable   ,
  WwanPinOperationDisable  ,
  WwanPinOperationChange   ,
  WwanPinOperationMax
} WWAN_PIN_OPERATION, *PWWAN_PIN_OPERATION;
```

## Constants

<table>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>WwanPinOperationEnter</td>
                    <td>Enter the specified PIN into the device.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>WwanPinOperationEnable</td>
                    <td>Enable the specified PIN.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>WwanPinOperationDisable</td>
                    <td>Disable the specified PIN.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>WwanPinOperationChange</td>
                    <td>Change the specified PIN.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>WwanPinOperationMax</td>
                    <td>The total number of supported PIN operations.</td>
                </tr>
</table>

## Remarks

If a PIN disable operation for a given PIN type is tried when that PIN type is locked, miniport
    drivers can either fail the request with WWAN_STATUS_PIN_REQUIRED or they can successfully complete the
    request. If miniport drivers complete the request successfully, the disable operation should also unlock
    the PIN.
