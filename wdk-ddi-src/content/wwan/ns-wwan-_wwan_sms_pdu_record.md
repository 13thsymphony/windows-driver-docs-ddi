# _WWAN_SMS_PDU_RECORD structure
The WWAN_SMS_PDU_RECORD structure represents a PDU-style SMS message record.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _WWAN_SMS_PDU_RECORD {
  ULONG           MessageIndex;
  WWAN_MSG_STATUS MsgStatus;
  BYTE            Size;
  CHAR            PduData[WWAN_SMS_PDU_HEX_BUF_LEN];
} WWAN_SMS_PDU_RECORD, *PWWAN_SMS_PDU_RECORD;
````

## Members


`MessageIndex`

An index into the virtual message store that is maintained by the miniport driver. This index is
     1-based and the maximum index is 
     <b>ulMaxMessageIndex</b> returned in WWAN_SMS_CONFIGURATION_STATUS. Be aware that the specification does
     not differentiate between physically available data stores. If the message is a Class 0 (flash/alert)
     message, this must be set to WWAN_MESSAGE_INDEX_NONE.

`MsgStatus`

The status of the record that represents whether the SMS message is new (unread), old (read), a
     draft, or sent.

`PduData`

For GSM-based devices, a NULL-terminated string that contains the content of the record coded in a
     hexadecimal string format (according to the 3GPP TS 27.005 and 3GPP TS 23.040 standards) that represents
     the SMS message. 
     

For CDMA-based devices that support reading SMS messages in binary format (as returned in
     WWAN_SMS_CAPS as WWAN_SMS_CAPS_PDU_RECEIVE) this member contains the SMS message as a byte array, as
     defined in section 3.4.2.1 SMS Point-to-Point Message in 3GPP2 specification C.S0015-A "Short Message
     Service (SMS) for Wideband Spread Spectrum Systems". SMS will only support Wireless Messaging
     Teleservice (WMT) format. Miniport drivers should typecast this information to BYTE[] for CDMA-based
     devices. It is not coded in hexadecimal string format. The message is not NULL-terminated.

`Size`

The size, in bytes, of the record.
     

For GSM-based devices, this represents the size of the message before conversion to a hexadecimal
     string.

For CDMA-based devices, this represents the number of bytes in the 
     <b>PduData</b> .
