# _WWAN_SYS_CAPS_INFO structure



## -description
The <b>WWAN_SYS_CAPS_INFO</b> structure represents the modem's system capability.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct WWAN_SYS_CAPS_INFO {
  ULONG  NumberOfExecutors;
  ULONG  NumberOfSlots;
  ULONG  Concurrency;
  UINT64 ModemID;
} WWAN_SYS_CAPS_INFO, *PWWAN_SYS_CAPS_INFO;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field NumberOfExecutors

Denotes the number of <i>executors</i> (MBB instances) that are supported by the modem in its current configuration.


### -field NumberOfSlots

Denotes the number of slots that are physically present on the modem. Each slot reported must be capable of receiving a UICC card; the slots themselves can be a heterogeneous mix if needed - mini SIM, micro SIM, nano SIM, or any standard as defined by ETSI. The number of slots <b>must</b> be at least equal to or greater than the number of executors supported. The "greater than" provision allows for the use of non-telephony UICC cards (such as for security, NFC, etc.).


### -field Concurrency

Denotes the number of executors that may be active at the same time, where 1 ≤ Concurrency ≤ NumberOfExecutors. For example, a dual-standby modem would have a <b>Concurrency</b> of 1 while a dual-active modem would have a <b>Concurrency</b> of 2.


### -field ModemID

A unique 64-bit number that identifies the modem. This is required to distinguish one modem from others if there is more than one modem present in a device. The modem ID should be constant across reboots or device removal and insertion.
