# _WWAN_TDSCDMA_MRL_INFO structure
The <b>WWAN_TDSCDMA_MRL_INFO</b> structure represents information about a neighboring TDSCDMA cell.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _WWAN_TDSCDMA_MRL_INFO {
  ULONG ProviderIdOffset;
  ULONG ProviderIdSize;
  ULONG LocationAreaCode;
  ULONG CellId;
  ULONG UARFCN;
  ULONG CellParameterID;
  ULONG TimingAdvance;
  ULONG RSCP;
  ULONG PathLoss;
  BYTE  Data[ANYSIZE_ARRAY];
} WWAN_TDSCDMA_MRL_INFO, *PWWAN_TDSCDMA_MRL_INFO;
````

## Members


`CellId`

The Cell ID (0-268435455). Use 0xFFFFFFFF when this information is not available.

`CellParameterId`



`Data`



`LocationAreaCode`

The Location Area Code (0-65535). Use 0xFFFFFFFF when this information is not available.

`PathLoss`

The path loss of the serving cell (46-158). Use 0xFFFFFFFF when this information is not available.

`ProviderIdOffset`

The offset in bytes, calculated from the beginning of this structure, to a numeric (0-9) string called <i>ProviderId</i> that represents the network provider identity. This string is a concatenation of a three-digit Mobile Country Code (MCC) and a two or three-digit Mobile Network Code (MNC). This member can be NULL when no <i>ProviderId</i> information is returned.

`ProviderIdSize`

The size, in bytes, used for <i>ProviderId</i>.

`RSCP`

The Received Signal Code Power of the serving cell. The range is -120 to -25, in units of 1dBm in Q8 L3 filtered. Use 0xFFFFFFFF when this information is not available.

`TimingAdvance`

The Timing Advance (0-1023). This member is the same value for all timeslots. Use 0xFFFFFFFF when this information is not available.

`UARFCN`

The UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number for the serving cell (0-16383). Use 0xFFFFFFFF when this information is not available.
