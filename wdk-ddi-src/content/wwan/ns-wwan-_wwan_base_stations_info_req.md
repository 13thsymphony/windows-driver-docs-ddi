# _WWAN_BASE_STATIONS_INFO_REQ structure
The <b>WWAN_BASE_STATIONS_INFO_REQ</b> structure represents the aspects of cellular base stations information that are requested in a base stations information query.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _WWAN_BASE_STATIONS_INFO_REQ {
  ULONG MaxGSMCount;
  ULONG MaxUMTSCount;
  ULONG MaxTDSCDMACount;
  ULONG MaxLTECount;
  ULONG MaxCDMACount;
} WWAN_BASE_STATIONS_INFO_REQ, *PWWAN_BASE_STATIONS_INFO_REQ;
