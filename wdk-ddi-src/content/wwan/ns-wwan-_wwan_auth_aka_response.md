# _WWAN_AUTH_AKA_RESPONSE structure



## -description
The WWAN_AUTH_AKA_RESPONSE structure represents a response to an AKA authentication challenge.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _WWAN_AUTH_AKA_RESPONSE {
  BYTE  Res[WWAN_AUTH_RES_MAX_LEN];
  ULONG ResLength;
  BYTE  IK[WWAN_AUTH_IK_LEN];
  BYTE  CK[WWAN_AUTH_CK_LEN];
  BYTE  Auts[WWAN_AUTH_AUTS_LEN];
} WWAN_AUTH_AKA_RESPONSE, *PWWAN_AUTH_AKA_RESPONSE;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Res[WWAN_AUTH_RES_MAX_LEN]

128-bit authentication result from the peer, which, together with the RAND, authenticates the peer to the server. This member is valid only in case of success. This member represents a multi-byte value in little-endian format.


### -field ResLength

Length of response in the <b>Res</b> member.


### -field IK[WWAN_AUTH_IK_LEN]

Integrating key. This member is valid only in case of success. This member represents a multi-byte value in little-endian format.


### -field CK[WWAN_AUTH_CK_LEN]

Ciphering key. This member is valid only in case of success. This member represents a multi-byte value in little-endian format.


### -field Auts[WWAN_AUTH_AUTS_LEN]

112-bit value generated by the peer upon a synchronization failure. This member is valid only in case of failure. This member represents a multi-byte value in little-endian format.
