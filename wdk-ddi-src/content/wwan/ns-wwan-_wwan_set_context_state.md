# _WWAN_SET_CONTEXT_STATE structure
The WWAN_SET_CONTEXT_STATE structure represents the command to set the Packet Data Protocol (PDP)
  context state of the MB device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _WWAN_SET_CONTEXT_STATE {
  ULONG                   ConnectionId;
  WWAN_ACTIVATION_COMMAND ActivationCommand;
  WCHAR                   AccessString[WWAN_ACCESSSTRING_LEN];
  WCHAR                   UserName[WWAN_USERNAME_LEN];
  WCHAR                   Password[WWAN_PASSWORD_LEN];
  WWAN_COMPRESSION        Compression;
  WWAN_AUTH_PROTOCOL      AuthType;
  WWAN_IP_TYPE            IPType;
} WWAN_SET_CONTEXT_STATE, *PWWAN_SET_CONTEXT_STATE;
````

## Members

        
            `AccessString`

            A NULL-terminated string to access the network. For GSM-based networks, this would be an Access
     Point Name (APN) string such as "data.thephone-company.com". For CDMA-based networks, this might be a
     special dial code such as "#777" or a Network Access Identifier (NAI) such as
     "foo@thephone-company.com". This member can be <b>NULL</b>.
     

The size of the string should not exceed 100 bytes.
        
            `ActivationCommand`

            Activate or deactivate a PDP context that is referenced in the 
     <b>ConnectionId</b> member. The following table shows the possible values a miniport driver can specify.
     

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WwanActivationCommandActivate

</td>
<td>
Activate PDP context referred to by 
        <b>ConnectionId</b> .

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WwanActivationCommandDeactivate

</td>
<td>
Deactivate a currently activated PDP context referred by 
        <b>ConnectionId</b> .

</td>
</tr>
</table>
        
            `AuthType`

            A value from the WWAN_AUTH_PROTOCOL enumeration that specifies the authentication type to use for
     the PDP activation. This member applies only to GSM-based devices. The MB Service sets this member to 
     <b>WwanAuthProtocolNone</b> for CDMA-based devices.
     

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WwanAuthProtocolNone

</td>
<td>
No authentication protocol.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WwanAuthProtocolPap

</td>
<td>
Unencrypted password authentication.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WwanAuthProtocolChap

</td>
<td>
Use the Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP).

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WwanAuthProtocolMsChapV2

</td>
<td>
Use the Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) v2.0.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
        
            `Compression`

            A value from the WWAN_COMPRESSION enumeration that specifies whether compression should be used in
     the data connection for header and data. This member applies only to GSM-based devices. The MB Service
     sets this member to 
     <b>WwanCompressionNone</b> for CDMA-based devices.
     

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WwanCompressionNone

</td>
<td>
No compression is applied.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WwanCompressionEnable

</td>
<td>
Enable header and data compression.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
        
            `ConnectionId`

            MB Service specifies this member to uniquely identify the PDP Context and its corresponding state.
     

The MB Service uses the value in this member to uniquely identify the current active context across
     MB network adapters.

The miniport driver must use the value in this member when completing 
     <i>set</i> requests. The MB Service uses the value in this member in subsequent 
     <i>query</i> requests as well as disconnect requests to the miniport driver.
        
            `IPType`

            A value from the WWAN_IP_TYPE enumeration that specifies the type of IP.
        
            `Password`

            A NULL-terminated string that represents the username's password. This member can be <b>NULL</b>.
        
            `UserName`

            A NULL-terminated string that represents the username to authenticate. This member can be
     <b>NULL</b>.
