# _WWAN_SET_CONTEXT structure
The WWAN_SET_CONTEXT structure represents a provisioned context with a network provider
  identification that is supported by the MB device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _WWAN_SET_CONTEXT {
  ULONG              ContextId;
  WWAN_CONTEXT_TYPE  ContextType;
  WCHAR              AccessString[WWAN_ACCESSSTRING_LEN];
  WCHAR              UserName[WWAN_USERNAME_LEN];
  WCHAR              Password[WWAN_PASSWORD_LEN];
  WWAN_COMPRESSION   Compression;
  WWAN_AUTH_PROTOCOL AuthType;
  WCHAR              ProviderId[WWAN_PROVIDERID_LEN];
} WWAN_SET_CONTEXT, *PWWAN_SET_CONTEXT;
````

## Members


`AccessString`

A NULL-terminated string to access the network. For GSM-based networks, this would be an Access
     Point Name (APN) string such as "data.thephone-company.com". For CDMA-based networks, this might be a
     special dial code such as "#777" or a Network Access Identifier (NAI) such as
     "foo@thephone-company.com". This member can be <b>NULL</b>.
     

The size of the string should not exceed 100 bytes.

`AuthType`

Authentication type to use for the PDP activation.

`Compression`

Specifies the compression to be used in the data connection for header and data. This member
     applies only to GSM-based devices. The MB Service sets this member to 
     <b>WwanCompressionNone</b> for CDMA-based devices.

`ContextId`

A unique ID for this context.
     

For 
     <i>set</i> OID_WWAN_PROVISIONED_CONTEXT requests, the MB Service can set the value to
     WWAN_CONTEXT_ID_APPEND. If this value is used, the miniport driver should decide the index for storing
     the context information. WWAN_CONTEXT_ID_APPEND should never be returned in response to 
     <i>query</i> OID_WWAN_PROVISIONED_CONTEXT requests.

`ContextType`

Specifies the type of context being represented, for example, Internet connectivity, VPN (a
     connection to a corporate network), or Voice-over-IP (VOIP). Miniport drivers should specify 
     <b>WwanContextTypeNone</b> for empty or unprovisioned contexts.

`Password`

The password to use for authentication. This member can be <b>NULL</b>.

`ProviderId`

A NULL-terminated string that represents the network provider identification for which the
     provisioned context should be stored in 
     <i>set</i> OID_WWAN_PROVISIONED_CONTEXT requests. Miniport drivers should return the added provisioned
     context in response to subsequent 
     <i>query</i> operations when a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM card) with this home provider ID is in the
     device.

`UserName`

The username to use for authentication. This member can be <b>NULL</b>.
