# _WWAN_SMS_CONFIGURATION structure
The WWAN_SMS_CONFIGURATION structure represents the SMS configuration of the MB device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _WWAN_SMS_CONFIGURATION {
  CHAR            ScAddress[WWAN_SMS_ADDRESS_MAX_LEN];
  WWAN_SMS_FORMAT SmsFormat;
  ULONG           ulMaxMessageIndex;
} WWAN_SMS_CONFIGURATION, *PWWAN_SMS_CONFIGURATION;
````

## Members


`ScAddress`

A NULL-terminated string with a maximum length of 15 digits that represents the Service Center
     (SC) address. This member is used by all text messages for sending and receiving. For PDU-style SMS
     messages, this information is used if it is not available in PDU data.
     

The number can be in any of the following formats:
<ul>
<li>
"+ &lt;International Country Code&gt; &lt;SMS Service Center Number&gt;\0"

</li>
<li>
"&lt;SMS Service Center Number&gt;\0"

</li>
</ul>For set requests, the MB Service can set this member to <b>NULL</b>. In this case, a <b>NULL</b> indicates the
     miniport driver does not need to update the 
     <b>ScAddress</b> member and should not update this member thereafter.

`SmsFormat`

The SMS message format that should be used for the unsolicited indication of new SMS message
     arrivals. CDMA-based devices support only the 
     <b>WwanSmsFormatCdma</b> format. The 
     <b>WwanSmsFormatCdma</b> format does not apply to GSM-based devices.

`ulMaxMessageIndex`

The maximum number of messages that can be stored on the device. Miniport drivers report this
     value for 
     <i>query</i> requests. Unsolicited events that are used to notify the change of 
     <b>ScAddress</b> must also contain valid information for this member.

## Remarks
Miniport drivers need to fill in this data structure only when processing 
    <i>query</i> requests, or in case of unsolicited events.

## Requirements
