# _WWAN_SERVICE_ACTIVATION_STATUS structure
The WWAN_SERVICE_ACTIVATION_STATUS structure represents the status of service activation on the MB
  device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _WWAN_SERVICE_ACTIVATION_STATUS {
  ULONG uNwError;
  ULONG uVendorSpecificBufferSize;
} WWAN_SERVICE_ACTIVATION_STATUS, *PWWAN_SERVICE_ACTIVATION_STATUS;
````

## Members


`uNwError`

A network-specific error, if any, that is returned by the network provider. Miniport drivers
     should populate this member only if 
     <b>uStatus</b> does not equal WWAN_STATUS_SUCCESS.

`uVendorSpecificBufferSize`

The size, in bytes, of the vendor-specific buffer that follows the structure instance in
     memory.
