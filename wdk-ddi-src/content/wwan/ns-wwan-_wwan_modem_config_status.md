# _WWAN_MODEM_CONFIG_STATUS structure
The <b>WWAN_MODEM_CONFIG_STATUS</b> structure represents a modem's configuration (config) status.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _WWAN_MODEM_CONFIG_STATUS {
  WWAN_MODEM_CONFIG_STATE  ConfigState;
  WWAN_MODEM_CONFIG_REASON ConfigReason;
  ULONG                    PreviousConfigID;
  ULONG                    CurrentConfigID;
  DWORD                    DefaultOrNot;
} WWAN_MODEM_CONFIG_STATUS, *PWWAN_MODEM_CONFIG_STATUS;
````

## Members


`ConfigReason`

The reason why the modem's config state change was triggered. For a list of defined values, see <a href="..\wwan\ne-wwan-_wwan_modem_config_reason.md">WWAN_MODEM_CONFIG_REASON</a>.

`ConfigState`

The modem's config state. For a list of defined values, see <a href="..\wwan\ne-wwan-_wwan_modem_config_state.md">WWAN_MODEM_CONFIG_STATE</a>.

`CurrentConfigID`

The current config file's Config ID.

`DefaultOrNot`

Indicates if the default config file was selected, if available.

`PreviousConfigID`

The previous config file's Config ID.

## Remarks
Modem config files are identified using a Config ID, defined as a UUID whose value is determined by the IHV vendor. The value of each Config ID is unique and can be generated statically or dynamically. A Config ID of zero (00000000-0000-0000-000000000000) is a special case, meaning the Config ID is not available.

The config file's Config ID is reported to the OS during the config state change. When <b>ConfigState</b> is <i>Pending</i>, <b>PreviousConfigID</b> points to the previously activated modem config file or zero if there was no previously activated config file (such as during the device's first boot). The <b>CurrentConfigID</b> must always be set to zero when <b>ConfigState</b> is <i>Pending</i>.

When <b>ConfigState</b> is <i>Activated</i>, <b>PreviousConfigID</b> will be the same as in the <i>Pending</i> state but <b>CurrentConfigID</b> will point to a newly activated config file. In a case where no activation is required, <b>CurrentConfigID</b> will point to the existing <b>CurrentConfigID</b>.

If, during the modem config selection process, no match is found for existing custom config files, then a default config file is selected if available. The MBB driver indicates this by setting <b>DefaultOrNot</b> to TRUE. If no default config file exists, <b>CurrentConfigID</b> must be set to zero and <b>DefaultOrNot</b> must be set to FALSE. <b>DefaultOrNot</b> is only valid when <b>ConfigState</b> is <i>Activated</i>.

If the modem config selection process is triggered by SIM removal or no SIM, <b>CurrentConfigID</b> can be set either to 0 or <b>PreviousConfigID</b> in the <i>Activated</i> state. If the modem is removing the currently activated configuration, then <b>CurrentConfigID</b> will be set to zero. Otherwise, it will be set to the value of the previously activated configuration.

If the same config file is selected as the currently activated one, the MBB driver is not required to send a notification to the upper layer.
