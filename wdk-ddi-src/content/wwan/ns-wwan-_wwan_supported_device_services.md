# _WWAN_SUPPORTED_DEVICE_SERVICES structure
The WWAN_SUPPORTED_DEVICE_SERVICES structure describes information about device services supported by the miniport driver.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _WWAN_SUPPORTED_DEVICE_SERVICES {
  ULONG            uMaxCommandDataSize;
  ULONG            uMaxSessionDataSize;
  ULONG            uMaxSessionCount;
  WWAN_LIST_HEADER ListHeader;
} WWAN_SUPPORTED_DEVICE_SERVICES, *PWWAN_SUPPORTED_DEVICE_SERVICES;
````

## Members


`ListHeader`

A formatted WWAN_LIST_HEADER object that represents a list of supported device services and the number of services  in the list.

This member points to the list of the <a href="..\wwan\ns-wwan-_wwan_device_service_entry.md">WWAN_DEVICE_SERVICE_ENTRY</a> by using the WWAN_LIST_HEADER structure.

`uMaxCommandDataSize`

The maximum size, in bytes, of data that can be associated with a device service command.

`uMaxSessionCount`

The maximum number of device service sessions supported by the miniport driver.

`uMaxSessionDataSize`

The maximum size, in bytes, of data that can be associated with a device service session.
