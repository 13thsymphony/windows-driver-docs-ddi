# _WWAN_PIN_DESC structure
The WWAN_PIN_DESC structure represents the description or current status for a Personal
  Identification Number (PIN).

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _WWAN_PIN_DESC {
  WWAN_PIN_MODE   PinMode;
  WWAN_PIN_FORMAT PinFormat;
  ULONG           PinLengthMin;
  ULONG           PinLengthMax;
} WWAN_PIN_DESC, *PWWAN_PIN_DESC;
````

## Members


`PinFormat`

The format of the PIN. This member is ignored if the 
     <b>PinMode</b> is 
     <b>WwanPinModeNotSupported</b>.

`PinLengthMax`

The maximum number of characters in the PIN. Miniport drivers should not specify a value that is
     greater than WWAN_PIN_LEN (12). Miniport drivers should specify WWAN_PIN_LENGTH_UNKNOWN, if the PIN
     length is not available.

`PinLengthMin`

The minimum number of characters in the PIN. Miniport drivers should not specify a value that is
     greater than WWAN_PIN_LEN (12). Miniport drivers should specify WWAN_PIN_LENGTH_UNKNOWN, if the PIN
     length is not available.

`PinMode`

The current status of the PIN.
