# _WWAN_CONTEXT_TYPE enumeration



## -description
The WWAN_CONTEXT_TYPE enumeration lists the different types of connection contexts that are supported
  by the MB device.



## -syntax

````
typedef enum _WWAN_CONTEXT_TYPE { 
  WwanContextTypeNone        = 0,
  WwanContextTypeInternet,
  WwanContextTypeVpn,
  WwanContextTypeVoice,
  WwanContextTypeVideoShare,
  WwanContextTypeCustom,
  WwanContextTypePurchase,
  WwanContextTypeMax
} WWAN_CONTEXT_TYPE, *PWWAN_CONTEXT_TYPE;
````


## -enum-fields

### -field WwanContextTypeNone

The context is not yet provisioned.


### -field WwanContextTypeInternet

The context represents a connection to the Internet.


### -field WwanContextTypeVpn

The context represents a connection to virtual private network (VPN to a corporate
     network).


### -field WwanContextTypeVoice

The context represents a connection to a Voice-over-IP (VOIP) service.


### -field WwanContextTypeVideoShare

The context represents a connection to a video sharing service.


### -field WwanContextTypeCustom

The context represents a connection to a custom service.


### -field WwanContextTypePurchase

This enumeration indicates the usage of the provisioned context. For example, whether the context is
    used to connect to the Internet, or to a VPN into a corporate network. Miniport driver should specify 
    <b>WwanContextTypeNone</b> for empty (unprovisioned) context slots.
