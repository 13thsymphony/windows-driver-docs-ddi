# _WWAN_UICCSLOT_STATE enumeration



## -description
The <b>WWAN_UICCSLOT_STATE</b> enumeration lists the different states of a UICC (SIM) card slot on a modem. The slot state represents a summary of both the slot state and the card state.



## -syntax

````
typedef enum _WWAN_UICCSLOT_STATE { 
  UICCSlotStateUnknown,
  UICCSlotStateOffEmpty,
  UICCSlotStateOff,
  UICCSlotStateEmpty,
  UICCSlotStateNotReady,
  UICCSlotStateActive,
  UICCSlotStateError
} WWAN_UICCSLOT_STATE;
````


## -enum-fields

### -field UICCSlotStateUnknown

The modem is still in the process of initializing so the SIM slot state is not deterministic.


### -field UICCSlotStateOffEmpty

The card slot is powered off and empty. An implementation that is unable to determine the presence of a card in a slot that is powered off reports its state as <i>Off</i>.


### -field UICCSlotStateOff

The card slot is powered off and a card is present.


### -field UICCSlotStateEmpty

The card slot is powered on but no card is present.


### -field UICCSlotStateNotReady

The card in the slot is not ready; i.e., it has been reset but has not finished initializing. It cannot be used at this time.


### -field UICCSlotStateActive

The card in the slot is available and ready to accept commands. This has no association with the SIM PIN locked state.


### -field UICCSlotStateError

The card in the slot is in an error state and cannot be used.


## -remarks
The set of reported states is constrained by the capability of the slot hardware. In the most restrictive case, the slot hardware may only be able to determine that a card is present when it is powered on and active; in such a case the <b>OffEmpty</b> and <b>Off</b> states will not be reported.
