# _WWAN_SMS_FILTER structure



## -description
The WWAN_SMS_FILTER structure represents the filter to apply to SMS messages on the MB device.


## -syntax

````
typedef struct _WWAN_SMS_FILTER {
  WWAN_SMS_FLAG Flag;
  ULONG         MessageIndex;
} WWAN_SMS_FILTER, *PWWAN_SMS_FILTER;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Flag

A value from the WWAN_SMS_FLAG enumeration that represents what filter to use to display SMS
     messages for.

### -field MessageIndex

A value between 1 and 
     <i>ulMaxMessageIndex</i> that is an index into the device's message store.
     
This value in this member is valid only if 
     <b>Flag</b> is set to 
     <b>WwanSmsFlagIndex</b>. The MB Service sets this member if 
     <b>Flag</b> is set to 
     <b>WwanSmsFlagIndex</b>. For all flags other than 
     <b>WwanSmsFlagIndex</b>, the MB Service sets this index to WWAN_MESSAGE_INDEX_NONE.

## -remarks
When 
    <b>Flag</b> is 
    <b>WwanSmsFlagIndex</b>, the filter identifies the SMS message specified by 
    <b>MessageIndex</b> .
