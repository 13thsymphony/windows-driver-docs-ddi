# _WWAN_SIM_CLASS Enumeration
The WWAN_SIM_CLASS enumeration lists the different types of Subscriber Identity Modules (SIMs) that
  are supported by the MB device.

## Syntax
````
typedef enum _WWAN_SIM_CLASS { 
  WwanSimClassUnknown       = 0,
  WwanSimClassSimLogical,
  WwanSimClassSimRemovable,
  WwanSimClassSimRemote,
  WwanSimClassMax
} WWAN_SIM_CLASS, *PWWAN_SIM_CLASS;
````

## Constants

<table>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>WwanSimClassMax</td>
                    <td>The total number of supported SIM classes.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>WwanSimClassSimLogical</td>
                    <td>The device supports a logical or embedded SIM.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>WwanSimClassSimRemote</td>
                    <td>The device supports a remote SIM that is not physically attached to MB device. For example, a
     tethered cellular telephone modem.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>WwanSimClassSimRemovable</td>
                    <td>The device supports a removable SIM.</td>
