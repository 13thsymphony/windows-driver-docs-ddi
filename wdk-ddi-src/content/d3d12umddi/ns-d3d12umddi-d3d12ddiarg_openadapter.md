# D3D12DDIARG_OPENADAPTER structure
The D3D12DDIARG_OPENADAPTER structure describes the graphics adapter object.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3D12DDIARG_OPENADAPTER {
  D3D12DDI_HRTADAPTER           hRTAdapter;
  D3D12DDI_HADAPTER             hAdapter;
  const D3DDDI_ADAPTERCALLBACKS *pAdapterCallbacks;
  D3D12DDI_ADAPTERFUNCS         *pAdapterFuncs;
} D3D12DDIARG_OPENADAPTER;
````

## Members


`hAdapter`

[out] A handle to the graphics adapter object that specifies the handle that the Direct3D runtime uses in subsequent driver calls to identify the graphics adapter object. The driver generates a unique handle and passes it back to the Direct3D runtime.

`hRTAdapter`

[in] A runtime handle to the graphics adapter object that specifies the handle that the driver should use to query for graphics adapter capabilities when the driver calls the Microsoft Direct3D runtime-supplied <a href="..\d3dumddi\nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_queryadapterinfocb.md">pfnQueryAdapterInfoCb</a> callback function.

`pAdapterCallbacks`

[in] A pointer to a <a href="..\d3dumddi\ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddi_adaptercallbacks.md">D3DDDI_ADAPTERCALLBACKS</a> structure that contains the Direct3D runtime-supplied <b>pfnQueryAdapterInfoCb</b> callback function that the driver can use.

`pAdapterFuncs`

[out] A pointer to a D3D12DDI_ADAPTERFUNCS structure that contains a table of user-mode display driver adapter-specific functions. The Direct3D runtime uses these functions to communicate with the user-mode display driver about operations that are specific to the graphics adapter.
