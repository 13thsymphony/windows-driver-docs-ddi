# ClosePort function
A language or port monitor's <b>ClosePort</b> function closes a printer port.

## Syntax

````
BOOL ClosePort(
  _In_ HANDLE hPort
);
````

## Parameters

`hPort`

Caller-supplied pointer to a port handle.


## Return Value

If the operation succeeds, the function should return <b>TRUE</b>. Otherwise it should return <b>FALSE</b>.

## Remarks

<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/26ba1c22-390a-4187-b67a-3f3497964f8e">Language monitors</a> and port monitor server DLLs are required to define a <b>ClosePort</b> function and include the function's address in a <a href="..\winsplp\ns-winsplp-_monitor2.md">MONITOR2</a> structure.

The handle received as the function's <i>hPort</i> argument is the port handle that the monitor's <a href="..\winsplp\nf-winsplp-openport.md">OpenPort</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559596">OpenPortEx</a> function supplied.

The <b>ClosePort</b> function should close the port by making the received port handle invalid. It should also free all system resources that were allocated by the monitor's <a href="..\winsplp\nf-winsplp-openport.md">OpenPort</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559596">OpenPortEx</a> function.
