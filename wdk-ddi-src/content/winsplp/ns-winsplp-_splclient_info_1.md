# _SPLCLIENT_INFO_1 structure
The SPLCLIENT_INFO_1 structure is used as input to the <a href="..\winsplp\nf-winsplp-generatecopyfilepaths.md">GenerateCopyFilePaths</a> function that is exported by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7ead940e-8426-4756-890f-f3607dc1f9ca">Point and Print DLLs</a>.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _SPLCLIENT_INFO_1 {
  DWORD  dwSize;
  LPWSTR pMachineName;
  LPWSTR pUserName;
  DWORD  dwBuildNum;
  DWORD  dwMajorVersion;
  DWORD  dwMinorVersion;
  WORD   wProcessorArchitecture;
} SPLCLIENT_INFO_1, *PSPLCLIENT_INFO_1, *LPSPLCLIENT_INFO_1;
````
