# SplIsSessionZero function
The <code>SplIsSessionZero</code> function determines whether a certain print job (print handle plus job ID) was issued in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5f6fec1a-1134-4765-81be-9b50939e5e66">session zero</a>.

## Syntax

````
DWORD SplIsSessionZero(
  _In_  HANDLE hPrinter,
  _In_  DWORD  JobID,
  _Out_ BOOL   *pIsSessionZero
);
````

## Parameters

`hPrinter`

Is a handle to the printer.

`JobId`

TBD

`pIsSessionZero`

Pointer to a memory location that is set to <b>TRUE</b> if the SessionID for the session is zero; otherwise, this value is set to <b>FALSE</b>.


## Return Value

On success, the <code>SplIsSessionZero</code> function returns ERROR_SUCCESS; otherwise this function returns a Win32 error code.

## Remarks

A driver that displays custom user interface elements can use the <code>SplIsSessionZero</code> function to determine whether the current job was issued in session 0. Such a driver can use this information to enable it to present user interface elements in the user's session, rather than in session zero. A related function, <a href="..\winsplp\nf-winsplp-splpromptuiinuserssession.md">SplPromptUIInUsersSession</a>, displays a standard Windows message box in the user's session. 

If you plan to use this function in a driver intended to run under Windows 2000, you must load spoolss.dll by a call to the <b>LoadLibrary</b> function, and then find the address of this function within that DLL by a call to the <b>GetProcAddress</b> function. (<b>LoadLibrary</b> and <b>GetProcAddress</b> are described in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.) If the call to <b>GetProcAddress</b> fails, you must use an alternative mechanism to display user interface elements.
