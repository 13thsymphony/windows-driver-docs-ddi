# ClosePrintProcessor function
A print processor's <b>ClosePrintProcessor</b> function completes the printing of a print job and makes the associated handle invalid.

## Syntax

````
BOOL ClosePrintProcessor(
  _Inout_ HANDLE hPrintProcessor
);
````

## Parameters

`hPrintProcessor`

Caller-supplied print processor handle. This is the handle returned by a previous call to <a href="..\winsplp\nf-winsplp-openprintprocessor.md">OpenPrintProcessor</a>.


## Return Value

If the operation succeeds, the function should return <b>TRUE</b>. If the operation fails, the function should call SetLastError to set an error code, and then return <b>FALSE</b>.

## Remarks

Print processors are required to export a <b>ClosePrintProcessor</b> function. The spooler calls the function after the print processor's <a href="..\winsplp\nf-winsplp-printdocumentonprintprocessor.md">PrintDocumentOnPrintProcessor</a> returns. The function should free all resources that were allocated by the <a href="..\winsplp\nf-winsplp-openprintprocessor.md">OpenPrintProcessor</a> function.
