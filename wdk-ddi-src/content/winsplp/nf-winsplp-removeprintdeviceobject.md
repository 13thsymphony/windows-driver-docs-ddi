# RemovePrintDeviceObject function



## -description

## -syntax

````
HRESULT WINAPI RemovePrintDeviceObject(
  _In_ HANDLE hDeviceObject
);
````


## -parameters

### -param hDeviceObject [in]

The HANDLE to the device object to be removed. This should be a device object that was  created with <a href="print.addprintdeviceobject">AddPrintDeviceObject</a>.


## -returns
The <b>RemovePrintDeviceObject</b> function returns S_OK, if the device object was removed successfully. Otherwise it returns an error. 

For example, this function can return HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE), if an invalid device object handle was used to call the function. And note that, regardless of the return value, the device object HANDLE becomes invalid after a call to <b>RemovePrintDeviceObject</b> has completed.


## -remarks
Call <b>RemovePrintDeviceObject</b> to remove the device object for a printer that has been deleted. When the spooler services stops, all the device objects are automatically deleted, so it is not required to call <b>RemovePrintDeviceObject</b> for each printer device object.
