# IOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_LAYOUT IOCTL



## -description

Returns information about the number of partitions, disk signature, and features of each partition on a disk. (Floppy drivers need not handle this request.)



Returns information about the number of partitions, disk signature, and features of each partition on a disk. (Floppy drivers need not handle this request.)



## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
None.


### -input-buffer-length
None.


### -output-buffer
The driver returns the <a href="storage.drive_layout_information">DRIVE_LAYOUT_INFORMATION</a> data in the buffer at <b>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b>.


### -output-buffer-length
<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.OutputBufferLength</b> in the I/O stack location of the IRP indicates the size, in bytes, of the buffer, which must be &gt;= <b>sizeof</b>(DRIVE_LAYOUT_INFORMATION). Note that this structure contains a variable-sized array of <a href="storage.partition_information">PARTITION_INFORMATION</a> elements.


### -in-out-buffer

<text></text>

### -inout-buffer-length

<text></text>

### -status-block
I/O Status block
The <b>Information</b> field is set to the size, in bytes, of the returned data. The <b>Status</b> field can be set to STATUS_SUCCESS, or possibly to STATUS_DEVICE_OFF_LINE, STATUS_INFO_LENGTH_MISMATCH, STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES, or STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL.
