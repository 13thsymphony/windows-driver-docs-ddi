# _PARTITION_INFORMATION_EX structure
PARTITION_INFORMATION_EX is the extended version of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563751">PARTITION_INFORMATION</a> structure. It holds information both for partitions with a Master Boot Record and for partitions with a GUID Partition Table.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct _PARTITION_INFORMATION_EX {
  __WRAPPED__ PARTITION_STYLE PartitionStyle;
  __WRAPPED__ LARGE_INTEGER   StartingOffset;
  __WRAPPED__ LARGE_INTEGER   PartitionLength;
  __WRAPPED__ ULONG           PartitionNumber;
  __WRAPPED__ BOOLEAN         RewritePartition;
  union {
    __WRAPPED__ PARTITION_INFORMATION_GPT Gpt;
    __WRAPPED__ PARTITION_INFORMATION_MBR Mbr;
  } DUMMYUNIONNAME;
} PARTITION_INFORMATION_EX, *PPARTITION_INFORMATION_EX;
```

## Members


`PartitionStyle`

Takes a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563773">PARTITION_STYLE</a> enumerated value that specifies the type of partition table that contains the partition.

`StartingOffset`

Specifies the offset in bytes on drive where the partition begins.

`PartitionLength`

Specifies the length in bytes of the partition.

`PartitionNumber`

Specifies the number of the partition.

`RewritePartition`

Indicates, when <b>TRUE</b>, that the partition information has changed. When <b>FALSE</b>, the information has not changed. This member has a value of <b>TRUE</b> when the partition has changed as a result of an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560408">IOCTL_DISK_SET_DRIVE_LAYOUT</a> IOCTL. This informs the system that the partition information needs to be rewritten.

`DUMMYUNIONNAME`



## Remarks
This is the extended version of the partition information structure, PARTITION_INFORMATION. <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561454">IoReadPartitionTableEx</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561470">IoWritePartitionTableEx</a> operate on an array of PARTITON_INFORMATION_EX structures contained within the extended drive layout structure, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552662">DRIVE_LAYOUT_INFORMATION_EX</a>. PARTITION_INFORMATION_EX replaces the structure PARTITION_INFORMATION that was used with <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561452">IoReadPartitionTable</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561464">IoWritePartitionTable</a>. The principal difference is that the new structures and routines support both Master Boot Record (MBR) partitions and GUID Partition Table (GPT) partitions, whereas the older routines and structures are only used with MBR partitions.
