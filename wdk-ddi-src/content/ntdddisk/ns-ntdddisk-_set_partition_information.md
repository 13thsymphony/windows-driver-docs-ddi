# _SET_PARTITION_INFORMATION structure
SET_PARTITION_INFORMATION is used with IOCTL_DISK_SET_PARTITION_INFO to change the partition type of a specified Master Boot Record (MBR) disk partition.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _SET_PARTITION_INFORMATION {
  UCHAR PartitionType;
} SET_PARTITION_INFORMATION, *PSET_PARTITION_INFORMATION;
````

## Members


`PartitionType`

Indicates the partition type. IOCTL_DISK_SET_PARTITION_INFO uses this value to set the partition type. See <a href="..\ntdddisk\ns-ntdddisk-_partition_information.md">PARTITION_INFORMATION</a> for a list of system-defined GPT partition types.

## Remarks
The single byte unsigned value, <i>PartitionType</i>, contained in this structure defines a traditional AT Master Boot Record style of partition and cannot be used to define an Extensible Firmware Interface partition (also known as a GUID Partition Table partition). GPT partitions use a GUID to indicate the partition type.
