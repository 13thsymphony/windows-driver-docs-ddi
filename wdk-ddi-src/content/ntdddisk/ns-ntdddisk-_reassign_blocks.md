# _REASSIGN_BLOCKS structure
The <b>REASSIGN_BLOCKS</b> structure is used in conjunction with the <a href="..\ntdddisk\ni-ntdddisk-ioctl_disk_reassign_blocks.md">IOCTL_DISK_REASSIGN_BLOCKS</a> request to instruct a disk device to reassign the block numbers of the indicated bad blocks to good blocks.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _REASSIGN_BLOCKS {
  USHORT Reserved;
  USHORT Count;
  ULONG Â BlockNumber[1];
} REASSIGN_BLOCKS, *PREASSIGN_BLOCKS;
````

## Members


`Reserved`

Reserved for system use.

`Count`

Contains the number of blocks in the array pointed to by <b>BlockNumber</b> to reassign.

`BlockNumber`

Contains an array of block numbers corresponding to damaged blocks. These numbers will be reassigned to good blocks taken from the device's spare block pool.
