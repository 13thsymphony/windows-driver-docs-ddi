## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
The buffer at <b>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> contains the <a href="..\ntdddisk\ns-ntdddisk-_reassign_blocks.md">REASSIGN_BLOCKS</a> values to be set. Note that this structure contains a variable-sized array of block numbers. It is the caller's responsibility to make sure that the array of block numbers is sorted in ascending order.


### -input-buffer-length
<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> in the I/O stack location of the IRP indicates the size, in bytes, of the buffer, which must be &gt;= <b>sizeof</b>(REASSIGN_BLOCKS). 


### -output-buffer
None.


### -output-buffer-length
None.


### -in-out-buffer
