# _SENDCMDOUTPARAMS structure
The SENDCMDOUTPARAMS structure is used in conjunction with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566206">SMART_SEND_DRIVE_COMMAND</a> request to retrieve data returned by a Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) command.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct _SENDCMDOUTPARAMS {
  ULONG        cBufferSize;
  DRIVERSTATUS DriverStatus;
  UCHAR        bBuffer[1];
} SENDCMDOUTPARAMS, *LPSENDCMDOUTPARAMS, *PSENDCMDOUTPARAMS;
```

## Members


`cBufferSize`

Contains the size in bytes of the buffer pointed to by <b>bBuffer</b>.

`DriverStatus`

Contains a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552658">DRIVERSTATUS</a> structure that indicates the driver status.

`bBuffer`

Pointer to a buffer in which to store the data read from the drive.

## Remarks
The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566206">SMART_SEND_DRIVE_COMMAND</a> is used to send SMART commands to a device. 

The SENDCMDOUTPARAMS structure is also used with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566204">SMART_RCV_DRIVE_DATA</a> request.
