# _SENDCMDINPARAMS structure
The SENDCMDINPARAMS structure contains the input parameters for the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566206">SMART_SEND_DRIVE_COMMAND</a> request.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _SENDCMDINPARAMS {
  ULONG   cBufferSize;
  IDEREGS irDriveRegs;
  UCHAR   bDriveNumber;
  UCHAR   bReserved[3];
  ULONG   dwReserved[4];
  UCHAR   bBuffer[1];
} SENDCMDINPARAMS, *PSENDCMDINPARAMS, *LPSENDCMDINPARAMS;
````

## Members


`bBuffer`

Pointer to the input buffer.

`bDriveNumber`

The <b>bDriveNumber</b> member is opaque. Do not use it. The operating system ignores this member, because the physical drive that receives the request depends on the handle that the caller uses when making the request.

`bReserved`

Reserved.

`cBufferSize`

Contains the buffer size, in bytes.

`dwReserved`

Reserved.

`irDriveRegs`

Contains a <a href="..\ntdddisk\ns-ntdddisk-_ideregs.md">IDEREGS</a> structure used to report the contents of the IDE controller registers.

## Remarks
The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566206">SMART_SEND_DRIVE_COMMAND</a> is used to send a Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) commands to a device. 

The SENDCMDINPARAMS structure is also used with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566204">SMART_RCV_DRIVE_DATA</a> request.
