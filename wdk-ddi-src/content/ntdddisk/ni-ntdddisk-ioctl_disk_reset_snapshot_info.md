## -description

Clears all volume shadow copy service (VSS) hardware-based snapshot information from the disk. A snapshot is also known as a shadow copy. This request is available in Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating systems. The caller must be running at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL.

## -remarks
This I/O control code can be issued from either a kernel-mode driver or a user-mode application. When this I/O control code is issued from a kernel-mode driver, the caller provides an I/O Request Packet (IRP) that contains an IO_STATUS_BLOCK data structure. This data structure is used to return error information to the caller. When this I/O control code is issued from a user-mode application with the <b>DeviceIocontrol</b> routine, the caller can obtain error information by calling the <b>GetLastError</b> routine.

The disk whose handle is used when this IOCTL is issued might be in the offline state when the IOCTL is issued. If the disk is put in the offline state by using the disk manager Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in, the disk will have its read-only attribute set, which will cause this IOCTL to fail. However, if the disk partition utility (Diskpart.exe) is used to put the disk in the offline state, the read-only attribute for the disk is not set. For this reason, it is best to use the disk partition utility to put a disk in the offline state.
