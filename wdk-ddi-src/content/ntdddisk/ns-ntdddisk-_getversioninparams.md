# _GETVERSIONINPARAMS structure
The GETVERSIONINPARAMS structure is used in conjunction with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566202">SMART_GET_VERSION</a> request to retrieve version information, a capabilities mask, and a bitmask for the indicated device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _GETVERSIONINPARAMS {
  UCHAR bVersion;
  UCHAR bRevision;
  UCHAR bReserved;
  UCHAR bIDEDeviceMap;
  ULONG fCapabilities;
  ULONG dwReserved[4];
} GETVERSIONINPARAMS, *PGETVERSIONINPARAMS, *LPGETVERSIONINPARAMS;
````

## Members


`bIDEDeviceMap`

Contains the bitmap. The following table explains the meaning of the bitmap:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Bitmap Flags</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Bit 0 is set to 1.

</td>
<td>
The device is either a SATA drive or an IDE drive. If it is an IDE drive, it is the master device on the primary channel. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Bit 1 is set to 1.

</td>
<td>
The device is an IDE drive, and it is the subordinate device on the primary channel. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Bit 2 is set to 1.

</td>
<td>
The device is an IDE drive, and it is the master device on the secondary channel. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Bit 3 is set to 1.

</td>
<td>
The device is an IDE drive, and it is the subordinate device on the secondary channel. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Bit 4 is set to 1.

</td>
<td>
The device is an ATAPI drive, and it is the master device on the primary channel. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Bit 5 is set to 1.

</td>
<td>
The device is an ATAPI drive, and it is the subordinate device on the primary channel. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Bit 6 is set to 1.

</td>
<td>
The device is an ATAPI drive, and it is the master device on the secondary channel. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Bit 7 is set to 1.

</td>
<td>
The device is an ATAPI drive, and it is the subordinate device on the secondary channel. 

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`bReserved`

Reserved.

`bRevision`

Contains an integer that indicates the revision number of the binary driver.

`bVersion`

Contains an integer that indicates the version number of the binary driver.

`dwReserved`

Reserved.

`fCapabilities`

Contains the bitmask of driver capabilities. 

<table>
<tr>
<th>Bitmask Flags</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
CAP_ATA_ID_CMD

</td>
<td>
The device supports the ATA ID command. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
CAP_ATAPI_ID_CMD

</td>
<td>
The device supports the ATAPI ID command. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>

CAP_SMART_CMD

</td>
<td>
The device supports SMART commands.

</td>
</tr>
