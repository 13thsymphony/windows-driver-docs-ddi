# _DISK_CACHE_INFORMATION structure



## -description
The DISK_CACHE_INFORMATION structure is used with the <a href="..\ntdddisk\ni-ntdddisk-ioctl_disk_get_cache_information.md">IOCTL_DISK_GET_CACHE_INFORMATION</a> request to retrieve cache information.

## -struct-fields

### -field ParametersSavable

Indicates, when set to 1, that the device is capable of saving any parameters in nonvolatile storage.

### -field ReadCacheEnabled

Indicates, when set to 1, that the read cache is enabled.

### -field WriteCacheEnabled

Indicates, when set to 1, that the write cache is enabled.

### -field ReadRetentionPriority

Determines the likelihood of various types of data remaining in the cache. By means of this value, for instance, data cached from a READ or WRITE operation might be given a different priority than data cached under other circumstances, such as prefetch operations. Thus a value of <b>EqualPriority</b> indicates that no data is held in the cache on a preferential basis. When <b>ReadRetentionPriority</b> is set to <b>EqualPriority</b>, all types of data have equal access to cache memory. On the other hand, a value of <b>KeepPrefetchedData</b> indicates that a preference is to be given to prefetched data while a value of <b>KeepReadData</b> indicates that a preference is to be given to data cached from a READ operation. For more information about the values that can be assigned to this member see the <a href="..\ntdddisk\ne-ntdddisk-disk_cache_retention_priority.md">DISK_CACHE_RETENTION_PRIORITY</a> enumeration. 

### -field WriteRetentionPriority

See discussion under <b>ReadRetentionPriority</b>.

### -field DisablePrefetchTransferLength

Disables prefetching. Prefetching might be disabled whenever the number of blocks requested exceeds the value in <b>DisablePrefetchTransferLength</b>. When zero, prefetching is disabled no matter what the size of the block request.

### -field PrefetchScalar

When <b>TRUE</b>, Indicates that <b>ScalarPrefetch.Maximum</b> should be used together with the transfer length to calculate the amount of data that can be prefetched. When <b>FALSE</b>, <b>BlockPrefetch.Maximum</b> will be the maximum number of disk blocks that can be prefetched.

### -field ScalarPrefetch


### -field Minimum

Contains the scalar multiplier of the transfer length of the request when <b>PrefetchScalar</b> is <b>TRUE</b>. If <b>PrefetchScalar</b> is <b>TRUE</b>, the value in <b>ScalarPrefetch.Minimum</b> is multiplied by the transfer length to obtain the minimum amount of data that can be prefetched into the cache on a disk operation. 

### -field Maximum

Contains the scalar multiplier of the transfer length of the request when <b>PrefetchScalar</b> is <b>TRUE</b>. If <b>PrefetchScalar</b> is <b>TRUE</b>, the value in <b>ScalarPrefetch.Maximum</b> is multiplied by the transfer length to obtain the maximum amount of data that can be prefetched into the cache on a disk operation. 

### -field MaximumBlocks

Contains the maximum size, in blocks, of the transfer length. 
</dd>
</dl>

### -field BlockPrefetch


### -field Minimum

Contains the scalar multiplier of the transfer length of the request when <b>PrefetchScalar</b> is <b>TRUE</b>. If <b>PrefetchScalar</b> is <b>TRUE</b>, the value in <b>ScalarPrefetch.Minimum</b> is multiplied by the transfer length to obtain the minimum amount of data that can be prefetched into the cache on a disk operation. 

### -field Maximum

Contains the scalar multiplier of the transfer length of the request when <b>PrefetchScalar</b> is <b>TRUE</b>. If <b>PrefetchScalar</b> is <b>TRUE</b>, the value in <b>ScalarPrefetch.Maximum</b> is multiplied by the transfer length to obtain the maximum amount of data that can be prefetched into the cache on a disk operation.
