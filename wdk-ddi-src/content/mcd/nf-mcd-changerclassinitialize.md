# ChangerClassInitialize function
The <b>ChangerClassInitialize</b> routine initializes the driver.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS ChangerClassInitialize(
  _In_ PDRIVER_OBJECT  DriverObject,
  _In_ PUNICODE_STRING RegistryPath,
  _In_ PMCD_INIT_DATA  MCDInitData
);
````

## Parameters

`DriverObject`

Pointer to the changer miniclass driver object.  This is passed as a parameter to the miniclass driver's <b>DriverEntry</b> routine. The format of this object is operating system-specific and should not be interpreted by the miniclass driver.

`RegistryPath`

Pointer to the registry path for changer miniclass driver. This is also passed as a parameter to the miniclass driver's <b>DriverEntry</b> routine. The format of this is operating system-specific and should not be interpreted by the miniclass driver.

`ChangerInitData`

TBD


## Return Value

<b>ChangerClassInitialize</b> returns a value indicating the success or failure of  the driver initialization. If initialization is successful, <b>ChangerClassInitialize</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS. Otherwise, <b>ChangerClassInitialize</b> returns an appropriate error message. Minidrivers should <i>not</i> interpret this error value, but should just return this value from their <b>DriverEntry</b> routine.

## Remarks

<b>ChangerClassInitialize</b> is a changer class driver routine that miniclass drivers can call in Microsoft Windows XP and later operating systems.

Changer miniclass drivers call <b>ChangerClassInitialize</b> from within their <b>DriverEntry</b> routines to initialize the driver. <b>ChangerClassInitialize</b> performs many tasks formerly performed by the changer class driver's <b>DriverEntry</b> routine such as registering the miniclass driver's dispatch routines. It allocates a driver object extension and copies the data contained in <i>MCDInitData</i> into the driver object extension along with other initialization data such as the driver's registry path and pointers to certain changer class driver routines that are operating system-specific. 

Changer miniclass drivers must allocate an <a href="..\mcd\ns-mcd-_mcd_init_data.md">MCD_INIT_DATA</a> structure, zero the structure by calling <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-rtlzeromemory.md">RtlZeroMemory</a>, and then assign values to the appropriate members, before passing the structure's address to <b>ChangerClassInitialize</b> by means of the <i>MCDInitData</i> parameter.
