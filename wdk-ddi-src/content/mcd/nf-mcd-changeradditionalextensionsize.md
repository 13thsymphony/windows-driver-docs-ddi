# ChangerAdditionalExtensionSize function



## -description
<b>ChangerAdditionalExtensionSize</b> indicates the number of bytes the changer miniclass driver requires to store device-specific information in the device extension.



## -syntax

````
ULONG ChangerAdditionalExtensionSize(void);
````


## -parameters


## -returns
<b>ChangerAdditionalExtensionSize</b> returns the size, in bytes, of the additional device extension space required by the changer miniclass driver. 

<b>ChangerAdditionalExtensionSize</b> returns the size, in bytes, of the additional device extension space required by the changer miniclass driver. 

<b>ChangerAdditionalExtensionSize</b> returns the size, in bytes, of the additional device extension space required by the changer miniclass driver. 


## -remarks
The changer class driver calls <b>ChangerAdditionalExtensionSize</b> to determine the number of bytes the miniclass driver requires in the device extension for a particular changer before creating the device object to represent that changer.

The device-specific information stored by a changer miniclass driver is determined by the driver. It typically includes zero-based offsets that other miniclass driver routines can use to translate between device-specific element addresses and the zero-based element addresses used by the system. It can also include SCSI inquiry data or the non-SCSI equivalent.
