# DriverEntry function
The <b><i>DriverEntry</i></b> miniport driver routine is called when the miniport driver is loaded.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The ATA port driver and ATA miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS DriverEntry(
  _In_ struct _DRIVER_OBJECT *DriverObject,
  _In_ PUNICODE_STRING       RegistryPath
);
````

## Parameters

`DriverObject`

A pointer to an opaque structure to be used as the first parameter when this routine calls the <a href="..\irb\nf-irb-ataportinitializeex.md">AtaPortInitializeEx</a> routine.

`RegistryPath`

A pointer to an opaque structure to be used as the second parameter when this routine calls the <a href="..\irb\nf-irb-ataportinitializeex.md">AtaPortInitializeEx</a> routine.


## Return Value

The return values for this routine are recommended to mirror the return values of <a href="..\irb\nf-irb-ataportinitializeex.md">AtaPortInitializeEx</a>.

## Remarks

<b>DriverEntry</b> is the first function that is called in an ATA miniport driver. The ATA miniport driver must allocate an <a href="..\irb\ns-irb-_ide_controller_interface.md">IDE_CONTROLLER_INTERFACE</a> structure, initialize it, and send it to <a href="..\irb\nf-irb-ataportinitializeex.md">AtaPortInitializeEx</a>. The ATA miniport driver indicates its support for the channel interface by setting the ChannelExtensionSize and the <b><i>AtaChannelInitRoutine</i></b> entry point in the <b>IDE_CONTROLLER_INTERFACE</b> structure. This causes the ATA port driver to call the function that is specified in the <b><i>AtaChannelInitRoutine</i></b> field that has a ChannelExtension of size ChannelExtensionSize. The function is called one time for every NumberOfChannels specified in the ControllerConfiguration structure that are returned by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550140">AtaAdapterControl</a> when <b>AtaAdapterControl</b> handles an IdeStart action.
