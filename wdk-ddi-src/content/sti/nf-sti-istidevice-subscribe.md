# Subscribe method
The<b> IStiDevice::Subscribe</b> method registers the caller to receive notifications of device events.

## Syntax

````
HRESULT Subscribe(
  [in, out] LPSTISUBSCRIBE lpSubscribe
);
````

## Parameters

`lpSubsribe`




## Return Value

If the operation succeeds, the method returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns one of the STIERR-prefixed error codes defined in <i>stierr.h</i>.

## Remarks

The<b> IStiDevice::Subscribe</b> method is typically called by applications that intercept events from devices and reroute them. The method allows these applications to be notified of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/5f9be89c-8442-4894-b2f6-a4d3558464bf">Still Image Device Events</a> so they can then dispatch control to appropriate display applications.

Based on contents supplied in the <a href="..\sti\ns-sti-_stisubscribe.md">STISUBSCRIBE</a> structure, the caller can request to be notified of device events by Windows messages or by Win32 events (by means of <b>SetEvent</b> calls).

When the application receives notification of an event, it can call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543751">IStiDevice::GetLastNotificationData</a> to find out which event occurred. 

Before calling <b>IStiDevice::Subscribe</b>, clients of the <b>IStiDevice</b> COM interface must call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543778">IStillImage::CreateDevice</a> to obtain an <b>IStiDevice</b> interface pointer, which provides access to a specified device.
