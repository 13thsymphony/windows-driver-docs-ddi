# _STI_DEV_CAPS structure



## -description
The STI_DEV_CAPS structure is used as a parameter to the <a href="image.istidevice_getcapabilities">IStiDevice::GetCapabilities</a> method. It is also a member of the <a href="image.sti_device_information">STI_DEVICE_INFORMATION</a> and <a href="image.sti_wia_device_information">STI_WIA_DEVICE_INFORMATION</a> structures.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _STI_DEV_CAPS {
  DWORD dwGeneric;
} STI_DEV_CAPS, *PSTI_DEV_CAPS;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field dwGeneric

Contains bit flags identifying device capabilities. The following flags are defined.




### -field STI_GENCAP_AUTO_PORTSELECT

The driver is capable of determining which LPT or COM port the device is connected to. If this flag is set, the user can select "Auto" for the port during device installations, and the driver must determine the port.

</dd>
</dl>



### -field STI_GENCAP_GENERATE_ARRIVALEVENT

The still image server will generate a <b>GUID_DeviceArrivedLaunch</b> event when the device is successfully initialized, typically in response to PnP arrival. (Events are not generated by the servers initial enumeration, to avoid end-user confusion.)

</dd>
</dl>



### -field STI_GENCAP_NOTIFICATIONS

The device supports event notifications (either asynchronously or through polling), and the device can be subscribed to (see <a href="image.istidevice_subscribe">IStiDevice::Subscribe</a>).

</dd>
</dl>



### -field STI_GENCAP_POLLING_NEEDED

The device is not capable of issuing asynchronous notifications; polling of the device is required (see <a href="image.istidevice_getstatus">IStiDevice::GetStatus</a>).

</dd>
</dl>



### -field STI_GENCAP_SUBSET

A driver with more features exists. An IHV driver with a full set of features should not have this bit set.

</dd>
</dl>



### -field STI_GENCAP_WIA

The user-mode still image driver is WIA-capable.

</dd>
</dl>
The values assigned to these flags are based on registry contents that the <b>Capabilities</b> entry for the device's setup information (INF) file supplies. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f68ba904-9049-4f7e-9903-fdf6f413a1a5">INF Files for Still Image Devices</a>.
