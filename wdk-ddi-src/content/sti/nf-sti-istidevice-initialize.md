# IStiDevice::Initialize method
The <b>IStiDevice::Initialize</b> method initializes an instance of the COM object that defines the <b>IStiDevice</b> interface. <i>This method is for internal use only</i>.

## Syntax

```
HRESULT Initialize(
  HINSTANCE hinst,
  LPCWSTR   pwszDeviceName,
  DWORD     dwVersion,
  DWORD     dwMode
);
```

## Parameters

`hinst`

Caller-supplied instance handle of the calling process. This handle is obtained by calling <b>GetModuleName</b>(NULL).

`pwszDeviceName`

Caller-supplied pointer to a string representing an internal device name, obtained by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543790">IStillImage::GetSTILaunchInformation</a>.

`dwVersion`

Caller-supplied STI version number. This value must be STI_VERSION, defined in <i>Sti.h</i>.

`dwMode`

Caller-supplied constant value indicating the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/79af0d8f-dd04-4ff4-a047-f415562a16a5">Transfer Modes</a> in which the device is to be used. The following values are valid.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Mode</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STI_DEVICE_CREATE_BOTH

</td>
<td>
The device is being opened for both obtaining status and transferring data.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STI_DEVICE_CREATE_DATA

</td>
<td>
The device is being opened only for data transfers.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STI_DEVICE_CREATE_STATUS

</td>
<td>
The device is being opened only for obtaining status information.

</td>
</tr>
</table>


## Return Value

If the operation succeeds, the method returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns one of the STIERR-prefixed error codes defined in <i>stierr.h</i>.

## Remarks

The <b>IStiDevice::Initialize</b> method initializes the COM object instance that was created by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543778">IStillImage::CreateDevice</a>.

Because <b>IStiDevice::Initialize</b> is called by <b>IStillImage::CreateDevice</b>, clients of the <b>IStiDevice</b> interface do not typically call this method directly.
