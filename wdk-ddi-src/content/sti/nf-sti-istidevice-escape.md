# IStiDevice::Escape method
The <b>IStiDevice::Escape</b> method sends a request for a vendor-specific I/O operation to a still image device.

## Syntax

```
HRESULT Escape(
  STI_RAW_CONTROL_CODE EscapeFunction,
  LPVOID               lpInData,
  DWORD                cbInDataSize,
  LPVOID               pOutData,
  DWORD                dwOutDataSize,
  LPDWORD              pdwActualData
);
```

## Parameters

`EscapeFunction`

Caller-supplied, vendor-defined, DWORD-sized value representing an I/O operation. The device's minidriver must recognize this value and must export an <b>IStiUSD</b> interface. Vendor-defined values must be greater than STI_RAW_RESERVED, which is defined in <i>Sti.h</i>.

`lpInData`

Caller-supplied pointer to a buffer containing data to be sent to the device.

`cbInDataSize`

Caller-supplied length, in bytes, of the data contained in the buffer pointed to by <i>lpInData</i>.

`pOutData`

Caller-supplied pointer to a memory buffer to receive data from the device.

`dwOutDataSize`

Caller-supplied length, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by <i>lpOutData</i>.

`pdwActualData`

Receives the number of bytes actually written to <i>pOutData</i>.


## Return Value

If the operation succeeds, the method returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns one of the STIERR-prefixed error codes defined in <i>stierr.h</i>.

## Remarks

The <b>IStiDevice::Escape</b> method calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543815">IStiUSD::Escape</a>, which is exported by vendor-supplied minidrivers. The device's minidriver defines the Method parameter usage.

Before calling <b>IStiDevice::Escape</b>, clients of the <b>IStiDevice</b> COM interface must call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543778">IStillImage::CreateDevice</a> to obtain an <b>IStiDevice</b> interface pointer, which provides access to a specified device.

A call to <b>IStiDevice::Escape</b> must be preceded by a call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543756">IStiDevice::LockDevice</a> and followed by a call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543770">IStiDevice::UnLockDevice</a>.
