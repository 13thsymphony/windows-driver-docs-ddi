# IStiDevice::RawWriteCommand method
The <b>IStiDevice::RawWriteCommand</b> method sends command information to a still image device.

## Syntax

```
HRESULT RawWriteCommand(
  LPVOID       lpBuffer,
  DWORD        nNumberOfBytes,
  LPOVERLAPPED lpOverlapped
);
```

## Parameters

`lpBuffer`

Caller-supplied pointer to a buffer containing data to be sent to the device.

`nNumberOfBytes`

Caller-supplied number of bytes to be written. This is the number of bytes in the buffer pointed to by <i>lpBuffer</i>.

`lpOverlapped`

Optional, caller-supplied pointer to an OVERLAPPED structure (described in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation).


## Return Value

If the operation succeeds, the method returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns one of the STIERR-prefixed error codes defined in <i>stierr.h</i>.

## Remarks

The <b>IStiDevice::RawWriteCommand</b> method calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543836">IStiUSD::RawWriteCommand</a>, which is exported by vendor-supplied minidrivers. The meaning of buffer contents are vendor-defined.

It is only necessary to call <b>IStiDevice::RawWriteCommand</b> if commands and data are written to a device by different methods. For other devices, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543764">IStiDevice::RawWriteData</a> can be used for both commands and data.

Before calling <b>IStiDevice::RawWriteCommand</b>, clients of the <b>IStiDevice</b> COM interface must call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543778">IStillImage::CreateDevice</a> to obtain an <b>IStiDevice</b> interface pointer, which provides access to a specified device.

A call to <b>IStiDevice::RawWriteCommand</b> must be preceded by a call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543756">IStiDevice::LockDevice</a> and followed by a call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543770">IStiDevice::UnLockDevice</a>.
