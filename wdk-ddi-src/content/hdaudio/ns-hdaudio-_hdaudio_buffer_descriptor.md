# _HDAUDIO_BUFFER_DESCRIPTOR structure
The HDAUDIO_BUFFER_DESCRIPTOR structure specifies a buffer descriptor, which is an entry in a buffer descriptor list (BDL).

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _HDAUDIO_BUFFER_DESCRIPTOR {
  PHYSICAL_ADDRESS Address;
  ULONG            Length;
  ULONG            InterruptOnCompletion;
} HDAUDIO_BUFFER_DESCRIPTOR, *PHDAUDIO_BUFFER_DESCRIPTOR;
````

## Members


`Address`

Specifies the start address of a physically contiguous fragment of the buffer. In the case of a 32-bit address, the address should be right-justified and the 32 most significant bits (MSBs) of the member should be zero.

`InterruptOnCompletion`

Specifies whether the DMA engine should generate an interrupt on completing the transfer of the buffer fragment. A value of 1 enables the interrupt. A value of 0 disables it.

`Length`

Specifies the size in bytes of the buffer fragment.

## Remarks
A BDL is an array of HDAUDIO_BUFFER_DESCRIPTOR structures. Each structure specifies a physically contiguous fragment of the buffer. A BDL specifies all the fragments that make up the buffer.

The <b>Address</b> member contains the physical memory address of the start of the buffer fragment. The <b>Length</b> member specifies the number of bytes of physically contiguous memory that the fragment contains.

If the <b>InterruptOnCompletion</b> bit is set during a DMA transfer to or from the buffer fragment, the DMA engine generates an interrupt on completion of the transfer.

This structure is used by the <a href="..\hdaudio\nc-hdaudio-pallocate_contiguous_dma_buffer.md">AllocateContiguousDmaBuffer</a> and <a href="..\hdaudio\nc-hdaudio-psetup_dma_engine_with_bdl.md">SetupDmaEngineWithBdl</a> routines.

For more information about BDLs, see the Intel High Definition Audio Specification at the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=42508">Intel HD Audio</a> website.
