# IOCTL_MOUNTDEV_LINK_CREATED IOCTL



## -description
<p>Support for this IOCTL by the mount manager clients is optional. The mount manager uses this IOCTL to alert the client driver that a persistent name has been assigned to its volume. The input for this IOCTL is the persistent name assigned. </p>


## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
<p>The mount point manager places a variable-length structure of type <a href="..\mountmgr\ns-mountmgr--mountdev-name.md">MOUNTDEV_NAME</a>, defined in <i>Mountmgr.h</i>, at the beginning of the buffer at <b>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b>. The mount manager inserts the persistent name just assigned at the address pointed to by the <i>Name</i> member of this structure.</p>

### -input-buffer-length
<p><b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> in the I/O stack location of the IRP indicates the size, in bytes, of the input buffer, which must be greater than or equal to <b>sizeof</b>(MOUNTDEV_NAME).</p>
