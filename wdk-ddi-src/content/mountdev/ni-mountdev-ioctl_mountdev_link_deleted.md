# IOCTL_MOUNTDEV_LINK_DELETED IOCTL
Support for this IOCTL by the mount manager clients is optional. It alerts the mount manager client that a persistent name associated with it has been deleted. The input for this IOCTL is the persistent name that was deleted.

### Major Code
[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](xref:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control")

### Input Buffer
The mount point manager places a variable-length structure of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff562256">MOUNTDEV_NAME</a>, defined in <i>Mountmgr.h</i>, at the beginning of the buffer at <b>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b>. The mount manager inserts the persistent name just assigned at the address pointed to by the <i>Name</i> member of this structure.

### Input Buffer Length
<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> in the I/O stack location of the IRP indicates the size, in bytes, of the input buffer, which must be greater than or equal to <b>sizeof</b>(MOUNTDEV_NAME).

### Output Buffer
None

### Output Buffer Length
