# PosCxPutPendingEvent function
PosCxPutPendingEvent creates a new event object, copies the event data to the
      new event object, and tries to delegate it to the waiting caller. 
      If the target caller does not have a read request waiting, the new event is added to 
      the designated event queue (control or data).

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS PosCxPutPendingEvent(
  _In_ WDFDEVICE                                  device,
  _In_ ULONG                                      deviceInterfaceTag,
  _In_ ULONG                                      eventType,
  _In_ size_t                                     rawEventDataSize,
       _In_reads_opt_(rawEventDataSize)
    PVOID rawEventDataPtr,
  _In_ POS_CX_EVENT_ATTRIBUTES                    eventAttr
);
````

## Parameters

`device`

A handle to a framework device object that represents the device.

`deviceInterfaceTag`

The device interface associated with the event.  By default, only
          file objects that have the same tag will receive this event.

`eventType`

The new event type.

`rawEventDataSize`

The raw event (without point-of-service header) buffer size in bytes.

`rawEventDataPtr`

The pointer to the raw (without point-of-service header) event data.
          The caller may reuse/release <i>rawEventDataPtr</i> after <b>PosCxPutPendingEvent</b> returns.

`eventAttr`

The event attributes.


## Return Value

Possible return values are:

<table>
<tr>
<td><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></td>
<td>The event was created and delegated to a waiting caller,
          or the event was discarded because there is no device owner.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>STATUS_PENDING</b></td>
<td>The event was queued because no caller is currently waiting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Other errors</td>
<td>Other appropriate failure error codes.</td>
</tr>
</table>
