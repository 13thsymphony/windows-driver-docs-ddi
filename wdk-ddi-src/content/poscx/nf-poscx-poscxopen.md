# PosCxOpen function
PosCxOpen is called to create an open PosCx library instance. This function initializes all resources it needs to manage a single open instance. It should be called from the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540868">EVT_WDF_DEVICE_FILE_CREATE</a>   callback.

## Syntax

```
NTSTATUS PosCxOpen(
  WDFDEVICE     device,
  WDFFILEOBJECT fileObject,
  ULONG         deviceInterfaceTag
);
```

## Parameters

`device`

A handle to a framework device object that represents the device.

`fileObject`

A handle to a framework file object that identifies the caller associated with the open instance.

`deviceInterfaceTag`

An identifier used to specify the caller's device interface in a multi-function device.  For a single-interface device, this value should be 0.
