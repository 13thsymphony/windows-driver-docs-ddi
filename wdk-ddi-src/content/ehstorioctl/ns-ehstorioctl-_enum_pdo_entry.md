# _ENUM_PDO_ENTRY structure
This structure describes a single entry in a result set of Physical Device Objects (PDOs) that are enumerated with <a href="..\ehstorioctl\ni-ehstorioctl-ioctl_ehstor_device_enumerate_pdos.md">IOCTL_EHSTOR_DEVICE_ENUMERATE_PDOS</a>.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _ENUM_PDO_ENTRY {
  UCHAR type;
  UCHAR state;
  UCHAR capabilities;
  ULONG ulSTID;
  UCHAR bSpecificationMajor;
  UCHAR bSpecificationMinor;
  UCHAR bImplementationMajor;
  UCHAR bImplementationMinor;
  WCHAR wszDeviceInstancePath[(2 * MAX_PATH) + 1];
} ENUM_PDO_ENTRY, *PENUM_PDO_ENTRY;
````

## Members


`bImplementationMajor`



`bImplementationMinor`



`bSpecificationMajor`



`bSpecificationMinor`



`capabilities`

This member contains a bitmask with bits indicating information about the silo represented by the PDO in question, as defined by PDO_CAPS.

`state`

This member contains information about the current PnP state of the PDO, as defined by PDO_STATE.

`type`

This member indicates the type of the PDO that is being identified, as defined by PDO_TYPE.

`ulSTID`

This member contains the silo type identifier, as defined and assigned by the IEEE 1667 working group.

`wszDeviceInstancePath`

The string contained in this member is the device instance path in a form suitable for use with the Win32 API CreateFile routine.
