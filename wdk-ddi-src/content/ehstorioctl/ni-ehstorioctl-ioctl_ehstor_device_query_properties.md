# IOCTL_EHSTOR_DEVICE_QUERY_PROPERTIES IOCTL
A silo driver sends this IOCTL to the storage device stack to query for storage device properties. The   Enhanced Storage Class Driver (EHSTOR) will handle the request and return the available properties.

### Major Code
[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](xref:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control")

### Input Buffer
None.

### Input Buffer Length
None.

### Output Buffer
The output buffer at <b>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> contains an  <b>EHSTOR_DEVICE_PROPERTIES</b>  structure. <b>EHSTOR_DEVICE_PROPERTIES</b> is declared in <i>ehstorioctl.h</i> as the following.



The size of the structure. This is set to <b>sizeof</b>(EHSTOR_DEVICE_PROPERTIES).

The size, in bytes, of a sector on the underlying storage device.

### Output Buffer Length
an  <b>EHSTOR_DEVICE_PROPERTIES</b>  structure.

### Input / Output Buffer
<text></text>

### Input / Output Buffer Length
<text></text>

### Status Block
I/O Status block
STATUS_SUCCESS is returned in the <b>Status</b> field if device properties are returned in the system buffer. Otherwise, another appropriate status code  is returned.

    ## Remarks
        Currently, bytes per sector is the only property available in <b>EHSTOR_DEVICE_PROPERTIES</b>.

## Requirements
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows Driver kit version** |  |
| **Header** | ehstorioctl.h (include EhStorIoctl.h) |
| **IRQL** |  |
