# IOCTL_EHSTOR_DEVICE_SET_QUEUE_STATE IOCTL
The <b>IOCTL_EHSTOR_DEVICE_SET_QUEUE_STATE</b> request is sent by silo drivers and applications to change the state of a storage device queue. IO requests in the storage device queue are held when the device is temporarily unauthorized.

### Major Code
[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](xref:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control")

### Input Buffer
The input buffer at <b>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> contains an <b> ACT_QUEUE_STATE</b>  structure. <b>ACT_QUEUE_STATE</b> is declared in <i>ehstorioctl.h</i> as the following.

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>typedef struct tagACT_QUEUE_STATE
{
    BOOLEAN fFrozen;
} ACT_QUEUE_STATE;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>

### Input Buffer Length
The length of an <b> ACT_QUEUE_STATE</b>  structure.

### Output Buffer
None.

### Output Buffer Length
None.

### Input / Output Buffer
<text></text>

### Input / Output Buffer Length
<text></text>

### Status Block
One of the following values can be returned in the <b>Status</b> field.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Status Value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>STATUS_SUCCESS</td>
<td>The queue state was changed successfully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>STATUS_INVALID_BUFFER_SIZE</td>
<td>The input buffer length is too small.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED</td>
<td>The IOCTL request was not issued by a silo driver.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks
Silo drivers or applications can freeze the storage device IO request queue if temporary unauthorization is needed. Normally, temporary unauthorization occurs during low power states or when a policy requires locking of Enhanced Storage devices such as a locked user session. In such a case, it is preferable to put pending IO requests on hold rather than  fail the IO requests and cause data loss.

To prevent abuse of  the <b>IOCTL_EHSTOR_DEVICE_SET_QUEUE_STATE</b> request by applications, only a driver can issue this IOCTL. If sent from a user mode application, this request will fail with STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED.
