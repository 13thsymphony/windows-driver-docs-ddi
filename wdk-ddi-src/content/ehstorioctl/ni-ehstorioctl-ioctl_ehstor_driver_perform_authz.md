# IOCTL_EHSTOR_DRIVER_PERFORM_AUTHZ IOCTL
<b>IOCTL_EHSTOR_DRIVER_PERFORM_AUTHZ</b> is sent by the Enhanced Storage Class Driver (EHSTOR) to the silo driver to initiate on-demand authentication or deauthentication.

### Major Code
[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](xref:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control")

### Input Buffer
The input buffer at <b>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> must contain an <b>AUTHZ_STATE</b> structure that indicates the type of authentication operation to perform. <b>AUTHZ_STATE</b> is declared in <i>ehstorioctl.h</i> as the following.

The value of <b>AuthzState</b> specifies the authentication operation. This is one of the following.

### Input Buffer Length
The length of an <b>AUTHZ_STATE</b> structure.

### Output Buffer
None.

### Output Buffer Length
None.

### Input / Output Buffer
<text></text>

### Input / Output Buffer Length
<text></text>

### Status Block
I/O Status block
STATUS_SUCCESS is returned in the <b>Status</b> field by the silo driver if the authentication state is changed. Otherwise, STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL is returned.

    ## Remarks
        This IOCTL is sent by EHSTOR to a silo driver that supports on-demand authentication. The silo driver notifies EHSTOR of this capability in a prior <a href="..\ehstorioctl\ni-ehstorioctl-ioctl_ehstor_driver_report_capabilities.md">IOCTL_EHSTOR_DRIVER_REPORT_CAPABILITIES</a> request with the <b>CAP_ON_DEMAND_AUTHENTICATION</b> flag set in the <b>Capabilities</b> member of <a href="..\ehstorioctl\ns-ehstorioctl-tagact_authz_state.md">SILO_DRIVER_CAPABILITES</a>. 

In response to this IOCTL, the silo driver performs authentication or deauthentication for the device. For banded devices, the silo driver will, depending on the specified operation in the system buffer, unlock or lock as many bands as possible for reads and writes.

If the silo driver fails to perform the requested operation, it will not change the authentication state of a device. 

If the <b>AuthzState</b> member of <b>AUTHZ_STATE</b> is set to <b>AUTHZSTATE_CLEAR_AUTHKEY_CACHE</b>, then the silo driver clears its authentication key cache in addition to deauthenticating. <b>AUTHZSTATE_CLEAR_AUTHKEY_CACHE</b> is set when the system is shutting down or hibernating. This prevents the presence of the  key cache in the hibernation file.

If a device supports multiple silos, authentication by each silo is exclusive. An authentication operation by one silo driver does not affect the authentication state set by another silo driver.
