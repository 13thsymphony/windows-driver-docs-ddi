# _LBA_FILTER_TABLE_ENTRY structure
The <b>LBA_FILTER_TABLE_ENTRY</b> structure contains an individual LBA range for the <a href="..\ehstorioctl\ns-ehstorioctl-_lba_filter_table.md">LBA_FILTER_TABLE</a> sent in an <a href="..\ehstorioctl\ni-ehstorioctl-ioctl_ehstor_driver_update_lba_filter_table.md">IOCTL_EHSTOR_DRIVER_UPDATE_LBA_FILTER_TABLE</a> request.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _LBA_FILTER_TABLE_ENTRY {
  ULARGE_INTEGER StartLba;
  ULARGE_INTEGER LbaCount;
  BOOLEAN        ReadLock;
  BOOLEAN        WriteLock;
} LBA_FILTER_TABLE_ENTRY, *PLBA_FILTER_TABLE_ENTRY;
````

## Members


`LbaCount`

The number of LBAs in the LBA range.

`ReadLock`

Set to TRUE if the LBA range in this entry is  not readable. Otherwise, this member is FALSE and the LBA range is readable.

`StartLba`

The starting LBA of the LBA range for this entry.

`WriteLock`

Set to TRUE if the LBA range in this entry is  not writeable. Otherwise, this member is FALSE and the LBA range is writable

## Remarks
An LBA range is valid only if LbaCount is &gt; 0 and it is not overlapping with another entry in <a href="..\ehstorioctl\ns-ehstorioctl-_lba_filter_table.md">LBA_FILTER_TABLE</a>.
