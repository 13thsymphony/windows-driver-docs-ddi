# IOCTL_INTERNAL_I8042_HOOK_KEYBOARD IOCTL
The IOCTL_INTERNAL_I8042_HOOK_KEYBOARD request does the following:

<ul>
<li>
Adds an initialization callback routine to the I8042prt keyboard initialization routine

</li>
<li>
Adds an ISR callback routine to the I8042prt keyboard ISR

</li>
</ul>
The initialization and ISR callbacks are optional and are provided by an upper-level filter driver for a PS/2-style keyboard device.

After I8042prt receives an <a href="..\kbdmou\ni-kbdmou-ioctl_internal_keyboard_connect.md">IOCTL_INTERNAL_KEYBOARD_CONNECT</a> request, it sends a synchronous IOCTL_INTERNAL_I8042_HOOK_KEYBOARD request to the top of the keyboard device stack.

After Kbfiltr receives the hook keyboard request, Kbfiltr filters the request in the following way:

<ul>
<li>
Saves the upper-level information passed to Kbfiltr, which includes the context of an upper-level device object, a pointer to an initialization callback, and a pointer to an ISR callback

</li>
<li>
Replaces the upper-level information with its own

</li>
<li>
Saves the context of I8042prt and pointers to callbacks that the Kbfiltr ISR callback can use

</li>
</ul>
