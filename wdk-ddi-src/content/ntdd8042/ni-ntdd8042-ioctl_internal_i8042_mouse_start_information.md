# IOCTL_INTERNAL_I8042_MOUSE_START_INFORMATION IOCTL
The IOCTL_INTERNAL_I8042_MOUSE_START_INFORMATION request passes a pointer to a mouse interrupt object. I8042prt sends this request synchronously to the top of the device stack after the mouse interrupt object is created. Upper-level filter drivers that need to synchronize their callback operation with the mouse ISR can use the pointer to the mouse interrupt object.

### Major Code
[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](xref:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control")

### Input Buffer
<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.Type3InputBuffer</b> points to an input buffer allocated by I8042prt to input an <a href="..\ntdd8042\ns-ntdd8042-_internal_i8042_start_information.md">INTERNAL_I8042_START_INFORMATION</a> structure.

### Input Buffer Length
<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> specifies the size, in bytes, of an INTERNAL_I8042_START_INFORMATION structure.

### Output Buffer
None

### Output Buffer Length
None

### Input / Output Buffer
