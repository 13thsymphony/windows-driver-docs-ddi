# IOCTL_INTERNAL_I8042_MOUSE_WRITE_BUFFER IOCTL



## -description

The IOCTL_INTERNAL_I8042_MOUSE_WRITE_BUFFER request writes data to the i8042 port controller to control operation of a mouse device. An upper-level filter driver can use this request to control the operation of a mouse.

I8042prt synchronizes write buffer requests with one another. I8042prt synchronizes the actual write of data with the mouse ISR.
