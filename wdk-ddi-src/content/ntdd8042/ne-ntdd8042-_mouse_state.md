</tr>

<tr>
<td>MouseResetting</td>
<td>Indicates that I8042prt is resetting the mouse.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>XMovement</td>
<td>Indicates that the next input byte from a mouse should be a byte that specifies movement data in the x-direction.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>YMovement</td>
<td>Indicates that the next input byte from a mouse should be a byte that specifies movement data in the y-direction.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ZMovement</td>
<td>Indicates that the next input byte from a mouse should be a byte that specifies movement data in the z-direction (generated by a wheel mouse).</td>
