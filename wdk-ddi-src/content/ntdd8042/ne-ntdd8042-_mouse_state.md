# _MOUSE_STATE Enumeration
The MOUSE_STATE enumeration type identifies the current state of input from a mouse.

## Syntax
````
typedef enum _MOUSE_STATE { 
  MouseIdle,
  XMovement,
  YMovement,
  ZMovement,
  MouseExpectingACK,
  MouseResetting
} MOUSE_STATE, *PMOUSE_STATE;
````

## Constants

<table>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>MouseIdle</td>
                    <td>Indicates that the next input byte from a mouse should be a status byte that specifies the button state and the sign and overflow bits for the x and y movement.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>XMovement</td>
                    <td>Indicates that the next input byte from a mouse should be a byte that specifies movement data in the x-direction.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>YMovement</td>
                    <td>Indicates that the next input byte from a mouse should be a byte that specifies movement data in the y-direction.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>ZMovement</td>
                    <td>Indicates that the next input byte from a mouse should be a byte that specifies movement data in the z-direction (generated by a wheel mouse).</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>MouseExpectingACK</td>
                    <td>Indicates that the next input byte from a mouse should be an acknowledgment from an enable mouse command.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>MouseResetting</td>
                    <td>Indicates that I8042prt is resetting the mouse.</td>
                </tr>
</table>

## Remarks

The MOUSE_STATE enumerator is used as input to a <a href="..\ntdd8042\nc-ntdd8042-pi8042_mouse_isr.md">PI8042_MOUSE_ISR</a> callback.
