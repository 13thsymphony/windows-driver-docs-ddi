# PFN_WDFWMIINSTANCEFIREEVENT function



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF only]

The <b>WdfWmiInstanceFireEvent</b> method sends a WMI event to WMI clients that have registered to receive event notification.



## -syntax

````
NTSTATUS WdfWmiInstanceFireEvent(
  _In_     WDFWMIINSTANCE WmiInstance,
  _In_opt_ ULONG          EventDataSize,
  _In_opt_ PVOID          EventData
);
````


## -parameters

### -param WmiInstance [in]

A handle to a WMI instance object that the driver obtained from a previous call to <a href="..\wdfwmi\nf-wdfwmi-wdfwmiinstancecreate.md">WdfWmiInstanceCreate</a>.


### -param EventDataSize [in, optional]

The size, in bytes, of the event data that <i>EventData</i> points to.


### -param EventData [in, optional]

A pointer to the event data, or <b>NULL</b> if there is no event data.


## -returns
<b>WdfWmiInstanceFireEvent</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this method might return one of the following values:
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES</b></dt>
</dl>There was insufficient memory.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL</b></dt>
</dl>The framework's attempt to communicate with WMI failed.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW</b></dt>
</dl>The event data buffer was too large.

 

This method also might return other <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557697">NTSTATUS values</a>.

A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.




## -remarks
Your driver should call <b>WdfWmiInstanceFireEvent</b> only if a WMI client has registered for event notification. The driver can determine if it should call <b>WdfWmiInstanceFireEvent</b> by providing an <a href="..\wdfwmi\nc-wdfwmi-evt_wdf_wmi_provider_function_control.md">EvtWmiProviderFunctionControl</a> callback function or calling <a href="..\wdfwmi\nf-wdfwmi-wdfwmiproviderisenabled.md">WdfWmiProviderIsEnabled</a>.

The driver should place its event-specific data, if any, in the buffer that the <i>EventData</i> parameter points to. The framework adds all of the necessary WMI header information.

For more information about the <b>WdfWmiInstanceFireEvent</b> method, see <a href="wdf.supporting_wmi_in_kmdf_drivers">Supporting WMI in Framework-Based Drivers</a>.

The following code example sends a WMI event to WMI clients.
