# EVT_SENSOR_DRIVER_ENABLE_WAKE function



## -description
Callback to enable wake for the sensor. 



## -syntax

````
NTSTATUS CALLBACK EVT_SENSOR_DRIVER_ENABLE_WAKE(
  _In_ SENSOROBJECT Sensor
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Sensor [in]

A reference to the sensor object


## -returns
This function returns STATUS_SUCCESS when completed successfully.


## -remarks
This DDSI function does not compulsorily have to be implemented by the driver because it is expected that some sensor drivers do not care about enabling wake on the sensor. If it not implemented the enable call is ignored and a STATUS_SUCCESS is returned. This is primarily because PKEY_Sensor_WakeCapable is implemented today and used by some sensors such as the accelerometer and the proximity sensor, and for backward compatibility, implementing this DDSI is optional.</p>
