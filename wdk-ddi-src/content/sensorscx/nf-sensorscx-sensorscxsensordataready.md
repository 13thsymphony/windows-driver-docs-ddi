# SensorsCxSensorDataReady function
This function notifies the class extension that the driver has retrieved data.

## Syntax

````
FORCEINLINE NTSTATUS SensorsCxSensorDataReady(
  _In_ SENSOROBJECT            Sensor,
  _In_ PSENSOR_COLLECTION_LIST pSensorData
);
````

## Parameters

`Sensor`

A reference to a sensor object.

`pSensorData`

A list of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn946698">Sensor properties</a>. For more information, see <a href="..\sensorsdef\ns-sensorsdef-sensor_collection_list.md">SENSOR_COLLECTION_LIST</a>.


## Return Value

This function returns NTSTATUS with different values. Some values that may be returned are the following:

<ul>
<li>
STATUS_SUCCESS is returned if the function completes successfully.

</li>
<li>
STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL is returned if the function does not complete successfully.

</li>
<li>
STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER is returned if any of the _In_ parameters are NULL.

</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Any client that calls  SensorsCxSensorDataReady must make sure that SensorsCxSensorDataReady is Started, before the call is made.
        Calling SensorsCxSensorDataReady before it is Started can cause the sensor class extension to become unresponsive.</div>
<div> </div>

## Remarks

This function is implemented by the class extension and the driver must call it. Note that when batch latency expires for sensor drivers
    that support data batching, <b>SensorsCxSensorDataReady</b> is called repeatedly until all the batched data samples are delivered to the client.
    For more information about the callback function related to  batch latency, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt219125">EvtSensorSetBatchLatency</a>.
