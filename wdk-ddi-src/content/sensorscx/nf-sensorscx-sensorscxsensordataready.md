# SensorsCxSensorDataReady function



## -description
This function notifies the class extension that the driver has retrieved data.



## -syntax

````
FORCEINLINE NTSTATUS SensorsCxSensorDataReady(
  _In_ SENSOROBJECT            Sensor,
  _In_ PSENSOR_COLLECTION_LIST pSensorData
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Sensor [in]

A reference to a sensor object.


### -param pSensorData [in]

A list of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn946698">Sensor properties</a>. For more information, see <a href="..\sensorsdef\ns-sensorsdef-sensor_collection_list.md">SENSOR_COLLECTION_LIST</a>.


## -returns
This function returns NTSTATUS with different values. Some values that may be returned are the following:

STATUS_SUCCESS is returned if the function completes successfully.

STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL is returned if the function does not complete successfully.

STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER is returned if any of the _In_ parameters are NULL.


## -remarks
This function is implemented by the class extension and the driver must call it. Note that when batch latency expires for sensor drivers
    that support data batching, <b>SensorsCxSensorDataReady</b> is called repeatedly until all the batched data samples are delivered to the client.
    For more information about the callback function related to  batch latency, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt219125">EvtSensorSetBatchLatency</a>.
