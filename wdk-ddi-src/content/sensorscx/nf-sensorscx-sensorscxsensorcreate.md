# SensorsCxSensorCreate function
This function creates an instance of a sensor in the class extension.

## Syntax

````
FORCEINLINE NTSTATUS SensorsCxSensorCreate(
  _In_  WDFDEVICE              FxDevice,
  _In_  PWDF_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES pSensorAttributes,
  _Out_ PSENSOROBJECT          pSensor
);
````

## Parameters

`FxDevice`

A WDFDEVICE handle to the framework device object that represents the sensor.

`pSensorAttributes`

A reference to <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=313456">WDF_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES</a>.

`pSensor`

A reference to a sensor object that is used within the class extension.


## Return Value

This function returns NTSTATUS with different values. Some values that may be returned are the following:

<ul>
<li>
STATUS_SUCCESS is returned when the function completes successfully.

</li>
<li>
STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER is returned if any of the _In_ parameters are NULL.

</li>
<li>
STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES is returned if there were insufficient resources to allocate memory for this function.

</li>
</ul>

## Remarks

SensorsCxSensorCreate is implemented by the class extension and must be called by the driver. 



<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  If pSensorAttributes-&gt;ParentObject is not set to NULL or FxDevice, then SensorsCxSensorCreate will fail. If pSensorAttributes-&gt;ParentObject is NULL, then the class extension (CX) will set it to FxDevice.</div>
<div> </div>
 

The sensors class extension writes a set of properties for each sensor when SensorsCxSensorCreate. For information about these properties, see Enumeration properties.
