# EVT_SENSOR_DRIVER_DISABLE_WAKE function
Callback to disable wake for the sensor.

## Syntax

```
EVT_SENSOR_DRIVER_DISABLE_WAKE EvtSensorDriverDisableWake;

_IRQL_requires_same_ NTSTATUS EvtSensorDriverDisableWake(
  SENSOROBJECT Sensor
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Sensor`

A reference to the sensor object


## Return Value

This function returns STATUS_SUCCESS when completed successfully.

## Remarks

This DDSI function does not compulsorily have to be implemented by the driver because it is expected that some sensor drivers do not care about disabling wake on the sensor. If it not implemented the enable call is ignored and a STATUS_SUCCESS is returned. This is primarily because PKEY_Sensor_WakeCapable is implemented today and used by some sensors such as the accelerometer and the proximity sensor, and for backward compatibility, implementing this DDSI is optional.</p>
