# Mrx.h header



This header is used by Installable file system. For more information, see
- [Installable file system](../_ifsk/index.md)

Mrx.h contain these programming interfaces:


## Functions

| Title   | Description   |
| ---- |:---- |
| [RxFsdDispatch function](nf-mrx-rxfsddispatch.md) | RxFsdDispatch implements the file system driver (FSD) dispatch for RDBSS to process an I/O request packet (IRP). |
| [RxMakeLateDeviceAvailable function](nf-mrx-rxmakelatedeviceavailable.md) | RxMakeLateDeviceAvailable modifies the device object to make a &#0034;late device&#0034; available. A late device is one that is not created in the driver's load routine. |
| [RxRegisterMinirdr function](nf-mrx-rxregisterminirdr.md) | RxRegisterMinirdr is called by a network mini-redirector driver to register the driver with RDBSS, which adds the registration information to an internal registration table. RDBSS also builds a device object for the network mini-redirector. |
| [RxSetDomainForMailslotBroadcast function](nf-mrx-rxsetdomainformailslotbroadcast.md) | RxSetDomainForMailslotBroadcast is called by a network mini-redirector driver to set the domain used for mailslot broadcasts if mailslots are supported by the driver. |
| [RxStartMinirdr function](nf-mrx-rxstartminirdr.md) | RxStartMinirdr is called to start up a network mini-redirector that has previously called to register with RDBSS. |
| [RxStopMinirdr function](nf-mrx-rxstopminirdr.md) | RxStopMinirdr is called to stop a network mini-redirector that has previously been started. |
| [RxpUnregisterMinirdr function](nf-mrx-rxpunregisterminirdr.md) | RxpUnregisterMinirdr is called by a network mini-redirector driver to de-register the driver with RDBSS and remove the registration information from the internal RDBSS registration table. |
| [__RxFillAndInstallFastIoDispatch function](nf-mrx-__rxfillandinstallfastiodispatch.md) | RxFillAndInstallFastIoDispatch fills out a fast I/O dispatch vector to be identical with the normal dispatch I/O vector and installs it into the driver object associated with the device object passed. |
