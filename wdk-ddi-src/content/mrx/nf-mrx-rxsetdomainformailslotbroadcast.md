# RxSetDomainForMailslotBroadcast function
<b>RxSetDomainForMailslotBroadcast</b> is called by a network mini-redirector driver to set the domain used for mailslot broadcasts if mailslots are supported by the driver.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS RxSetDomainForMailslotBroadcast(
  _In_ PUNICODE_STRING DomainName
);
````

## Parameters

`DomainName`

A pointer to a buffer that contains a zero-terminated Unicode string that names the domain to use for mailslots.


## Return Value

<b>RxSetDomainForMailslotBroadcast</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS on success or one of the following error values on failure: 

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>

<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
There were insufficient resources to complete this routine. The memory allocation request failed for nonpaged pool memory to store the domain name.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

A network mini-redirector registers with RDBSS whenever the driver is loaded by the kernel and unregisters with RDBSS when the driver is unloaded. This registration process is a two-way hand shake in which the network mini-redirector informs RDBSS that it has been loaded by calling <b>RxRegisterMinirdr</b>, the registration routine exported from RDBSS. RDBSS completes the registration and initialization process by calling <b>MrxStart</b>, one of the callback routines exported by the network mini-redirector and passed in as part of the dispatch table to <b>RxRegisterMinirdr</b>.

One of the parameters passed to the <b>RxRegisterMinirdr</b> routine indicates whether the network mini-redirector supports mailslots. A network mini-redirector would normally call <b>RxSetDomainForMailslotBroadcast</b> from the <b>MrxStart</b> routine or as part of an external request to start the driver initiated by a file system control (FSCTRL) or an I/O control (IOCTL) request from a user-mode application or service.
