# PMRX_CALLDOWN_CTX callback function
The<i>MRxStart</i> routine is called by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/the-rdbss-driver-and-library">RDBSS</a> to start the network mini-redirector.

## Syntax

```
PMRX_CALLDOWN_CTX PmrxCalldownCtx;

NTSTATUS PmrxCalldownCtx(
  IN OUT PRX_CONTEXT RxContext,
  IN OUT PRDBSS_DEVICE_OBJECT RxDeviceObject
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`RxContext`

A pointer to the RX_CONTEXT structure. This parameter contains the IRP that requested the network mini-redirector to start.

`RxDeviceObject`

A pointer to the RDBSS_DEVICE_OBJECT structure for this network mini-redirector.


## Return Value

<i>MRxStart</i> returns STATUS_SUCCESS on success or an appropriate NTSTATUS value, such as one of the following: 
<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_REDIRECTOR_STARTED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The network mini-redirector was already started.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The network mini-redirector was unable to start successfully.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

<i>MRxStart</i> completes the initialization of the network mini-redirector from the RDBSS perspective. Note that this is different from the initialization done in the <b>DriverEntry</b> routine. Any initialization that depends on RDBSS should be done as part of this routine while the initialization that is independent of RDBSS should be done in the <b>DriverEntry</b> routine.

Before calling <i>MRxStart</i>, RDBSS modifies the following members in the RX_CONTEXT structure pointed to by the <i>RxContext</i> parameter:

The <b>MajorFunction</b> member is set to the major function of the IRP. 

The <b>LowIoContext.ParamsFor.FsCtl.FsControlCode</b> member is set to the FSCTL code for the IRP if this was an FSTCL request used to start the network mini-redirector. 

<i>MRxStart</i> is called by RDBSS from the <a href="..\mrx\nf-mrx-rxstartminirdr.md">RxStartMinirdr</a> routine. Before calling <i>MRxStart</i>, RDBSS will register <i>RxDeviceObject</i> of the network mini-redirector as a file system. RDBSS will also register the network mini-redirector as a UNC provider if the network mini-redirector indicates support for UNC names.

If <i>MRxStart</i> returns STATUS_SUCCESS, then the routine was successful. Any other return value indicates that an error occurred in the startup sequence. 

If <i>MRxStart</i> returns STATUS_SUCCESS, RDBSS sets the state of RDBSS to RDBSS_STARTED. This state is stored in the <b>StartStopContext.State</b> member of the RDBSS_DEVICE_OBJECT structure pointed to by <i>RxDeviceObject</i>.

A network mini-redirector would normally maintain an internal variable indicating whether the network mini-redirector is started. For example, a network mini-redirector might track when it is stopped, started, and when a start operation or stop operation is in progress.
