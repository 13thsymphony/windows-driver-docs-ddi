# GNSS_GEOFENCES_TRACKINGSTATUS_DATA structure
This structure is used by the GNSS engine to notify of any changes in the tracking status while tracking a set of previously created geofences.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct GNSS_GEOFENCES_TRACKINGSTATUS_DATA {
  ULONG    Size;
  ULONG    Version;
  NTSTATUS Status;
  FILETIME StatusTimeStamp;
  BYTE     Unused[512];
}  *PGNSS_GEOFENCES_TRACKINGSTATUS_DATA;
```

## Members


`Size`

Structure size.

`Version`

Version number.

`Status`

A failure code indicates that the GNSS engine is unable to track the geofences (due to bad signal conditions or other transient errors).

A success code indicates that the GNSS engine was previously unable to track geofences, and is now able to track them.

`StatusTimeStamp`

The UTC time of this status.

`Unused`



## Remarks
The GNSS engine must not raise  events when it is not tracking any mobile-originated geofences (but tracking network-initiated Geofences), or when the geofence tracking has been reset by the GNSS_ResetGeofenceTracking command.
