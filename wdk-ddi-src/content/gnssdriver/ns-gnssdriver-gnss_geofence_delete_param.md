# GNSS_GEOFENCE_DELETE_PARAM structure
This structure is used for deleting a geofence.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct GNSS_GEOFENCE_DELETE_PARAM {
  ULONG Size;
  ULONG Version;
  ULONG GeofenceID;
  BYTE  Unused[512];
}  *PGNSS_GEOFENCE_DELETE_PARAM;
```

## Members


`Size`

Structure size.

`Version`

Version number.

`GeofenceID`

The ID of the geofence.

 This ID was generated by the GNSS engine during creation of the geofence. Once deleted, the ID can be recycled by the GNSS engine and assigned to a newly created geofence.

`Unused`
