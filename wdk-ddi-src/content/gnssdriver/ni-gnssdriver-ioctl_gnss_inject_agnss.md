# IOCTL_GNSS_INJECT_AGNSS IOCTL



## -description
The <b>IOCTL_GNSS_INJECT_AGNSS</b> control code is used by the GNSS adapter to inject AGNSS data into the driver. This IOCTL is sent as a result of the driver previously responding to a pending <a href="..\gnssdriver\ni-gnssdriver-ioctl_gnss_listen_agnss.md">IOCTL_GNSS_LISTEN_AGNSS</a> request. 


## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
A pointer to a <a href="sensors.gnss_agnss_inject">GNSS_AGNSS_INJECT</a> structure.

### -input-buffer-length
Set to sizeof(GNSS_AGNSS_INJECT).

### -output-buffer
Set to <b>NULL</b>.

### -output-buffer-length
Set to 0.

### -in-out-buffer

<text></text>

### -inout-buffer-length

<text></text>

### -status-block
I/O Status block
<b>Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status</b> is set to STATUS_SUCCESS if the request is successful. Otherwise, <b>Status</b> to the appropriate error condition as a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7792201b-63bb-4db5-803d-2af02893d505">NTSTATUS</a> code. 

## -remarks

<a href="sensors.gnss_agnss_inject">GNSS_AGNSS_INJECT</a>


Depending on the InjectionType element, the appropriate data element is filled.

NTSTATUS with the following indications:

Success: AGNSS data injection was accepted.

Failed: AGNSS data injection failed.

When the GNSS adapter fails to get time for injection, it sets the InjectionStatus element. The driver must check that this element indicates success, before actually using the element data.

In case of failure in gathering injection data, the adapter does not automatically retry. It is up to the driver to retry the same request sequent.

This is a fire-and-forget IOCTL. The GNSS adapter does not handle error even if the driver returns a failure indicating that the injection data was not used.

The GNSS driver completes the I/O request after consuming the injection data.
