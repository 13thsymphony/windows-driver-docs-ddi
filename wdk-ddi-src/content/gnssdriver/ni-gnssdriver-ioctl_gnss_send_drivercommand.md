# IOCTL_GNSS_SEND_DRIVERCOMMAND IOCTL



## -description
The <b>IOCTL_GNSS_SEND_DRIVERCOMMAND</b> control code is used by the GNSS adapter to execute well-defined commands on the driver and also to set driver configuration parameters. Each call specifies a certain command type, and the associated data for the command (if one is applicable) through the <a href="sensors.gnss_drivercommand_param">GNSS_DRIVERCOMMAND_PARAM</a> structure.


## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer
A pointer to a <a href="sensors.gnss_drivercommand_param">GNSS_DRIVERCOMMAND_PARAM</a> structure.

### -input-buffer-length
Set to sizeof(GNSS_DRIVERCOMMAND_PARAM).

### -output-buffer
Set to NULL.

### -output-buffer-length
Set to 0.

### -in-out-buffer

<text></text>

### -inout-buffer-length

<text></text>

### -status-block
I/O Status block
<b>Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status</b> is set to STATUS_SUCCESS if the request is successful. Otherwise, <b>Status</b> to the appropriate error condition as a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7792201b-63bb-4db5-803d-2af02893d505">NTSTATUS</a> code. 

## -remarks
The driver sets one of the following NTSTATUS values to indicate the result.

STATUS_SUCCESS



Command Not Supported

Command Not Executed

Command Deferred

Command Failed

With the exception of a few commands, the GNSS adapter generally ignores any failures encountered in executing a specific command.

If the GNSS driver does not support a specific command, it indicates so. Drivers are not required to support all commands defined in this protocol. The driver should complete the I/O only after finishing executing of the command.
