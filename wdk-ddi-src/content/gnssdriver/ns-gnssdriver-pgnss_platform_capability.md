# PGNSS_PLATFORM_CAPABILITY structure



## -description
This structure is used to communicate the platform/HLOS capabilities to the underlying GNSS driver.


## -syntax

````
typedef struct {
  ULONG Size;
  ULONG Version;
  BOOL  SupportAgnssInjection;
  ULONG AgnssFormatSupported;
  BOOL  Reserved;
  BYTE  Unused[512];
} GNSS_PLATFORM_CAPABILITY, *PGNSS_PLATFORM_CAPABILITY;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Size

Structure size.

### -field Version

Version number.

### -field SupportAgnssInjection

Indicates that the platform supports AGNSS injection via the location platform.

### -field AgnssFormatSupported

Specifies a bitmask containing the different AGNSS formats (GNSS_AGNSSFORMAT_*) that the GNSS driver or device supports.

### -field Reserved

Reserved for future use.

### -field Unused[512]

Padding buffer.

## -remarks
 This is a list of individual capability support of the GNSS adapter. The platform capability is represented in the same way as the device capabilities are represented.
