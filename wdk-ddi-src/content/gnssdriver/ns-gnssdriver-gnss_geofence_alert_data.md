# GNSS_GEOFENCE_ALERT_DATA structure
This structure is used by the GNSS engine to notify a geofence breach alert.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct GNSS_GEOFENCE_ALERT_DATA {
  ULONG                 Size;
  ULONG                 Version;
  ULONG                 GeofenceID;
  GNSS_GEOFENCE_STATE   GeofenceState;
  GNSS_FIXDATA_BASIC    FixBasicData;
  GNSS_FIXDATA_ACCURACY FixAccuracyData;
  BYTE                  Unused[512];
} *PGNSS_GEOFENCE_ALERT_DATA, GNSS_GEOFENCE_ALERT_DATA;
```

## Members


`Size`

Structure size.

`Version`

Version number.

`GeofenceID`

The ID of the geofence. This ID was generated by the GNSS engine during creation of the geofence.

`GeofenceState`

The new state of the geofence. The alert implies transitioning to this state.

`FixBasicData`

The fix used to determine the geofence breach. Instead of the full set of fix data, a smaller subset contained in this field and the  FixAccuracyData field is expected.

`FixAccuracyData`

The fix used to determine the geofence breach. Instead of the full set of fix data, a smaller subset contained in this field and the  FixBasicData field is expected.

`Unused`
