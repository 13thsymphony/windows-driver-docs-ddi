# PGNSS_GEOFENCE_ALERT_DATA structure



## -description
This structure is used by the GNSS engine to notify a geofence breach alert.


## -syntax

````
typedef struct {
  ULONG                 Size;

  GNSS_GEOFENCE_STATE   GeofenceState;

## -struct-fields

### -field Size

Structure size.

### -field Version

Version number.

### -field GeofenceID

The ID of the geofence. This ID was generated by the GNSS engine during creation of the geofence.

### -field GeofenceState

The new state of the geofence. The alert implies transitioning to this state.

### -field FixBasicData

The fix used to determine the geofence breach. Instead of the full set of fix data, a smaller subset contained in this field and the  FixAccuracyData field is expected.

### -field FixAccuracyData

The fix used to determine the geofence breach. Instead of the full set of fix data, a smaller subset contained in this field and the  FixBasicData field is expected.

### -field Unused[512]

Padding buffer.
