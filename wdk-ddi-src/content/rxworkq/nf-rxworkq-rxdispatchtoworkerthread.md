# RxDispatchToWorkerThread function
<b>RxDispatchToWorkerThread</b> invokes a routine in the context of a worker thread. The memory for the WORK_QUEUE_ITEM is allocated by this routine.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS RxDispatchToWorkerThread(
  _In_ PRDBSS_DEVICE_OBJECT     pMRxDeviceObject,
  _In_ WORK_QUEUE_TYPE          WorkQueueType,
  _In_ PRX_WORKERTHREAD_ROUTINE Routine,
  _In_ PVOID                    pContext
);
````

## Parameters

`pMRxDeviceObject`

A pointer to the device object of the corresponding network mini-redirector driver.

`WorkQueueType`

The type of the work queue representing the priority of the task. The <i>WorkQueueType</i> parameter can be one of can be one of the following enumerations for WORK_QUEUE_TYPE:




#### CriticalWorkQueue

Insert the WORK_QUEUE_ITEM into the queue from which a system thread with a real-time priority attribute will process the work item.


#### DelayedWorkQueue

Insert the WORK_QUEUE_ITEM into the queue from which a system thread with a variable priority attribute will process the work item.


#### HyperCriticalWorkQueue

Insert the WORK_QUEUE_ITEM into the queue from which a system thread will process the work item so that the routine to be invoked is not blocked.

`Routine`

A pointer to the routine to be invoked.

`pContext`

A pointer to a context parameter associated with the work item to complete that is passed to the driver.


## Return Value

<b>RxDispatchToWorkerThread</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS on success or one of the following error codes on failure: 
<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The item could not be dispatched.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

There are two common cases of dispatching operations to worker threads:
<ul>
<li>
For a very infrequent operation, space can be conserved by dynamically allocating and freeing memory for the work queue item when its is needed. The <b>RxDispatchToWorkerThread</b> routine would be used in this case 

</li>
<li>
When an operation is going to be repeatedly dispatched, time is conserved by allocating in advance the WORK_QUEUE_ITEM as part of the data structure to be dispatched and using this pre-allocated memory repeatedly. The <a href="..\rxworkq\nf-rxworkq-rxposttoworkerthread.md">RxPostToWorkerThread</a> routine would be used in this case 

</li>
</ul>The trade off between the two dispatching operations is time versus space (memory usage).

The <b>RxDispatchToWorkerThread</b> invokes a routine in the context of a worker thread. The memory for the WORK_QUEUE_ITEM is allocated by the <b>RxDispatchToWorkerThread</b> routine from non-paged pool memory. Hence this routine can fail if insufficient resources are available. 

The current implementation of the <b>RxDispatchToWorkerThread </b>routine queues work onto the same processor from which the call originated. 

If the <b>RxDispatchToWorkerThread </b>routine fails on a debug build, the <b>_RxLog</b> routine is called with details of the error. If the <b>RxDispatchToWorkerThread </b>routine fails and WMI is enabled in the kernel, details of the error will be logged with WMI.
