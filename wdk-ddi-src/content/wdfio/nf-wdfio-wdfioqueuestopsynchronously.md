# WdfIoQueueStopSynchronously function
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]

The <b>WdfIoQueueStopSynchronously</b> method prevents an I/O queue from delivering I/O requests, but the queue receives and stores new requests. The method returns after all delivered requests have been canceled or completed.

## Syntax

````
VOID WdfIoQueueStopSynchronously(
  _In_ WDFQUEUE Queue
);
````

## Parameters

`Queue`

A handle to a framework queue object.


## Return Value

None.

A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.

## Remarks

The <b>WdfIoQueueStopSynchronously</b> method enables the queue to receive new requests, even if the queue was not receiving new requests before the driver called <b>WdfIoQueueStopSynchronously</b>. For example, a driver might call <a href="..\wdfio\nf-wdfio-wdfioqueuedrain.md">WdfIoQueueDrain</a>, which causes the framework to stop adding new I/O requests to the queue. The driver's subsequent call of <b>WdfIoQueueStopSynchronously</b> causes the framework to resume adding requests to the queue.

Do not call <b>WdfIoQueueStopSynchronously</b> from the following queue object event callback functions, regardless of the queue with which the event callback function is associated:

<a href="..\wdfio\nc-wdfio-evt_wdf_io_queue_io_default.md">EvtIoDefault</a>
<a href="..\wdfio\nc-wdfio-evt_wdf_io_queue_io_device_control.md">EvtIoDeviceControl</a>
<a href="..\wdfio\nc-wdfio-evt_wdf_io_queue_io_internal_device_control.md">EvtIoInternalDeviceControl</a>
<a href="..\wdfio\nc-wdfio-evt_wdf_io_queue_io_read.md">EvtIoRead</a>
<a href="..\wdfio\nc-wdfio-evt_wdf_io_queue_io_write.md">EvtIoWrite</a>
For more information about the <b>WdfIoQueueStopSynchronously</b> method, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/managing-i-o-queues">Managing I/O Queues</a>.


#### Examples

The following code example stops a specified queue.

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>WdfIoQueueStopSynchronously(WriteQueue);</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
