# WdfIoQueueDrainSynchronously function
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]

The <b>WdfIoQueueDrainSynchronously</b> method causes the framework to stop queuing I/O requests to an I/O queue, while allowing already-queued requests to be delivered and processed. The method returns after all requests are completed or canceled.

## Syntax

````
VOID WdfIoQueueDrainSynchronously(
  _In_ WDFQUEUE Queue
);
````

## Parameters

`Queue`

A handle to a framework queue object.


## Return Value

None.

A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.

## Remarks

After a driver calls <b>WdfIoQueueDrainSynchronously</b>, the framework stops adding I/O requests to the specified queue. If the framework receives additional requests for the queue, it completes them with a completion status value of STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_STATE.

The driver should not call another method that changes queue state, such as <a href="..\wdfio\nf-wdfio-wdfioqueuepurge.md">WdfIoQueuePurge</a> or <a href="..\wdfio\nf-wdfio-wdfioqueuestart.md">WdfIoQueueStart</a>, before the call to <b>WdfIoQueueDrainSynchronously</b> has returned.

As a best practice, you should only call <b>WdfIoQueueDrainSynchronously</b> when you are certain that the queue's pending I/O requests will complete in a timely fashion. Otherwise, use <a href="..\wdfio\nf-wdfio-wdfioqueuepurgesynchronously.md">WdfIoQueuePurgeSynchronously</a>.  For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/managing-i-o-queues">Managing I/O Queues</a>.

After a driver has drained an I/O queue, it can restart the queue by calling <a href="..\wdfio\nf-wdfio-wdfioqueuestart.md">WdfIoQueueStart</a>.

Do not call <b>WdfIoQueueDrainSynchronously</b> from the following queue object event callback functions, regardless of the queue with which the event callback function is associated:
<a href="..\wdfio\nc-wdfio-evt_wdf_io_queue_io_default.md">EvtIoDefault</a><a href="..\wdfio\nc-wdfio-evt_wdf_io_queue_io_device_control.md">EvtIoDeviceControl</a><a href="..\wdfio\nc-wdfio-evt_wdf_io_queue_io_internal_device_control.md">EvtIoInternalDeviceControl</a><a href="..\wdfio\nc-wdfio-evt_wdf_io_queue_io_read.md">EvtIoRead</a><a href="..\wdfio\nc-wdfio-evt_wdf_io_queue_io_write.md">EvtIoWrite</a>
