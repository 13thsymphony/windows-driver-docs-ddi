# WdfIoQueueStopAndPurge function



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]


   The <b>WdfIoQueueStopAndPurge</b> method prevents an I/O queue from delivering new requests and cancels existing unprocessed requests and driver-owned cancellable requests, but the queue receives and stores new requests.



## -syntax

````
void WdfIoQueueStopAndPurge(
  _In_     WDFQUEUE               Queue,
  _In_opt_ PFN_WDF_IO_QUEUE_STATE  StopAndPurgeComplete,
  _In_opt_ WDFCONTEXT              Context
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Queue [in]

A handle to a framework queue object.


### -param  StopAndPurgeComplete [in, optional]

A pointer to a driver-supplied <a href="..\wdfio\nc-wdfio-evt_wdf_io_queue_state.md">EvtIoQueueState</a> callback function. This parameter is optional and can be NULL.


### -param  Context [in, optional]

An untyped pointer to driver-supplied context information that the framework passes to the <a href="..\wdfio\nc-wdfio-evt_wdf_io_queue_state.md">EvtIoQueueState</a> callback function. This parameter is optional and can be NULL.


## -returns
This method does not return a value.


## -remarks

   The <b>WdfIoQueueStopAndPurge</b> method prevents an I/O queue from delivering I/O requests to the driver while allowing new requests to be added to the queue.
  In addition, it cancels unprocessed requests in the queue and driver-owned cancellable requests (requests that were delivered to the driver that driver has not completed or requeued). If new requests are added while <b>WdfIoQueueStopAndPurge</b> is in progress, these new requests are not delivered until driver calls <a href="wdf.wdfioqueuestart">WdfIoQueueStart</a>.

In contrast, the <a href="wdf.wdfioqueuestop">WdfIoQueueStop</a> method does not cancel unprocessed requests in the queue or driver-owned cancellable requests.

If this method causes the framework to cancel an unprocessed request in a queue, the framework calls the driver's <a href="..\wdfio\nc-wdfio-evt_wdf_io_queue_io_canceled_on_queue.md">EvtIoCanceledOnQueue</a> callback function for that queue, if the driver has supplied one.


    If the driver supplies an <a href="..\wdfio\nc-wdfio-evt_wdf_io_queue_state.md">EvtIoQueueState</a> callback function, the framework calls it after all requests that were delivered to the driver have been completed or canceled.

The <b>WdfIoQueueStopAndPurge</b> method enables the queue to receive new requests, even if the queue was not receiving new requests before the driver called <b>WdfIoQueueStopAndPurge</b>. For example, a driver might call <a href="wdf.wdfioqueuedrain">WdfIoQueueDrain</a>, which causes the framework to stop adding new I/O requests to the queue. The driver's subsequent call of <b>WdfIoQueueStopAndPurge</b> causes the framework to resume adding requests to the queue.


In contrast, <a href="wdf.wdfioqueuepurge">WdfIoQueuePurge</a> causes the framework to stop adding I/O requests to the specified queue.

A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.

The following code example stops and purges a specified I/O queue. After all requests that were delivered to the driver have been completed or canceled, the framework calls a driver's EvtIoQueueStateStopAndPurge function.
