# EVT_WDF_IO_QUEUE_IO_CANCELED_ON_QUEUE function
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]

A driver's <i>EvtIoCanceledOnQueue</i> event callback function informs the driver that it must complete an I/O request that the framework has removed from an I/O queue.

## Syntax

```
EVT_WDF_IO_QUEUE_IO_CANCELED_ON_QUEUE EvtWdfIoQueueIoCanceledOnQueue;

void EvtWdfIoQueueIoCanceledOnQueue(
  WDFQUEUE Queue,
  WDFREQUEST Request
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Queue`

A handle to an I/O queue object.

`Request`

A handle to a request object.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

A driver registers an <i>EvtIoCanceledOnQueue</i> callback function when it calls the <a href="..\wdfio\nf-wdfio-wdfioqueuecreate.md">WdfIoQueueCreate</a> method. For more information about calling <b>WdfIoQueueCreate</b>, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/creating-i-o-queues">Creating I/O Queues</a>.

If a driver registers an <i>EvtIoCanceledOnQueue</i> callback function for an I/O queue, the framework calls the callback function in the following situations:
<ul>
<li>
A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/request-handlers">request handler</a> receives an I/O request from an I/O queue, the driver calls <a href="..\wdfrequest\nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestforwardtoioqueue.md">WdfRequestForwardToIoQueue</a>, <a href="..\wdfrequest\nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestforwardtoparentdeviceioqueue.md">WdfRequestForwardToParentDeviceIoQueue</a>, or <a href="..\wdfrequest\nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestrequeue.md">WdfRequestRequeue</a> to requeue the request to the I/O queue for which the <i>EvtIoCanceledOnQueue</i> callback function is registered, and the associated I/O operation is subsequently canceled.

</li>
<li>
The driver's <a href="..\wdfdevice\nc-wdfdevice-evt_wdf_io_in_caller_context.md">EvtIoInCallerContext</a> callback function receives an I/O request, the driver calls <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdfdeviceenqueuerequest.md">WdfDeviceEnqueueRequest</a> to pass the request back to the framework, the framework then places the request in the I/O queue for which the <i>EvtIoCanceledOnQueue</i> callback function is registered, and the associated I/O operation is subsequently canceled.

</li>
</ul>After the framework calls the <i>EvtIoCanceledOnQueue</i> callback function, the driver <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/request-ownership">owns</a> the request object and must <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/completing-i-o-requests">complete</a> the request with an appropriate status code, either in <i>EvtIoCanceledOnQueue</i> or later.  When the framework calls <i>EvtIoCanceledOnQueue</i>, the request is still associated with the I/O queue, but the driver cannot requeue the request. The ownership of the request stays with the driver even if the driver does not complete the request in <i>EvtIoCanceledOnQueue</i>. If the driver completes the request after <i>EvtIoCanceledOnQueue</i> returns, it cannot call <a href="..\wdfio\nf-wdfio-wdfioqueuefindrequest.md">WdfIoQueueFindRequest</a>  and <a href="..\wdfio\nf-wdfio-wdfioqueueretrievefoundrequest.md">WdfIoQueueRetrieveFoundRequest</a> to reacquire ownership of the request because the driver already has ownership of the request.

Typically, in <i>EvtIoCanceledOnQueue</i>, the driver <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/completing-i-o-requests">completes the I/O request</a> with a completion status of STATUS_CANCELLED.

In some cases, the driver might have previously requeued an I/O request to a manual queue, perhaps to wait for information.  For example, in one of its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/request-handlers">request handlers</a>, a driver might place an I/O request that is associated with a pending DMA transaction in a manual queue.  In this case, the driver attempts to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/canceling-dma-transactions">cancel the DMA transaction</a> in its <i>EvtIoCanceledOnQueue</i> callback. Depending on the results of the cancel operation, the driver completes the request with an appropriate status, either in <i>EvtIoCanceledOnQueue</i> or later.

The framework does not call the driver's <i>EvtIoCanceledOnQueue</i> callback function for I/O requests that the framework has never delivered to the driver.

The framework calls an <i>EvtIoCanceledOnQueue</i> callback function as soon as it determines that an I/O request has been canceled, regardless of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/dispatching-methods-for-i-o-requests">dispatching method</a> that the driver has set for the I/O queue. Therefore, the framework can call an <i>EvtIoCanceledOnQueue</i> callback function for:
<ul>
<li>
A request in a queue that uses <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/dispatching-methods-for-i-o-requests">sequential dispatching</a>, even if the driver currently owns another request from the queue.

</li>
<li>
A request in a queue for which the driver has set <a href="..\wdfio\ns-wdfio-_wdf_io_queue_config.md">NumberOfPresentedRequests</a>, even if the driver currently owns the maximum number of requests.

</li>
</ul>For more information about the <i>EvtIoCanceledOnQueue</i> callback function, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/canceling-i-o-requests">Canceling I/O Requests</a>.

The <i>EvtIoCanceledOnQueue</i> callback function can be called at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL, unless the <b>ExecutionLevel</b> member of the device or driver's <a href="..\wdfobject\ns-wdfobject-_wdf_object_attributes.md">WDF_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES</a> structure is set to <b>WdfExecutionLevelPassive</b>.

If the IRQL is PASSIVE_LEVEL, the framework calls the callback function within a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3781498a-45e9-4f24-8fd2-830eed61298c">critical region</a>.
