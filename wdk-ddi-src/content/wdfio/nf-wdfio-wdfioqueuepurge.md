# WdfIoQueuePurge function
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]

The <b>WdfIoQueuePurge</b> method causes the framework to stop queuing I/O requests to an I/O queue and to cancel unprocessed requests.

## Syntax

````
VOID WdfIoQueuePurge(
  _In_     WDFQUEUE               Queue,
  _In_opt_ PFN_WDF_IO_QUEUE_STATE PurgeComplete,
  _In_opt_ WDFCONTEXT             Context
);
````

## Parameters

`Queue`

A handle to a framework queue object.

`PurgeComplete`

A pointer to a driver-supplied <a href="..\wdfio\nc-wdfio-evt_wdf_io_queue_state.md">EvtIoQueueState</a> callback function. This parameter is optional and can be <b>NULL</b>.

`Context`

An untyped pointer to driver-supplied context information that the framework passes to the <a href="..\wdfio\nc-wdfio-evt_wdf_io_queue_state.md">EvtIoQueueState</a> callback function. This parameter is optional and can be <b>NULL</b>.


## Return Value

None.

A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.

## Remarks

After a driver calls <b>WdfIoQueuePurge</b>, the framework stops adding I/O requests to the specified queue. The framework <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/canceling-i-o-requests">cancels</a> all requests that it has not delivered to the target device and calls the driver's  <a href="..\wdfrequest\nc-wdfrequest-evt_wdf_request_completion_routine.md">CompletionRoutine</a> callback function  for each. The framework also attempts to cancel (by calling <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iocancelirp.md">IoCancelIrp</a>) any requests delivered to the target device that were not marked <a href="..\wdfrequest\ns-wdfrequest-_wdf_request_send_options.md">WDF_REQUEST_SEND_OPTION_IGNORE_TARGET_STATE</a>.

If the framework receives additional requests for the queue, it completes them with a completion status value of STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_STATE.

If the driver supplies an <a href="..\wdfio\nc-wdfio-evt_wdf_io_queue_state.md">EvtIoQueueState</a> callback function, the framework calls it after all requests that were delivered to the driver have been completed or canceled.

After a driver has purged an I/O queue, it can restart the queue by calling <a href="..\wdfio\nf-wdfio-wdfioqueuestart.md">WdfIoQueueStart</a>.

If the driver calls <a href="..\wdfrequest\nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestrequeue.md">WdfRequestRequeue</a> after calling <b>WdfIoQueuePurge</b>, the requeue attempt may succeed before the purge is complete. In versions 1.9 and earlier of KMDF, this 
sequence causes the operating system to crash.  This problem is fixed in KMDF version 1.11 and later.

For more information about the <b>WdfIoQueuePurge</b> method, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/managing-i-o-queues">Managing I/O Queues</a>.
