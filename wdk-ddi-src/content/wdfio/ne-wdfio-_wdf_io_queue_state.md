# _WDF_IO_QUEUE_STATE Enumeration
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]

The <b>WDF_IO_QUEUE_STATE</b> enumeration type identifies the status of a framework queue object. The enumerators are used as bit masks.

## Syntax
```
typedef enum _WDF_IO_QUEUE_STATE {
  WdfIoQueueAcceptRequests    ,
  WdfIoQueueDispatchRequests  ,
  WdfIoQueueNoRequests        ,
  WdfIoQueueDriverNoRequests  ,
  WdfIoQueuePnpHeld
} WDF_IO_QUEUE_STATE;
```

## Constants

<table>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>WdfIoQueueAcceptRequests</td>
                    <td>If set, the I/O queue can accept new I/O requests from the I/O manager and requests that are forwarded by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545920">WdfDeviceConfigureRequestDispatching</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549958">WdfRequestForwardToIoQueue</a> (or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549959">WdfRequestForwardToParentDeviceIoQueue</a>) methods. 

If not set, the framework cancels requests from the I/O manager and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545920">WdfDeviceConfigureRequestDispatching</a> and fails requests from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549958">WdfRequestForwardToIoQueue</a> (or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549959">WdfRequestForwardToParentDeviceIoQueue</a>) with STATUS_WDF_BUSY.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>WdfIoQueueDispatchRequests</td>
                    <td>If set, the framework delivers the queue's requests to the driver (unless the <b>WdfIoQueuePnpHeld</b> bit is also set). If not set, the driver cannot obtain requests from the queue.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>WdfIoQueueNoRequests</td>
                    <td>If set, the I/O queue is empty.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>WdfIoQueueDriverNoRequests</td>
                    <td>If set, all requests that have been delivered to the driver have been completed.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>WdfIoQueuePnpHeld</td>
                    <td>If set, the framework has stopped delivering requests to the driver because the underlying device is not in its working (D0) state.</td>
                </tr>
</table>

## Remarks

The WDF_IO_QUEUE_STATE enumeration type is used as the return value for the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548437">WdfIoQueueGetState</a> method.
