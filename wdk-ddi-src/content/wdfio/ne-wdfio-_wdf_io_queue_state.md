# _WDF_IO_QUEUE_STATE Enumeration
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]

The <b>WDF_IO_QUEUE_STATE</b> enumeration type identifies the status of a framework queue object. The enumerators are used as bit masks.

## Syntax
````
typedef enum _WDF_IO_QUEUE_STATE { 
  WdfIoQueueAcceptRequests    = 0x01,
  WdfIoQueueDispatchRequests  = 0x02,
  WdfIoQueueNoRequests        = 0x04,
  WdfIoQueueDriverNoRequests  = 0x08,
  WdfIoQueuePnpHeld           = 0x10
} WDF_IO_QUEUE_STATE;
````

## Constants

<table>

<tr>
<td>WdfIoQueueAcceptRequests</td>
<td>If set, the I/O queue can accept new I/O requests from the I/O manager and requests that are forwarded by the <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdfdeviceconfigurerequestdispatching.md">WdfDeviceConfigureRequestDispatching</a> and <a href="..\wdfrequest\nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestforwardtoioqueue.md">WdfRequestForwardToIoQueue</a> (or <a href="..\wdfrequest\nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestforwardtoparentdeviceioqueue.md">WdfRequestForwardToParentDeviceIoQueue</a>) methods. 

If not set, the framework cancels requests from the I/O manager and <a href="..\wdfdevice\nf-wdfdevice-wdfdeviceconfigurerequestdispatching.md">WdfDeviceConfigureRequestDispatching</a> and fails requests from <a href="..\wdfrequest\nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestforwardtoioqueue.md">WdfRequestForwardToIoQueue</a> (or <a href="..\wdfrequest\nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestforwardtoparentdeviceioqueue.md">WdfRequestForwardToParentDeviceIoQueue</a>) with STATUS_WDF_BUSY.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>WdfIoQueueDispatchRequests</td>
<td>If set, the framework delivers the queue's requests to the driver (unless the <b>WdfIoQueuePnpHeld</b> bit is also set). If not set, the driver cannot obtain requests from the queue.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>WdfIoQueueDriverNoRequests</td>
<td>If set, all requests that have been delivered to the driver have been completed.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>WdfIoQueueNoRequests</td>
<td>If set, the I/O queue is empty.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>WdfIoQueuePnpHeld</td>
<td>If set, the framework has stopped delivering requests to the driver because the underlying device is not in its working (D0) state.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

The WDF_IO_QUEUE_STATE enumeration type is used as the return value for the <a href="..\wdfio\nf-wdfio-wdfioqueuegetstate.md">WdfIoQueueGetState</a> method.

The following functions are defined in <i>wdfio.h</i>:



Returns <b>TRUE</b> if the <i>State</i> value indicates that the queue is drained; that is, the queue is empty, is not accepting new requests, and all requests that were in the queue have been delivered to the driver.

Returns <b>TRUE</b> if the <i>State</i> value indicates that the queue is idle; that is, the queue contains no requests and all delivered requests have been completed or canceled.

Returns <b>TRUE</b> if the <i>State</i> value indicates that the queue is purged; that is, the queue is empty, is not accepting new requests, and all requests that were in the queue have been canceled.

Returns <b>TRUE</b> if the <i>State</i> value indicates that the queue is ready; that is, the queue can accept and dispatch requests. 

Returns <b>TRUE</b> if the <i>State</i> value indicates that the queue is stopped; that is, it can accept new requests but the framework is not delivering them to the driver.
