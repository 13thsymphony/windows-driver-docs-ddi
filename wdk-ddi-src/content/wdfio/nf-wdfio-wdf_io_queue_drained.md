);
````

## Parameters

`State`

A <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ne-wudfddi_types-_wdf_io_queue_state.md">WDF_IO_QUEUE_STATE</a>-typed value that <a href="..\wdfio\nf-wdfio-wdfioqueuegetstate.md">WdfIoQueueGetState</a> returns.


## Return Value

<b>WDF_IO_QUEUE_DRAINED</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the specified queue state indicates that the queue is drained. Otherwise, the function returns <b>FALSE</b>.
