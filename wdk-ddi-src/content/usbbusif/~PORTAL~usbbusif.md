## Callback functions

| Title   | Description   |
| ---- |:---- |
| [USBC_START_DEVICE_CALLBACK callback](nc-usbbusif-usbc-start-device-callback.md) | The USBC_START_DEVICE_CALLBACK routine allows a USB client driver to provide a custom definition of the interface collections on a device. |

## Structures

| Title   | Description   |
| ---- |:---- |
| [USBC_DEVICE_CONFIGURATION_INTERFACE_V1 structure](ns-usbbusif--usbc-device-configuration-interface-v1.md) | The USBC_DEVICE_CONFIGURATION_INTERFACE_V1 structure is exposed by the vendor-supplied filter drivers to assist the USB generic parent driver in defining interface collections. |
| [USBC_FUNCTION_DESCRIPTOR structure](ns-usbbusif--usbc-function-descriptor.md) | The USBC_FUNCTION_DESCRIPTOR structure describes a USB function and its associated interface collection. |
| [USB_BUS_INFORMATION_LEVEL_0 structure](ns-usbbusif--usb-bus-information-level-0.md) | The USB_BUS_INFORMATION_LEVEL_0 structure is used in conjunction with the QueryBusInformation interface routine to report information about the bus. |
| [USB_BUS_INFORMATION_LEVEL_1 structure](ns-usbbusif--usb-bus-information-level-1.md) | The USB_BUS_INFORMATION_LEVEL_1 structure is used in conjunction with the QueryBusInformation interface routine to report information about the bus. |
| [USB_BUS_INTERFACE_USBDI_V0 structure](ns-usbbusif--usb-bus-interface-usbdi-v0.md) | The USB_BUS_INTERFACE_USBDI_V0 structure is provided by the USB hub driver to allow USB clients to make direct calls to the hub driver without allocating IRPs. |
| [USB_BUS_INTERFACE_USBDI_V1 structure](ns-usbbusif--usb-bus-interface-usbdi-v1.md) | The USB_BUS_INTERFACE_USBDI_V1 structure is provided by the USB hub driver to allow USB clients to make direct calls to the hub driver without allocating IRPs. |
| [USB_BUS_INTERFACE_USBDI_V2 structure](ns-usbbusif--usb-bus-interface-usbdi-v2.md) | The USB_BUS_INTERFACE_USBDI_V2 structure is provided by the USB hub driver to allow USB clients to make direct calls to the hub driver without allocating IRPs. |
| [USB_BUS_INTERFACE_USBDI_V3 structure](ns-usbbusif--usb-bus-interface-usbdi-v3.md) | The USB_BUS_INTERFACE_USBDI_V3 structure is provided by the USB hub driver to allow USB clients to make direct calls to the hub driver without allocating IRPs. |
