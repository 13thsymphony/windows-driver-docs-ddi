````
typedef struct _USB_BUS_INFORMATION_LEVEL_0 {
  ULONG TotalBandwidth;
  ULONG ConsumedBandwidth;
} USB_BUS_INFORMATION_LEVEL_0, *PUSB_BUS_INFORMATION_LEVEL_0;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field TotalBandwidth

Specifies the total bandwidth, in bits per second, available on the bus. 


### -field ConsumedBandwidth
