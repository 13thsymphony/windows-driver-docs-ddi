# IWDFIoQueue::PurgeSynchronously method



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>PurgeSynchronously</b> method directs the framework to reject new incoming I/O requests and to cancel all outstanding requests. The method returns after all outstanding requests are canceled.



## -syntax

````
void  PurgeSynchronously();
````


## -parameters


## -returns
None

None

None


## -remarks
The framework cancels unprocessed requests in the queue. For requests that are delivered to the driver and marked cancelable, the framework calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556903">IRequestCallbackCancel::OnCancel</a>. 

The <b>PurgeSynchronously</b> method is a synchronous version of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558962">IWDFIoQueue::Purge</a> method. That is, <b>PurgeSynchronously</b> does not return to the driver until all outstanding requests are canceled.
