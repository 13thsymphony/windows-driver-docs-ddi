# IWDFMemory::SetBuffer method



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>SetBuffer</b> method assigns a specified buffer to a memory object that a driver created by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558902">IWDFDriver::CreatePreallocatedWdfMemory</a>. 



## -syntax

````
void SetBuffer(
  [in] void   *Buffer,
  [in] SIZE_T BufferSize
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Buffer [in]

A pointer to a driver-supplied buffer.


### -param BufferSize [in]

The nonzero size, in bytes, of the buffer that <i>Buffer</i> points to. 


## -returns
None


## -remarks
The <b>SetBuffer</b> method can assign a buffer to a memory object that <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558902">IWDFDriver::CreatePreallocatedWdfMemory</a> created, but not to a memory object that <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558905">IWDFDriver::CreateWdfMemory</a> created.
