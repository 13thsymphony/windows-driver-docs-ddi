# TryToAcquireInterruptLock method
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>TryToAcquireInterruptLock</b> method acquires the interrupt lock if no other thread has already acquired it.

## Syntax

````
BOOLEAN TryToAcquireInterruptLock();
````

## Parameters

This function has no parameters.

## Return Value

The method returns TRUE if the interrupt lock was successfully acquired. Otherwise, the method returns FALSE.

## Remarks

Unlike <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2ED55AEC-2446-4E66-AAFD-A22BAB3FC9C7">IWDFInterrupt::AcquireInterruptLock</a>, <b>IWDFInterrupt::TryToAcquireInterruptLock</b> does not wait for the interrupt lock to become available if another thread is holding it.

When running in an arbitrary thread, such as an I/O queue callback method, drivers must call <b>IWDFInterrupt::TryToAcquireInterruptLock</b> instead of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2ED55AEC-2446-4E66-AAFD-A22BAB3FC9C7">IWDFInterrupt::AcquireInterruptLock</a>. For example, the driver calls <b>IWDFInterrupt::TryToAcquireInterruptLock</b> from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556875">IQueueCallbackRead::OnRead</a>. Doing so avoids the possibility of deadlock, as described in the Remarks section of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2ED55AEC-2446-4E66-AAFD-A22BAB3FC9C7">IWDFInterrupt::AcquireInterruptLock</a>.

The driver must not attempt to acquire the lock recursively. If connected to the debugger, the framework introduces a breakpoint in this scenario.

For more information about manual interrupt locking, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a24477dc-f75d-4ab6-8695-d8a85247e276">Synchronizing Interrupt Code</a>.
