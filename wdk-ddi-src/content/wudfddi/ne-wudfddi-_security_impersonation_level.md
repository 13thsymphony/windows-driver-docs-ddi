# _SECURITY_IMPERSONATION_LEVEL Enumeration
<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to UMDF only]

The <b>SECURITY_IMPERSONATION_LEVEL</b> enumeration contains values that identify security impersonation levels.

## Syntax
````
typedef enum _SECURITY_IMPERSONATION_LEVEL { 
  SecurityAnonymous       = 0,
  SecurityIdentification  = ( SecurityAnonymous + 1 ),
  SecurityImpersonation   = ( SecurityIdentification + 1 ),
  SecurityDelegation      = ( SecurityImpersonation + 1 )
} SECURITY_IMPERSONATION_LEVEL;
````

## Constants

<table>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>SecurityAnonymous</td>
                    <td>The driver cannot impersonate or identify the client.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>SecurityDelegation</td>
                    <td>The driver can impersonate the client's security context on remote systems.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>SecurityIdentification</td>
                    <td>The driver can obtain the identity and privileges of the client but cannot impersonate the client.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>SecurityImpersonation</td>
                    <td>The driver can impersonate the client's security context on the local system.</td>
                </tr>
</table>

    ## Remarks

        For more information about impersonation in the UMDF, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/handling-client-impersonation-in-umdf-drivers">Handling Client Impersonation</a>.

A UMDF driver supplies one of the values of <b>SECURITY_IMPERSONATION_LEVEL</b> to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559136">IWDFIoRequest::Impersonate</a> method to set the security impersonation level.

For more information about the security impersonation levels, see the <b>SECURITY_IMPERSONATION_LEVEL</b> enumeration type in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.
