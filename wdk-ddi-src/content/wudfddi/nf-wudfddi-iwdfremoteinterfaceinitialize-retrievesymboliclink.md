# IWDFRemoteInterfaceInitialize::RetrieveSymbolicLink method



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>RetrieveSymbolicLink</b> method retrieves the symbolic link name that the operating system assigned to a <a href="wdf.using_device_interfaces_in_umdf_drivers">device interface</a>. 



## -syntax

````
HRESULT RetrieveSymbolicLink(
  [out, optional] PWSTR pSymbolicLink,
  [in, out]       DWORD *pdwSymbolicLinkLengthInChars
);
````


## -parameters

### -param pSymbolicLink [out, optional]

A pointer to a buffer that receives a <b>null</b>-terminated Unicode character string that represents the symbolic link name. Set this pointer to <b>NULL</b> to obtain the required buffer size.


### -param pdwSymbolicLinkLengthInChars [in, out]

A pointer to a caller-allocated location. On input, this location must contain the caller-supplied length of the buffer that <i>pSymbolicLink</i> points to. On output, the location receives the length, in characters, of the symbolic link name, including the <b>NULL</b> terminating character.


## -returns
<b>RetrieveSymbolicLink</b> returns S_OK if the operation succeeds. Otherwise the method might return the following value:
<dl>
<dt><b>E_NOT_SUFFICIENT_BUFFER</b></dt>
</dl>The buffer that <i>pSymbolicLink</i> points to is too small. In this case, the framework stores the required buffer size in the location that <i>pdwSymbolicLinkLengthInChars</i> points to.

 

This method might return one of the other values that Winerror.h contains.


## -remarks
The symbolic link name can include an appended backslash (\) character, followed by an instance-specific reference string.

Typically, your driver should call <b>RetrieveSymbolicLink</b> twice, as follows:

Set the <i>pSymbolicLink</i> parameter to <b>NULL</b> and call <b>RetrieveSymbolicLink</b>. The location that <i>pdwSymbolicLinkLengthInChars</i> points to receives the number of characters that the symbolic link name contains.

Allocate a buffer that is large enough to receive the symbolic link name.

Call <b>RetrieveSymbolicLink</b> again, and set the <i>pSymbolicLink</i> parameter to the address of the buffer that you allocated.

For more information about the <b>RetrieveSymbolicLink</b> method, see <a href="wdf.using_device_interfaces_in_umdf_drivers">Using Device Interfaces in UMDF-based Drivers</a>.

The following code example shows how a driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556775">IPnpCallbackRemoteInterfaceNotification::OnRemoteInterfaceArrival</a> callback function can determine the length of device interface's symbolic link name, allocate a buffer for the name, and then retrieve the name.
