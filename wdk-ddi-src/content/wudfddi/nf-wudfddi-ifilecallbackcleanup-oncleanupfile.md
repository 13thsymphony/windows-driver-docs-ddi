# OnCleanupFile method
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>OnCleanupFile</b> method cancels all I/O requests that a driver has pending in the framework queue.

## Syntax

````
void OnCleanupFile(
  [in] IWDFFile *pWdfFileObject
);
````

## Parameters

`pWdfFileObject`

A pointer to the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdffile.md">IWDFFile</a> interface for the file object that is associated with the device.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

A driver registers the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-ifilecallbackcleanup.md">IFileCallbackCleanup</a> interface when the driver calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558899">IWDFDriver::CreateDevice</a> method to create a device object. 

The framework calls the <b>OnCleanupFile</b> method to notify the driver to cancel all I/O requests that it has pending. The framework notifies the driver in response to an application calling the Microsoft Win32 <b>CloseHandle</b> function. 

For information about when the framework calls <b>OnCleanupFile</b>, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/f81ae0ed-a29c-476e-9b16-ff554eef1de9">Driver-Created Versus Application-Created File Objects</a>.
