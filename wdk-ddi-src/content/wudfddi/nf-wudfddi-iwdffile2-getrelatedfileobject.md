# IWDFFile2::GetRelatedFileObject method



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>GetRelatedFileObject</b> method retrieves the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdffile.md">IWDFFile</a> interface of a <i>related file object</i>, which is a file object that has a technology-specific relationship with another file object.



## -syntax

````
void GetRelatedFileObject(
  [out] IWDFFile **ppRelatedFileObj
);
````


## -parameters

### -param ppRelatedFileObj [out]

The address of a location that receives a pointer to the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdffile.md">IWDFFile</a> interface of a UMDF file object. This file object is related to the file object that exposes the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdffile2.md">IWDFFile2</a> interface's parent <b>IWDFFile</b> interface.


## -returns
None.


## -remarks
Use of related file objects is technology-specific. For example, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/dcd28218-b3bf-4e5d-b1a7-6910103afb96">kernel streaming</a> uses related file objects to represent the parent filters of child pins.

For more information about related file objects, see the <b>GetRelatedFileObject</b> member of the kernel-mode <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_file_object.md">FILE_OBJECT</a> structure.

The following code example retrieves the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdffile.md">IWDFFile</a> interface of a related file object, from the <b>IWDFFile</b> interface that a driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556841">IQueueCallbackCreate::OnCreateFile</a>  callback function receives.
