# GetInputMemory method
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>GetInputMemory</b> method retrieves the memory object that represents the input buffer in an I/O request.

## Syntax

````
void GetInputMemory(
  [out] IWDFMemory **ppWdfMemory
);
````

## Parameters

`ppWdfMemory`

A pointer to a variable that receives a pointer to the reference-counted <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdfmemory.md">IWDFMemory</a> interface for the memory object. Note that returning <b>NULL</b> is valid; in this situation, no input memory is associated with the I/O request.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

Drivers that use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/accessing-data-buffers-in-wdf-drivers">buffered I/O</a> access method can call <b>GetInputMemory</b> to obtain an I/O request's input buffer.

Before a driver completes an I/O request, the driver must call the <b>IWDFMemory::Release</b> method for the memory object. The underlying memory object is freed when the request is completed.

The input buffer that is associated with the I/O request contains information (for example, data to be written to a disk) that the originator of the request supplied. The driver can call <b>GetInputMemory</b> to obtain the input buffer for a write request or a device I/O control request, but not for a read request (because read requests do not provide input data). To access the input buffer, the driver must call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560152">IWDFMemory::GetDataBuffer</a> method.

UMDF creates an I/O request's memory objects when it receives the I/O request, before it adds the I/O request to a driver's I/O queue. If UMDF cannot allocate memory for the memory objects, it completes the I/O request with a failure return status and does not deliver the I/O request to the driver.

For more information about accessing an I/O request's data buffers, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/accessing-data-buffers-in-wdf-drivers">Accessing Data Buffers in UMDF-Based Drivers</a>.
