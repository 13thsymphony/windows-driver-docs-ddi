# SetUserModeDriverInitiatedIo method
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>SetUserModeDriverInitiatedIo</b> method 
   
  indicates to kernel-mode drivers that sit below the UMDF driver in the same device stack that a particular request should be treated as though it came from a UMDF driver.

## Syntax

````
void SetUserModeDriverInitiatedIo(
  [in] BOOL IsUserModeDriverInitiated
);
````

## Parameters

`IsUserModeDriverInitiated`

A Boolean value that, if <b>TRUE</b>, indicates that the request should be treated as though it was initiated by a UMDF driver. If <b>FALSE</b>, this parameter indicates that the request should be treated as though it came from an application.


## Return Value

This method does not return a value.

## Remarks

If a UMDF driver calls this method with the <i>IsUserModeDriverInitiated</i> parameter set to <b>TRUE</b>, the framework sets the IRP_UM_DRIVER_INITIATED_IO flag in the <b>Flags</b> member of the WDM <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_irp.md">IRP</a> structure before forwarding the request to kernel-mode drivers.

A kernel-mode driver that resides below the UMDF driver in the same device stack can check for this flag to determine if the request should be treated as though initiated by a UMDF driver.

This flag is not applicable to kernel-mode drivers that might receive a request from a UMDF driver via a file-handle I/O target or a Win32 I/O target.

A UMDF driver might set the <i>IsUserModeDriverInitiated</i> parameter to <b>TRUE</b> for a request that came from an application if the driver has validated the request.

Requests that the driver created on its own are already marked as having originated from a UMDF driver.

The UMDF 2 equivalent of this method is <a href="..\wdfrequest\nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestsetusermodedriverinitiatedio.md">WdfRequestSetUserModeDriverInitiatedIo</a>.
