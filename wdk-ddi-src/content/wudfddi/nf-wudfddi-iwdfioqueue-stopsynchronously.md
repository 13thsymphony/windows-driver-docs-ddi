# IWDFIoQueue::StopSynchronously method
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>StopSynchronously</b> method prevents an I/O queue from delivering I/O requests, but the queue receives and stores new requests. The method returns after all delivered requests have been canceled or completed.

## Syntax

```
void StopSynchronously(

);
```

## Parameters

This function has no parameters.

## Return Value

None

## Remarks

The <b>StopSynchronously</b> method is the synchronous version of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558980">IWDFIoQueue::Stop</a> method. That is, <b>StopSynchronously</b> does not return to the driver until the queue stops.

The <b>StopSynchronously</b> method enables the queue to receive new requests, even if the queue was not receiving new requests before the driver called <b>StopSynchronously</b>. For example, a driver might call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558951">IWDFIoQueue::Drain</a>, which causes the framework to stop adding new I/O requests to the queue. The driver's subsequent call of <b>StopSynchronously</b> causes the framework to resume adding requests to the queue.
