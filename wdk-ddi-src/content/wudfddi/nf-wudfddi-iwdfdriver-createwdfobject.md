# CreateWdfObject method
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>CreateWdfObject</b> method creates a custom (or user) WDF object from a parent WDF object.

## Syntax

````
HRESULT CreateWdfObject(
  [in, optional] IUnknown   *pCallbackInterface,
  [in, optional] IWDFObject *pParentObject,
  [out]          IWDFObject **ppWdfObject
);
````

## Parameters

`pCallbackInterface`

A pointer to the <b>IUnknown</b> interface that the framework uses to determine the object-related event callback functions that the driver subscribes to on the newly created custom object. This parameter is optional. The driver can pass <b>NULL</b> if the driver does not require notification. If the driver passes a valid pointer, the framework will call <b>QueryInterface</b> on the <b>IUnknown</b> interface for the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iobjectcleanup.md">IObjectCleanup</a> interface. If the framework obtains the driver's <b>IObjectCleanup</b> interface, the framework can subsequently call the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556760">IObjectCleanup::OnCleanup</a> method to notify the driver that the custom object is cleaned up.

`pParentObject`

A pointer to the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdfobject.md">IWDFObject</a> interface for the parent WDF object. If <b>NULL</b>, the driver object becomes the default parent.

`ppWdfObject`

A pointer to a buffer that receives a pointer to the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdfobject.md">IWDFObject</a> interface for the newly created WDF object.


## Return Value

<b>CreateWdfObject</b> returns S_OK if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this method returns one of the error codes that are defined in Winerror.h.

## Remarks

The driver can call <b>CreateWdfObject</b> to create a general <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9d400192-faf0-4d8f-849b-6b955105e21a">framework base object</a> for its own use. The driver can associate context memory, assign a parent object, and register an <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iobjectcleanup.md">IObjectCleanup</a> interface. The framework subsequently calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556760">IObjectCleanup::OnCleanup</a> method to clean up the child object. 

If no parent object is specified at the <i>pParentObject</i> parameter, the driver becomes the default parent. Therefore, when the driver object is deleted, the framework cleans up the child object. 

If a parent object is assigned, the child object is deleted when the parent object is deleted. In other words, the lifetime of a child object is scoped within that of the parent. 

If the driver must clean up the child object before the parent object is deleted, the driver can call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560210">IWDFObject::DeleteWdfObject</a> method.
