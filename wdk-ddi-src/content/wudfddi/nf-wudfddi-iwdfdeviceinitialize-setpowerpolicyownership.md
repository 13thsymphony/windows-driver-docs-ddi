# IWDFDeviceInitialize::SetPowerPolicyOwnership method



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>SetPowerPolicyOwnership</b> method sets the ownership of the power policy to a driver or removes ownership from the driver.



## -syntax

````
void SetPowerPolicyOwnership(
  [in] BOOL fTrue
);
````


## -parameters

### -param fTrue [in]

A BOOL value that specifies whether to set power-policy ownership to the driver or remove ownership from the driver. <b>TRUE</b> indicates to set power-policy ownership to the driver; <b>FALSE</b> indicates to remove ownership from the driver.


## -returns
None


## -remarks
By default, UMDF drivers are not registered as power-policy owners for their device stack. To register itself as the power-policy owner for its device stack, a UMDF driver must explicitly call <b>SetPowerPolicyOwnership</b> and pass <b>TRUE</b> to the <i>fTrue</i> parameter in this call.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/cf543259-3401-4f3b-a492-53940cea07f3">Power Policy Ownership in UMDF</a>.

For a code example of how to use the <b>SetPowerPolicyOwnership</b> method, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558899">IWDFDriver::CreateDevice</a>.
