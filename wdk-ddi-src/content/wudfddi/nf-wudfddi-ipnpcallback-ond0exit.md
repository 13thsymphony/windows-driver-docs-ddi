# OnD0Exit method
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>OnD0Exit</b> method notifies a driver when a device exits the D0 power state so that the driver can perform necessary operations,  such as disabling the device.

## Syntax

````
HRESULT OnD0Exit(
  [in] IWDFDevice             *pWdfDevice,
  [in] WDF_POWER_DEVICE_STATE newState
);
````

## Parameters

`pWdfDevice`

A pointer to the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdfdevice.md">IWDFDevice</a> interface for the device object of the device that exits the D0 power state.

`newState`

A <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ne-wudfddi_types-_wdf_power_device_state.md">WDF_POWER_DEVICE_STATE</a>-typed value that identifies the new power state that the device is set to after it exits the D0 power state.


## Return Value

If the 
      <b>OnD0Exit</b> callback method encounters no errors, it must return S_OK or another status code for which SUCCEEDED(status) equals <b>TRUE</b>. Otherwise, it must return a status code for which SUCCEEDED(status) equals <b>FALSE</b>.   HRESULT error codes are defined in Winerror.h.

## Remarks

A driver registers the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-ipnpcallback.md">IPnpCallback</a> interface when it calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558899">IWDFDriver::CreateDevice</a> method to create a device object.
