# OnRemoteInterfaceEvent method
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

A UMDF-based driver's <b>OnRemoteInterfaceEvent</b> event callback function handles device events that are associated with a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/using-device-interfaces-in-umdf-drivers">device interface</a>.

## Syntax

````
void OnRemoteInterfaceEvent(
  [in]           IWDFRemoteInterface *pWdfRemoteInterface,
  [in]           REFGUID             EventGuid,
  [in, optional] BYTE                *pbData,
  [in]           DWORD               cbDataSize,
  [in]           DWORD               NameBufferOffset
);
````

## Parameters

`pWdfRemoteInterface`

A pointer to the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdfremoteinterface.md">IWDFRemoteInterface</a> interface of a remote interface object that represents a device interface. The driver obtains this pointer when it calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556925">IWDFDevice2::CreateRemoteInterface</a>.

`EventGuid`

A GUID that identifies the event type. Event GUIDs are defined by the components that support such GUIDs. Some <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/C989D2D3-E8DE-4D64-86EE-3D3B3906390D">device interface classes</a> provide event GUIDs, and some driver provide custom events.

`pbData`

A pointer to a buffer that contains event-specific data. Typically, components that define event GUIDs also define event-specific structures for event buffers.

`cbDataSize`

The size, in bytes, of the buffer that <i>pbData</i> points to.

`NameBufferOffset`

An offset, in bytes, from the beginning of the buffer that <i>pbData</i> points to. Bytes from 0 to <i>NameBufferOffset</i>-1 of the buffer contain binary data. Bytes from <i>NameBufferOffset</i> to the end of the buffer contain Unicode string data.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

A driver's <b>OnRemoteInterfaceEvent</b> event callback function handles all device events except arrival and removal events. Such events can originate from a UMDF-based driver's call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558835">IWDFDevice::PostEvent</a> or from a kernel-mode driver's call to <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-ioreporttargetdevicechange.md">IoReportTargetDeviceChange</a> or <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-ioreporttargetdevicechangeasynchronous.md">IoReportTargetDeviceChangeAsynchronous</a>.

The framework begins calling the <b>OnRemoteInterfaceEvent</b> event callback function after the driver calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560276">IWDFRemoteTarget::OpenRemoteInterface</a> and continues to call the callback function until the device interface's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/general-i-o-targets-in-umdf">remote I/O target</a> is closed.

For more information about a driver's <b>OnRemoteInterfaceEvent</b> event callback function, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/using-device-interfaces-in-umdf-drivers">Using Device Interfaces in UMDF-based Drivers</a>.
