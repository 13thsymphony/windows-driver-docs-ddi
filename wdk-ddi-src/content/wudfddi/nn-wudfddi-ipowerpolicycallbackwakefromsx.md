# IPowerPolicyCallbackWakeFromSx interface

<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

A driver's <b>IPowerPolicyCallbackWakeFromSx</b> interface provides callback functions that the framework calls to notify the driver about wake events. These events are related to a device's ability to wake both itself and the system from a low-power state.

## Methods

<p>The <b>IPowerPolicyCallbackWakeFromSx</b> interface has these methods.</p>

| Method | Description |
| ---- |:---- |
| [wudfddi.IPowerPolicyCallbackWakeFromSx.OnArmWakeFromSx](nf-wudfddi-ipowerpolicycallbackwakefromsx-onarmwakefromsx.md) | A driver's OnArmWakeFromSx event callback function arms (that is, enables) a device so that it can trigger a wake signal while in a low-power device state. |
| [wudfddi.IPowerPolicyCallbackWakeFromSx.OnDisarmWakeFromSx](nf-wudfddi-ipowerpolicycallbackwakefromsx-ondisarmwakefromsx.md) | A driver's OnDisarmWakeFromSx event callback function disarms (that is, disables) a device's ability to trigger a wake signal while the device and system are in low-power states. |
| [wudfddi.IPowerPolicyCallbackWakeFromSx.OnWakeFromSxTriggered](nf-wudfddi-ipowerpolicycallbackwakefromsx-onwakefromsxtriggered.md) | A driver's OnWakeFromSxTriggered event callback function informs the driver that its device, which had previously entered a low-power device state because system power was reduced, might have triggered a wake signal. |

## Remarks

If your driver supports an <b>IPowerPolicyCallbackWakeFromSx</b> interface for a device, the <b>IUnknown::QueryInterface</b> method that the driver passes to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558899">IWDFDriver::CreateDevice</a> must return the interface.

## Requirements
