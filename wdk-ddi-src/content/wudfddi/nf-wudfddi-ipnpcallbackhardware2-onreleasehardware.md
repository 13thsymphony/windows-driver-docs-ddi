# OnReleaseHardware method
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>OnReleaseHardware</b> method performs operations that are needed when a device is no longer accessible.

## Syntax

````
HRESULT OnReleaseHardware(
  [in] IWDFDevice3        *pWdfDevice,
  [in] IWDFCmResourceList *pWdfResourcesTranslated
);
````

## Parameters

`pWdfDevice`

A pointer to the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdfdevice3.md">IWDFDevice3</a> interface for the framework device object.

`pWdfResourcesTranslated`

A pointer to the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdfcmresourcelist.md">IWDFCmResourceList</a> interface for the framework resource-list object that identifies the translated hardware resources that the Plug and Play manager has assigned to the device.


## Return Value

<b>OnReleaseHardware</b> returns S_OK if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this method returns one of the error codes that are defined in Winerror.h. Do not return HRESULT_FROM_NT(STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED).

## Remarks

A driver registers the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-ipnpcallbackhardware2.md">IPnpCallbackHardware2</a> interface when the driver calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558899">IWDFDriver::CreateDevice</a> method to create a device object.

 
The <b>OnReleaseHardware</b> method must free resources that were allocated during the call to the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/830D706A-016C-4637-829F-2014AD1A1309">IPnpCallbackHardware2::OnPrepareHardware</a> method, regardless of whether <b>OnPrepareHardware</b> succeeded or failed. As such, <b>OnReleaseHardware</b> must be able to handle the cleanup of partial resources.

For information about deleting an interrupt object, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/B72DA452-B22F-47CD-8C5D-E741F09F556E">Deleting an Interrupt Object</a>.

For information about parsing hardware resources, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/finding-and-mapping-hardware-resources-in-umdf-1-x-drivers">Finding and Mapping Hardware Resources in a UMDF Driver</a>.
