# IWDFCmResourceList interface

<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

This interface represents a list of hardware resources for a device.

## Methods

<p>The <b>IWDFCmResourceList</b> interface has these methods.</p>

| Method | Description |
| ---- |:---- |
| [wudfddi.IWDFCmResourceList.GetCount](nf-wudfddi-iwdfcmresourcelist-getcount.md) | The GetCount method returns the number of resource descriptors that are contained in this interface's resource list. |
| [wudfddi.IWDFCmResourceList.GetDescriptor](nf-wudfddi-iwdfcmresourcelist-getdescriptor.md) | The GetDescriptor method returns a pointer to a resource descriptor that is contained in this interface's resource list. |

## Remarks

After a UMDF driver receives a translated resource list in its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439734">OnPrepareHardware</a> callback, it can use <b>IWDFCmResourceList</b> to scan through the list and identify its port and register resources.

## Requirements

| ---- |:---- |
| **End of support** | Unavailable in UMDF 2.0 and later.  |
| **Target Platform** | Desktop |
| **Minimum UMDF version** | 1.11 |
