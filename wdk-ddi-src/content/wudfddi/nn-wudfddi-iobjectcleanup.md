# IObjectCleanup interface

<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

Any driver that stores a reference-counted COM interface to a WDF object must support the <b>IObjectCleanup</b> interface to prevent interface leakage. Note that drivers, in general, are not required to hold references to WDF objects.

## Methods

<p>The <b>IObjectCleanup</b> interface has these methods.</p>

| Method | Description |
| ---- |:---- |
| [wudfddi.IObjectCleanup.OnCleanup](nf-wudfddi-iobjectcleanup-oncleanup.md) | The OnCleanup method releases any references to a WDF object to prevent interface leakage. |

## Remarks

The framework calls the method of the <b>IObjectCleanup</b> interface when the associated framework object is about to be released.

A driver can register the <b>IObjectCleanup</b> interface when the driver calls any method that creates a WDF object. </p>

## Requirements

| **Windows Driver kit version** |  |
