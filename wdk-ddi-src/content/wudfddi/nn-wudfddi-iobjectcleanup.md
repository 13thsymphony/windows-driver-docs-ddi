# IObjectCleanup interface



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

Any driver that stores a reference-counted COM interface to a WDF object must support the <b>IObjectCleanup</b> interface to prevent interface leakage. Note that drivers, in general, are not required to hold references to WDF objects.



## -inheritance
The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IObjectCleanup</b> interface inherits from the <a href="com.iunknown" xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n"><b>IUnknown</b></a> interface. <b>IObjectCleanup</b> also has these types of members:

The <b>IObjectCleanup</b> interface has these methods.

The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6b66c496-d1cc-4b7a-ae50-f18fffa7275a">OnCleanup</a> method releases any references to a WDF object to prevent interface leakage.

 


## -members
The <b>IObjectCleanup</b> interface has these methods.

## -remarks
The framework calls the method of the <b>IObjectCleanup</b> interface when the associated framework object is about to be released.

A driver can register the <b>IObjectCleanup</b> interface when the driver calls any method that creates a WDF object.
