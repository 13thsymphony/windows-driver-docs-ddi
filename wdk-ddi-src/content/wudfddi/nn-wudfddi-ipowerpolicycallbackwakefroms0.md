# IPowerPolicyCallbackWakeFromS0 interface

<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

A driver's <b>IPowerPolicyCallbackWakeFromS0</b> interface provides callback functions that the framework calls to notify the driver about wake events. These events are related to a device's ability to wake from a low-power state while the system remains in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/93ab0943-a4cc-4ef0-a250-1c63b2c915d5">system working state</a> (S0).

## Methods

<p>The <b>IPowerPolicyCallbackWakeFromS0</b> interface has these methods.</p>

| Method | Description |
| ---- |:---- |
| [IPowerPolicyCallbackWakeFromS0::OnArmWakeFromS0](nf-wudfddi-ipowerpolicycallbackwakefroms0-onarmwakefroms0.md) | A driver's OnArmWakeFromS0 callback function arms (that is, enables) a device so that it can trigger a wake signal while in a low-power device state, if the system remains in the system working state (S0). |
| [IPowerPolicyCallbackWakeFromS0::OnDisarmWakeFromS0](nf-wudfddi-ipowerpolicycallbackwakefroms0-ondisarmwakefroms0.md) | A driver's OnDisarmWakeFromS0 event callback function disarms (that is, disables) a device's ability to trigger a wake signal while in a low-power device state, if the system remains in the system working state (S0). |
| [IPowerPolicyCallbackWakeFromS0::OnWakeFromS0Triggered](nf-wudfddi-ipowerpolicycallbackwakefroms0-onwakefroms0triggered.md) | A driver's OnWakeFromS0Triggered event callback function informs the driver that its device, which had previously entered a low-power device state while the system power state remained at S0, might have triggered a wake signal. |

## Remarks

If your driver supports an <b>IPowerPolicyCallbackWakeFromS0</b> interface for a device, the <b>IUnknown::QueryInterface</b> method that the driver passes to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558899">IWDFDriver::CreateDevice</a> must return the interface.

## Requirements
