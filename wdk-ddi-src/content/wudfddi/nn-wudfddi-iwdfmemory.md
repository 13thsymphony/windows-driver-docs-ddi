# IWDFMemory interface

<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>IWDFMemory</b> interface exposes the framework memory object that provides access to a memory block.

## Methods

<p>The <b>IWDFMemory</b> interface has these methods.</p>

| Method | Description |
| ---- |:---- |
| [IWDFMemory::CopyFromBuffer](nf-wudfddi-iwdfmemory-copyfrombuffer.md) | The CopyFromBuffer method safely copies data from the specified source buffer to a memory object. |
| [IWDFMemory::CopyFromMemory](nf-wudfddi-iwdfmemory-copyfrommemory.md) | The CopyFromMemory method safely copies data from the specified source buffer and prevents overruns that the copy operation might otherwise cause. |
| [IWDFMemory::CopyToBuffer](nf-wudfddi-iwdfmemory-copytobuffer.md) | The CopyToBuffer method safely copies data from a memory object to the specified target buffer. |
| [IWDFMemory::GetDataBuffer](nf-wudfddi-iwdfmemory-getdatabuffer.md) | The GetDataBuffer method retrieves the data buffer that is associated with a memory object. |
| [IWDFMemory::GetSize](nf-wudfddi-iwdfmemory-getsize.md) | The GetSize method retrieves the size of the data buffer that is associated with a memory object. |
| [IWDFMemory::SetBuffer](nf-wudfddi-iwdfmemory-setbuffer.md) | The SetBuffer method assigns a specified buffer to a memory object that a driver created by calling IWDFDriver::CreatePreallocatedWdfMemory. |
