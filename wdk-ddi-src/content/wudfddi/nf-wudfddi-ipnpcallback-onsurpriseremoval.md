# OnSurpriseRemoval method
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>OnSurpriseRemoval</b> method notifies a driver after a device is removed from a computer unexpectedly so that the driver can perform necessary operations.

## Syntax

````
void OnSurpriseRemoval(
  [in] IWDFDevice *pWdfDevice
);
````

## Parameters

`pWdfDevice`

A pointer to the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdfdevice.md">IWDFDevice</a> interface for the device object of the device that is removed unexpectedly.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

A driver registers the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-ipnpcallback.md">IPnpCallback</a> interface when the driver calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558899">IWDFDriver::CreateDevice</a> method to create a device object. 

The framework does not synchronize the <b>OnSurpriseRemoval</b> callback function with other PnP and power management callback functions.  

For more information about when the framework calls this callback function, and for more information about synchronization issues, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/a-user-unplugs-a-device">A User Unplugs a Device</a>.
