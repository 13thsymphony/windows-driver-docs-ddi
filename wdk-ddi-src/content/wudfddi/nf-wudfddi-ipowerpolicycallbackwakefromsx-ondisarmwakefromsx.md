# OnDisarmWakeFromSx method
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

A driver's <b>OnDisarmWakeFromSx</b> event callback function disarms (that is, disables) a device's ability to trigger a wake signal while the device and system are in low-power states.

## Syntax

````
void OnDisarmWakeFromSx(
  [in] IWDFDevice *pWdfDevice
);
````

## Parameters

`pWdfDevice`

A pointer to the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdfdevice.md">IWDFDevice</a> interface of the device object that represents one of the driver's devices.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

Your driver must provide an <b>OnDisarmWakeFromSx</b> callback function if the driver supports the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-ipowerpolicycallbackwakefromsx.md">IPowerPolicyCallbackWakeFromSx</a> interface. 

If the driver has registered this callback function, the framework calls it after the framework has determined that system power is being restored, and after the bus driver completes the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ed582644-af51-4841-be59-6a3deb6d9de5">wait/wake IRP</a>. Before calling the driver's <b>OnDisarmWakeFromSx</b> callback function, the framework calls the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556799">IPnpCallback::OnD0Entry</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556833">IPowerPolicyCallbackWakeFromSx::OnWakeFromSxTriggered</a> callback functions.

The <b>OnDisarmWakeFromSx</b> callback function must perform any hardware operations that are needed to disable the device's ability to trigger a wake signal after the power has been lowered.

For more information about when the framework calls this callback function, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ca36eee5-482c-4cfe-a515-be9d3743e241">PnP and Power Management Scenarios in UMDF</a>.

For more information about this callback function, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/supporting-system-wake-up-in-umdf-drivers">Supporting System Wake-Up in UMDF-based Drivers</a>.
