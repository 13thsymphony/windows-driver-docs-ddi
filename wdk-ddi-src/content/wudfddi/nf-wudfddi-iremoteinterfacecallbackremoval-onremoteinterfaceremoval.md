# OnRemoteInterfaceRemoval method
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

A UMDF-based driver's <b>OnRemoteInterfaceRemoval</b> event callback function notifies the driver that it cannot use a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/using-device-interfaces-in-umdf-drivers">device interface</a> because the interface has been removed.

## Syntax

````
void OnRemoteInterfaceRemoval(
  [in] IWDFRemoteInterface *pWdfRemoteInterface
);
````

## Parameters

`pWdfRemoteInterface`

A pointer to the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdfremoteinterface.md">IWDFRemoteInterface</a> interface of a remote interface object that represents a device interface. The driver obtains this pointer when it calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556925">IWDFDevice2::CreateRemoteInterface</a>.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

A driver's <b>OnRemoteInterfaceRemoval</b> event callback function must do whatever driver-specific tasks are necessary to handle removal of the device interface. In addition, the callback must delete the remote interface object that <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556925">IWDFDevice2::CreateRemoteInterface</a> created and call the interface's <b>Release</b> function if it has previously called the interface's <b>AddRef</b> function.

If the driver does not provide this callback function, the framework deletes the remote interface object that <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556925">IWDFDevice2::CreateRemoteInterface</a> created. 

For more information about a driver's <b>OnRemoteInterfaceRemoval</b> event callback function, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/using-device-interfaces-in-umdf-drivers">Using Device Interfaces in UMDF-based Drivers</a>.
