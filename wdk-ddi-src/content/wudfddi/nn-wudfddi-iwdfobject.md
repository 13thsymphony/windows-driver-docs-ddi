# IWDFObject interface

<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>IWDFObject</b> interface exposes the framework base object that provides the basic functionality common across all framework object types. All framework objects are derived from this root object.

## Methods

<p>The <b>IWDFObject</b> interface has these methods.</p>

| Method | Description |
| ---- |:---- |
| [IWDFObject::AcquireLock](nf-wudfddi-iwdfobject-acquirelock.md) | The AcquireLock method prevents the framework from calling methods of interfaces that a driver registered. |
| [IWDFObject::AssignContext](nf-wudfddi-iwdfobject-assigncontext.md) | The AssignContext method registers a context and a driver-supplied cleanup callback function for the object. |
| [IWDFObject::DeleteWdfObject](nf-wudfddi-iwdfobject-deletewdfobject.md) | The DeleteWdfObject method deletes a previously created Microsoft Windows Driver Frameworks (WDF) object. |
| [IWDFObject::ReleaseLock](nf-wudfddi-iwdfobject-releaselock.md) | The ReleaseLock method allows the framework to call methods of interfaces that are registered by the driver that the framework previously prevented from calling because the driver called the IWDFObject::AcquireLock method. |
| [IWDFObject::RetrieveContext](nf-wudfddi-iwdfobject-retrievecontext.md) | The RetrieveContext method retrieves a context that was previously registered through the IWDFObject::AssignContext method. |


## Requirements
