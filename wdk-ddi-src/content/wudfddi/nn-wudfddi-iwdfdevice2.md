# IWDFDevice2 interface

<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

Drivers obtain the <b>IWDFDevice2</b> interface by calling <b>IWDFDevice::QueryInterface</b>.

## Methods

<p>The <b>IWDFDevice2</b> interface has these methods.</p>

| Method | Description |
| ---- |:---- |
| [IWDFDevice2::AssignS0IdleSettings](nf-wudfddi-iwdfdevice2-assigns0idlesettings.md) | The AssignS0IdleSettings method provides driver-supplied information that the framework uses when a device is idle and the system is in its working (S0) state. |
| [IWDFDevice2::AssignSxWakeSettings](nf-wudfddi-iwdfdevice2-assignsxwakesettings.md) | The AssignSxWakeSettings method provides driver-supplied information about a device's ability to trigger a wake signal while both the device and the system are in a low-power state. |
| [IWDFDevice2::CreateRemoteInterface](nf-wudfddi-iwdfdevice2-createremoteinterface.md) | The CreateRemoteInterface method creates a remote interface object that represents a device interface. |
| [IWDFDevice2::CreateRemoteTarget](nf-wudfddi-iwdfdevice2-createremotetarget.md) | The CreateRemoteTarget method creates a remote target object that represents a remote I/O target. |
| [IWDFDevice2::CreateSymbolicLinkWithReferenceString](nf-wudfddi-iwdfdevice2-createsymboliclinkwithreferencestring.md) | TheCreateSymbolicLinkWithReferenceString method creates a symbolic link name, and optionally, a reference string, for a device. |
| [IWDFDevice2::GetDeviceStackIoTypePreference](nf-wudfddi-iwdfdevice2-getdevicestackiotypepreference.md) | The GetDeviceStackIoTypePreference method retrieves the buffer access methods that the framework is using for a device. |
| [IWDFDevice2::GetSystemPowerAction](nf-wudfddi-iwdfdevice2-getsystempoweraction.md) | The GetSystemPowerAction method returns the system power action, if any, that is currently occurring for the computer. |
| [IWDFDevice2::RegisterRemoteInterfaceNotification](nf-wudfddi-iwdfdevice2-registerremoteinterfacenotification.md) | The RegisterRemoteInterfaceNotification method registers a driver to receive a notification when a specified device interface becomes available. |
| [IWDFDevice2::ResumeIdle](nf-wudfddi-iwdfdevice2-resumeidle.md) | The ResumeIdle method informs the framework that the device is not in use and can be placed in a device low-power state if it remains idle. |
| [IWDFDevice2::StopIdle](nf-wudfddi-iwdfdevice2-stopidle.md) | The StopIdle method informs the framework that the device must be placed in its working (D0) power state. |
