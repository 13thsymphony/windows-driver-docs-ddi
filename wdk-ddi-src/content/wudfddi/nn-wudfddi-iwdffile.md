# IWDFFile interface

<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdffilehandletargetfactory.md">IWDFFile</a> interface exposes the file object that represents the HANDLE that is returned by the Microsoft Win32 <b>CreateFile</b> function. All further operations on this handle, such as calls to the Win32 <b>ReadFile</b> function and the <b>DeviceIoControl</b> function, are sent to this file object.

## Methods

<p>The <b>IWDFFile</b> interface has these methods.</p>

| Method | Description |
| ---- |:---- |
| [wudfddi.IWDFFile.GetDevice](nf-wudfddi-iwdffile-getdevice.md) | The GetDevice method returns the interface to the device object that a file object is associated with. |
| [wudfddi.IWDFFile.RetrieveFileName](nf-wudfddi-iwdffile-retrievefilename.md) | The RetrieveFileName method retrieves the full name of the file that is associated with the underlying kernel-mode device. |
