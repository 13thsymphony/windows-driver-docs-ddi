# RetrieveDeviceName method
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>RetrieveDeviceName</b> method retrieves the name of an underlying kernel-mode device.

## Syntax

````
HRESULT RetrieveDeviceName(
  [out]     PWSTR pDeviceName,
  [in, out] DWORD *pdwDeviceNameLength
);
````

## Parameters

`pDeviceName`

A pointer to a buffer that receives a <b>NULL</b>-terminated string that represents the name of the underlying kernel-mode device, if the buffer is non-<b>NULL</b> and <b>RetrieveDeviceName</b> is successful.

`pdwDeviceNameLength`

A pointer to a variable that receives the number of characters, including the <b>NULL</b> character, in the device name.

If the buffer at <i>pDeviceName</i> is <b>NULL</b>, the value that the driver supplies is zero. The framework then returns the size, in characters, that is required for the device name string.

If the buffer at <i>pDeviceName</i> is non-<b>NULL</b>, the framework returns the size, in characters, of the device name string.


## Return Value

<b>RetrieveDeviceName</b> returns S_OK for the following scenarios: 


<ul>
<li>The buffer that the <i>pDeviceName</i> parameter pointed to was non-<b>NULL</b> and large enough to hold the name string, including the <b>NULL</b> character, and the framework successfully copied the string into the supplied buffer and set the variable that is pointed to by <i>pdwDeviceNameLength</i> to the number of characters in the string.</li>
<li>The buffer at <i>pDeviceName</i> was <b>NULL</b>, the driver preset the variable at <i>pdwDeviceNameLength</i> to 0, and the framework set the variable at <i>pdwDeviceNameLength</i> to the number of characters that were required for the string.</li>
</ul>


<b>RetrieveDeviceName</b> returns HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER) to indicate that the supplied buffer was non-<b>NULL</b> and did not contain enough space to hold the device name. The framework sets the variable at <i>pdwDeviceNameLength</i> to the number of characters that are required for the string.

<b>RetrieveDeviceName</b> might also return other HRESULT values.

## Remarks

The device name is not the physical device object (PDO) name. Instead, the device name is the name of the reflector. The driver must target all I/O to this device object.
