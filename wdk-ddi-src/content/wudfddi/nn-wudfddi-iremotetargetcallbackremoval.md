# IRemoteTargetCallbackRemoval interface



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>IRemoteTargetCallbackRemoval</b> interface provides callback functions that the framework calls to notify the driver about events that are associated with the removal of a <a href="wdf.general_i_o_targets_in_umdf">remote I/O target</a>.



## -inheritance
The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IRemoteTargetCallbackRemoval</b> interface inherits from the <a href="com.iunknown" xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n"><b>IUnknown</b></a> interface. <b>IRemoteTargetCallbackRemoval</b> also has these types of members:

The <b>IRemoteTargetCallbackRemoval</b> interface has these methods.

A UMDF-based driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/10a9510a-a11c-46fa-adb8-b122f6c571f4">OnRemoteTargetQueryRemove</a> event callback function determines whether a remote I/O target's device can be stopped and removed.

A UMDF-based driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/26a6e9e7-f1bb-4174-a640-f665cecfd191">OnRemoteTargetRemoveCanceled</a> event callback function performs operations that are necessary when the operating system cancels the removal of a remote I/O target's device.

A UMDF-based driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/bfac8f91-2367-4194-8e98-e274025c049a">OnRemoteTargetRemoveComplete</a> event callback function performs operations that are necessary after the operating system completes the removal of a remote I/O target's device.

## -remarks
If your driver supports an <b>IRemoteTargetCallbackRemoval</b> interface for a device, the <b>IUnknown::QueryInterface</b> method that the driver passes to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556928">IWDFDevice2::CreateRemoteTarget</a> must return the interface.
