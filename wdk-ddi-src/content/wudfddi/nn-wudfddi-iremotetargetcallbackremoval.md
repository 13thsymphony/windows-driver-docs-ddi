# IRemoteTargetCallbackRemoval interface

<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>IRemoteTargetCallbackRemoval</b> interface provides callback functions that the framework calls to notify the driver about events that are associated with the removal of a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/general-i-o-targets-in-umdf">remote I/O target</a>.

## Methods

<p>The <b>IRemoteTargetCallbackRemoval</b> interface has these methods.</p>

| Method | Description |
| ---- |:---- |
| [wudfddi.IRemoteTargetCallbackRemoval.OnRemoteTargetQueryRemove](nf-wudfddi-iremotetargetcallbackremoval-onremotetargetqueryremove.md) | A UMDF-based driver's OnRemoteTargetQueryRemove event callback function determines whether a remote I/O target's device can be stopped and removed. |
| [wudfddi.IRemoteTargetCallbackRemoval.OnRemoteTargetRemoveCanceled](nf-wudfddi-iremotetargetcallbackremoval-onremotetargetremovecanceled.md) | A UMDF-based driver's OnRemoteTargetRemoveCanceled event callback function performs operations that are necessary when the operating system cancels the removal of a remote I/O target's device. |
| [wudfddi.IRemoteTargetCallbackRemoval.OnRemoteTargetRemoveComplete](nf-wudfddi-iremotetargetcallbackremoval-onremotetargetremovecomplete.md) | A UMDF-based driver's OnRemoteTargetRemoveComplete event callback function performs operations that are necessary after the operating system completes the removal of a remote I/O target's device. |

## Remarks

If your driver supports an <b>IRemoteTargetCallbackRemoval</b> interface for a device, the <b>IUnknown::QueryInterface</b> method that the driver passes to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556928">IWDFDevice2::CreateRemoteTarget</a> must return the interface.
