# IWDFDevice2::RegisterRemoteInterfaceNotification method



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>RegisterRemoteInterfaceNotification</b> method registers a driver to receive a notification when a specified <a href="wdf.using_device_interfaces_in_umdf_drivers">device interface</a> becomes available.



## -syntax

````
HRESULT RegisterRemoteInterfaceNotification(
  [in] LPCGUID pDeviceInterfaceGuid,
  [in] BOOL    IncludeExistingInterfaces
);
````


## -parameters

### -param pDeviceInterfaceGuid [in]

A pointer to a GUID that identifies a device interface.


### -param IncludeExistingInterfaces [in]

A Boolean value. If the driver sets this value to <b>TRUE</b>, the framework notifies the driver if the specified device interface becomes available after the driver calls <b>RegisterRemoteInterfaceNotification</b>, and it also notifies the driver if the device interface was available before the driver called <b>RegisterRemoteInterfaceNotification</b>. 

If the driver sets this value to <b>FALSE</b>, the framework notifies the driver only if the device interface becomes available after the driver calls <b>RegisterRemoteInterfaceNotification</b>.


## -returns
<b>RegisterRemoteInterfaceNotification</b> returns S_OK of the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this method returns another value that Winerror.h contains.


## -remarks
Your driver can call <b>RegisterRemoteInterfaceNotification</b> only if the callback interface that the driver previously passed to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558899">IWDFDriver::CreateDevice</a> supports the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-ipnpcallbackremoteinterfacenotification.md">IPnpCallbackRemoteInterfaceNotification</a> interface.

For more information, see <a href="wdf.using_device_interfaces_in_umdf_drivers">Using Device Interfaces in UMDF-based Drivers</a>.

The following code example shows how an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554896">IDriverEntry::OnDeviceAdd</a> callback function can register for notification of the arrival of a device interface.
