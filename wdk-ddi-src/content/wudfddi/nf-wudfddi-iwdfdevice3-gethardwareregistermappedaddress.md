# GetHardwareRegisterMappedAddress method
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

A driver calls <b>GetHardwareRegisterMappedAddress</b> to get the user-mode mapped address of the memory resource it earlier mapped using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451225">MapIoSpace</a>.

## Syntax

````
PVOID GetHardwareRegisterMappedAddress(
  [in] PVOID *PseudoBaseAddress
);
````

## Parameters

`PseudoBaseAddress`

A pointer to the pseudo base address returned by a previous call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451225">MapIoSpace</a>.


## Return Value

User-mode base address of the resources mapped earlier using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451225">MapIoSpace</a>.

## Remarks

After the driver calls <b>GetHardwareRegisterMappedAddress</b>, it can access the user-mode address directly to read and write to the register.


<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This is not the recommended approach for accessing registers because it prevents UMDF from doing any validation on the access.</div>
<div> </div> For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/A0640E60-B0DF-4CAD-B292-CC1875EF7F7D">Reading and Writing to Device Registers in UMDF 1.x Drivers</a>.

If you do use <b>GetHardwareRegisterMappedAddress</b>, you must set the <b>UmdfRegisterAccessMode</b> INF directive to <b>RegisterAccessUsingUserModeMapping</b>.  For more information about UMDF  INF directives, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/specifying-wdf-directives-in-inf-files">Specifying WDF Directives in INF Files</a>.
