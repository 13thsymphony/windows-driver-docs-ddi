# ForwardToIoQueue method
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>ForwardToIoQueue</b> method forwards (that is, requeues) an I/O request to one of the calling driver's I/O queues.

## Syntax

````
HRESULT ForwardToIoQueue(
  [in] IWDFIoQueue *pDestination
);
````

## Parameters

`pDestination`

A pointer to the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdfioqueue.md">IWDFIoQueue</a> interface for the destination queue object.


## Return Value

<b>ForwardToIoQueue</b> returns S_OK if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this method returns one of the error codes that are defined in Winerror.h.

## Remarks

The driver must own the I/O request and must have obtained the request from one of its I/O queues.

The source and destination queues cannot be the same. In other words, the driver cannot call <b>ForwardToIoQueue</b> to return a request to the queue that it came from. To return an I/O request to the I/O queue that it came from, the driver can call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559028">IWDFIoRequest2::Requeue</a>.

Both the source and destination queues must belong to the same device.

Also, the <b>ForwardToIoQueue</b> method cannot requeue a request that the driver obtained by calling the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558967">IWDFIoQueue::RetrieveNextRequest</a> method.

The request cannot be cancelable. If the driver previously called the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559146">IWDFIoRequest::MarkCancelable</a> method to make the request cancelable, the driver must call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559163">IWDFIoRequest::UnmarkCancelable</a> method before calling <b>ForwardToIoQueue</b>.
