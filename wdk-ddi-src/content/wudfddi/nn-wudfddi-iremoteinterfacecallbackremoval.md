# IRemoteInterfaceCallbackRemoval interface

<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>IRemoteInterfaceCallbackRemoval</b> provides a callback function that the framework calls to notify the driver about the removal of a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/using-device-interfaces-in-umdf-drivers">device interface</a>.

## Methods

<p>The <b>IRemoteInterfaceCallbackRemoval</b> interface has these methods.</p>

| Method | Description |
| ---- |:---- |
| [IRemoteInterfaceCallbackRemoval::OnRemoteInterfaceRemoval](nf-wudfddi-iremoteinterfacecallbackremoval-onremoteinterfaceremoval.md) | A UMDF-based driver's OnRemoteInterfaceRemoval event callback function notifies the driver that it cannot use a device interface because the interface has been removed. |

## Remarks
If your driver supports an <b>IRemoteInterfaceCallbackRemoval</b> interface for a device, the <b>IUnknown::QueryInterface</b> method that the driver passes to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556925">IWDFDevice2::CreateRemoteInterface</a> must return the interface.
