# IWDFIoRequestCompletionParams::GetIoctlParameters method



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>GetIoctlParameters</b> method retrieves parameters that are associated with the completion of a device I/O control request.



## -syntax

````
void GetIoctlParameters(
  [out, optional] ULONG      *pIoControlCode,
  [out, optional] IWDFMemory **ppInputMemory,
  [out, optional] SIZE_T     *pInputMemoryOffset,
  [out, optional] IWDFMemory **ppOutputMemory,
  [out, optional] SIZE_T     *pOutputMemoryOffset,
  [out, optional] SIZE_T     *pOutBytes
);
````


## -parameters

### -param pIoControlCode [out, optional]

A pointer to a variable that receives the control code that identifies the specific operation to be performed. 

This parameter is optional. The driver can pass <b>NULL</b> if the driver does not require the information. 


### -param ppInputMemory [out, optional]

A pointer to a variable that receives a pointer to the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdfmemory.md">IWDFMemory</a> interface for access to the input buffer for the completion of the device I/O control request. 

This parameter is optional. The driver can pass <b>NULL</b> if the driver does not require the information. 


### -param pInputMemoryOffset [out, optional]

A pointer to a variable that receives the offset, in bytes, into the input buffer for the completion of the I/O control request. 

This parameter is optional. The driver can pass <b>NULL</b> if the driver does not require the information. 


### -param ppOutputMemory [out, optional]

A pointer to a variable that receives a pointer to the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdfmemory.md">IWDFMemory</a> interface for access to the output buffer for the completion of the device I/O control request. 

This parameter is optional. The driver can pass <b>NULL</b> if the driver does not require the information. 


### -param pOutputMemoryOffset [out, optional]

A pointer to a variable that receives the offset, in bytes, into the output buffer for the completion of the I/O control request. 

This parameter is optional. The driver can pass <b>NULL</b> if the driver does not require the information. 


### -param pOutBytes [out, optional]

A pointer to a variable that receives the number of bytes that are output for the completion of the device I/O control request.

This parameter is optional. The driver can pass <b>NULL</b> if the driver does not require the information. 


## -returns
