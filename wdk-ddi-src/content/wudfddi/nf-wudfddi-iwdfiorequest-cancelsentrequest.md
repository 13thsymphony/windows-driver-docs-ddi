# IWDFIoRequest::CancelSentRequest method
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>CancelSentRequest</b> method attempts to cancel the I/O request that the driver previously submitted to an I/O target.

## Syntax

```
BOOL CancelSentRequest(

);
```

## Parameters

This function has no parameters.

## Return Value

<b>CancelSentRequest</b> returns a BOOL value that indicates whether the cancel request was successfully delivered to the request's owner. <b>TRUE</b> indicates the request was successfully delivered. <b>FALSE</b> indicates the request was not successfully delivered.

## Remarks

A driver can call <b>CancelSentRequest</b> to attempt to cancel the I/O request that it previously sent to an I/O target by calling the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559149">IWDFIoRequest::Send</a> method.

If the request is in the I/O target's queue, the framework cancels the request. If the framework already delivered the request to the I/O target's driver, and if that driver previously called <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559146">IWDFIoRequest::MarkCancelable</a> to enabling canceling, the framework calls that driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556903">IRequestCallbackCancel::OnCancel</a> method. If the target's driver did not call <b>IWDFIoRequest::MarkCancelable</b>, the request is not canceled unless the request subsequently becomes cancelable.

If the driver previously registered the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556904">IRequestCallbackRequestCompletion</a> interface for the request's completion routine, the framework calls the completion routine after the request is canceled.
