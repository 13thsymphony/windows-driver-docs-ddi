# IWDFObject::RetrieveContext method



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>RetrieveContext</b> method retrieves a context that was previously registered through the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560208">IWDFObject::AssignContext</a> method.



## -syntax

````
HRESULT RetrieveContext(
  [out] void **ppvContext
);
````


## -parameters

### -param ppvContext [out]

A pointer to a buffer that receives a pointer to the previously registered context. 


## -returns
<b>RetrieveContext</b> returns S_OK if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this method returns one of the error codes that are defined in Winerror.h.


## -remarks
Because the context is not a Component Object Model (COM) interface, the driver must not treat the context as such. For example, the driver cannot call the <b>AddRef</b> method on the context.

For a code example of how to use the <b>RetrieveContext</b> method, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558957">IWDFIoQueue::GetDevice</a>.
