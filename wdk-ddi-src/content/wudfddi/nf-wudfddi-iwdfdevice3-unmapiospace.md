# UnmapIoSpace method
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>UnmapIoSpace</b> method unmaps a specified range of physical addresses previously mapped by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451225">MapIoSpace</a> method.

## Syntax

````
VOID UnmapIoSpace(
  [in] PVOID  *PseudoBaseAddress,
  [in] SIZE_T NumberOfBytes
);
````

## Parameters

`PseudoBaseAddress`

Pointer to the pseudo base address obtained from a previous call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451225">MapIoSpace</a> method to which the physical address range was mapped.

`NumberOfBytes`

Specifies the number of bytes that were mapped.


## Return Value

This method does not return a value.

## Remarks

If a driver calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451225">MapIoSpace</a> in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439734">OnPrepareHardware</a> callback. It calls <b>UnmapIoSpace</b> in its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439739">OnReleaseHardware</a> callback.

For an example, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/finding-and-mapping-hardware-resources-in-umdf-1-x-drivers">Finding and Mapping Hardware Resources in a UMDF Driver</a>.
