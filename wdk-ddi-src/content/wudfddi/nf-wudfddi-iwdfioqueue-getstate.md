# GetState method
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>GetState</b> method retrieves the state of an I/O queue.

## Syntax

````
WDF_IO_QUEUE_STATE GetState(
  [out] ULONG *pulNumOfRequestsInQueue,
  [out] ULONG *pulNumOfRequestsInDriver
);
````

## Parameters

`pulNumOfRequestsInQueue`

A pointer to a variable that receives the number of I/O requests that are currently in the I/O queue (that is, that have not been delivered to the driver).

`pulNumOfRequestsInDriver`

A pointer to a variable that receives the number of I/O requests that the driver accepted from the I/O queue but that the driver has not completed, canceled, or forwarded to another I/O queue.


## Return Value

<b>GetState</b> returns a bitwise OR of <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ne-wudfddi_types-_wdf_io_queue_state.md">WDF_IO_QUEUE_STATE</a>-typed values that provides the state of the queue.

## Remarks

The total number of requests that are associated with the I/O queue is the sum of the values that the <i>pulNumOfRequestsInQueue</i> and <i>pulNumOfRequestsInDriver</i> parameters point to.
