# IWDFIoRequest3 interface



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

To obtain the <b>IWDFIoRequest3</b> interface, drivers call <b>IWDFIoRequest::QueryInterface</b>.



## -inheritance
The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IWDFIoRequest3</b> interface inherits from <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdfiorequest2.md">IWDFIoRequest2</a>. <b>IWDFIoRequest3</b> also has these types of members:

The <b>IWDFIoRequest3</b> interface has these methods.


   The 
  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451341">GetUserModeDriverInitiatedIo</a> method determines whether an I/O request is marked as initiated by a UMDF driver.


   The 
  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451345">RetrieveActivityId</a> method retrieves the current activity identifier associated with an I/O request.


   The 
  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451350">SetActivityId</a> method associates an activity identifier with an I/O request.

The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451354">SetUserModeDriverInitiatedIo</a> method 
   
  indicates to kernel-mode drivers that sit below the UMDF driver in the same device stack that a particular request should be treated as though it came from a UMDF driver.
