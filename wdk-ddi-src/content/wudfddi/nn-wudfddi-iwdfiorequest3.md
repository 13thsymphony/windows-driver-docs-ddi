# IWDFIoRequest3 interface

<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

To obtain the <b>IWDFIoRequest3</b> interface, drivers call <b>IWDFIoRequest::QueryInterface</b>.

| [IWDFIoRequest3::GetUserModeDriverInitiatedIo](nf-wudfddi-iwdfiorequest3-getusermodedriverinitiatedio.md) | The GetUserModeDriverInitiatedIo method determines whether an I/O request is marked as initiated by a UMDF driver. |
| [IWDFIoRequest3::RetrieveActivityId](nf-wudfddi-iwdfiorequest3-retrieveactivityid.md) | The RetrieveActivityId method retrieves the current activity identifier associated with an I/O request. |
| [IWDFIoRequest3::SetActivityId](nf-wudfddi-iwdfiorequest3-setactivityid.md) | The SetActivityId method associates an activity identifier with an I/O request. |
| [IWDFIoRequest3::SetUserModeDriverInitiatedIo](nf-wudfddi-iwdfiorequest3-setusermodedriverinitiatedio.md) | The SetUserModeDriverInitiatedIo method indicates to kernel-mode drivers that sit below the UMDF driver in the same device stack that a particular request should be treated as though it came from a UMDF driver. |
