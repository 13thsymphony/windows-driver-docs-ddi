# GetWriteParameters method
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

);
````

## Parameters

`ppWriteMemory`

A pointer to a variable that receives a pointer to the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdfmemory.md">IWDFMemory</a> interface for access to the write buffer for the completion of the write request. 

This parameter is optional. The driver can pass <b>NULL</b> if the driver does not require the information.
