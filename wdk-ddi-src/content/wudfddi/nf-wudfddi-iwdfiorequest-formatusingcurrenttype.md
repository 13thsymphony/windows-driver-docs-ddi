# IWDFIoRequest::FormatUsingCurrentType method



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>FormatUsingCurrentType</b> method formats an I/O request so that the driver can forward it, unmodified, to the next-lower driver.



## -syntax

````
void  FormatUsingCurrentType();
````


## -parameters


## -returns
None

None

None


## -remarks
When a driver receives an I/O request, the driver might forward the request to the local I/O target, unmodified. To forward the unmodified request, the driver must:

Call <b>FormatUsingCurrentType</b> to format the request so that the framework can pass the request to the driver's local I/O target.

Call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559149">IWDFIoRequest::Send</a> method to send the request to the I/O target.

For a code example of how to use the <b>FormatUsingCurrentType</b> method, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559149">IWDFIoRequest::Send</a>.
