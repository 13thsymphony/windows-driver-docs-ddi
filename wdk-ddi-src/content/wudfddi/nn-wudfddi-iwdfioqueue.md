# IWDFIoQueue interface

<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>IWDFIoQueue</b> interface exposes an I/O queue object.

## Methods

<p>The <b>IWDFIoQueue</b> interface has these methods.</p>

| Method | Description |
| ---- |:---- |
| [wudfddi.IWDFIoQueue.ConfigureRequestDispatching](nf-wudfddi-iwdfioqueue-configurerequestdispatching.md) | The ConfigureRequestDispatching method configures the queuing of I/O requests of the given type. |
| [wudfddi.IWDFIoQueue.Drain](nf-wudfddi-iwdfioqueue-drain.md) | The Drain method directs the queue to reject new incoming I/O requests and allow already-queued requests to be delivered to the driver for processing. |
| [wudfddi.IWDFIoQueue.DrainSynchronously](nf-wudfddi-iwdfioqueue-drainsynchronously.md) | The DrainSynchronously method directs the queue to reject new incoming I/O requests and allows already-queued requests to be delivered to the driver for processing. This method returns after all requests are completed or canceled. |
| [wudfddi.IWDFIoQueue.GetDevice](nf-wudfddi-iwdfioqueue-getdevice.md) | The GetDevice method retrieves the interface to the device that owns the I/O queue. |
| [wudfddi.IWDFIoQueue.GetState](nf-wudfddi-iwdfioqueue-getstate.md) | The GetState method retrieves the state of an I/O queue. |
| [wudfddi.IWDFIoQueue.Purge](nf-wudfddi-iwdfioqueue-purge.md) | The Purge method directs the framework to reject new incoming I/O requests and to cancel all outstanding requests. |
| [wudfddi.IWDFIoQueue.PurgeSynchronously](nf-wudfddi-iwdfioqueue-purgesynchronously.md) | The PurgeSynchronously method directs the framework to reject new incoming I/O requests and to cancel all outstanding requests. The method returns after all outstanding requests are canceled. |
| [wudfddi.IWDFIoQueue.RetrieveNextRequest](nf-wudfddi-iwdfioqueue-retrievenextrequest.md) | The RetrieveNextRequest method retrieves the next I/O request from an I/O queue. |
| [wudfddi.IWDFIoQueue.RetrieveNextRequestByFileObject](nf-wudfddi-iwdfioqueue-retrievenextrequestbyfileobject.md) | The RetrieveNextRequestByFileObject method retrieves from an I/O queue the next I/O request whose file object matches the specified file object. |
| [wudfddi.IWDFIoQueue.Start](nf-wudfddi-iwdfioqueue-start.md) | The Start method enables an I/O queue to start receiving new I/O requests and delivering them to a driver. |
| [wudfddi.IWDFIoQueue.Stop](nf-wudfddi-iwdfioqueue-stop.md) | The Stop method prevents an I/O queue from delivering I/O requests, but the queue receives and stores new requests. |
| [wudfddi.IWDFIoQueue.StopSynchronously](nf-wudfddi-iwdfioqueue-stopsynchronously.md) | The StopSynchronously method prevents an I/O queue from delivering I/O requests, but the queue receives and stores new requests. The method returns after all delivered requests have been canceled or completed. |
