# IFileCallbackCleanup interface

<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The framework can notify a driver when the driver should perform a cleanup operation.  The framework notifies the driver in response to an application calling the <b>CloseHandle</b> Microsoft Win32 function. The driver can handle the notification by registering the <b>IFileCallbackCleanup</b> interface.

A driver registers the <b>IFileCallbackCleanup</b> interface when it calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558899">IWDFDriver::CreateDevice</a> method to create a device object.

## Methods

<p>The <b>IFileCallbackCleanup</b> interface has these methods.</p>

| Method | Description |
| ---- |:---- |
| [wudfddi.IFileCallbackCleanup.OnCleanupFile](nf-wudfddi-ifilecallbackcleanup-oncleanupfile.md) | The OnCleanupFile method cancels all I/O requests that a driver has pending in the framework queue. |
