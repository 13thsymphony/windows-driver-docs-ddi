# OnDeviceAdd method
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>OnDeviceAdd</b> method adds a new device to a system.

## Syntax

````
HRESULT OnDeviceAdd(
  [in] IWDFDriver           *pWdfDriver,
  [in] IWDFDeviceInitialize *pWdfDeviceInit
);
````

## Parameters

`pWdfDriver`

A pointer to the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdfdriver.md">IWDFDriver</a> interface for the parent driver object that the new device belongs to.

`pWdfDeviceInit`

A pointer to the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdfdeviceinitialize.md">IWDFDeviceInitialize</a> interface that the driver uses to initialize the newly created device.


## Return Value

<b>OnDeviceAdd</b> returns S_OK if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this method returns one of the error codes that are defined in Winerror.h. The driver should return S_OK only if it successfully called the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558899">IWDFDriver::CreateDevice</a> method to create the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/creating-a-framework-device-object">framework device object</a>. If the driver returns an error code, UMDF tears down the entire device stack regardless of whether the driver is a filter driver or a function driver.

## Remarks

A new device object is created for each device that is loaded in the driver host process. When a new device arrives in the system, the framework calls <b>OnDeviceAdd</b> to notify the driver of the arrival and passes the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdfdriver.md">IWDFDriver</a> and <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdfdeviceinitialize.md">IWDFDeviceInitialize</a> interfaces in the call. The driver can call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556982">IWDFDeviceInitialize::RetrieveDevicePropertyStore</a> method to query for the device information that is provided as part of device installation. The driver must call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558899">IWDFDriver::CreateDevice</a> method to configure and create the device. If the driver does not successfully call <b>IWDFDriver::CreateDevice</b> before it returns S_OK, UMDF determines that the driver's behavior is incorrect and terminates the host process.

Any driver whose <b>OnDeviceAdd</b> method returns S_OK will subsequently receive a call to its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556768">IPnpCallbackHardware::OnReleaseHardware</a> method when the UMDF tears down the device stack.

Do not use the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdfdeviceinitialize.md">IWDFDeviceInitialize</a> interface that the <i>pWdfDeviceInit</i> parameter points to after the driver has called <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff558899">IWDFDriver::CreateDevice</a>.
