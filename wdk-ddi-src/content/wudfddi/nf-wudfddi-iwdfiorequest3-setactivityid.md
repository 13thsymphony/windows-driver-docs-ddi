# IWDFIoRequest3::SetActivityId method



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]


   The 
  <b>SetActivityId</b> method associates an activity identifier with an I/O request.



## -syntax

````
void SetActivityId(
  [in] LPGUID ActivityId
);
````


## -parameters

### -param ActivityId [in]

A pointer to the activity identifier GUID to store in the I/O request.


## -returns
This method does not return a value.


## -remarks
Calling <b>SetActivityId</b> does not set an association with any previously present activity identifier. When the driver calls <b>SetActivityId</b>, any existing activity identifier is overwritten.

To set an association, retrieve the existing identifier by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451345">RetrieveActivityId</a> and then associate the existing identifier with the new one by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/798cf3ba-e1cc-4eaf-a1d2-2313a64aab1a">EventWriteTransfer</a>.

The framework does not clear a request's activity identifier when the driver calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559048">IWdfIoRequest2::Reuse</a>.

For more information about activity identifiers, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2B70953F-5192-4654-9506-6A84373D20B4">Using Activity Identifiers</a>.

The UMDF 2 equivalent of this method is <a href="..\wdfrequest\nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestsetactivityid.md">WdfRequestSetActivityId</a>.

For a code example that uses <b>SetActivityId</b>, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451345">RetrieveActivityId</a>.
