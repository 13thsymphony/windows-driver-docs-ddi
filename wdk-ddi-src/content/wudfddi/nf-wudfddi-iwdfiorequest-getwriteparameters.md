# IWDFIoRequest::GetWriteParameters method



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>GetWriteParameters</b> method retrieves the request parameters for a write-type request.



## -syntax

````
void  GetWriteParameters(
  [out] SIZE_T   *pSizeInBytes,
  [out] LONGLONG *pllOffset,
  [out] ULONG    *pulKey
);
````


## -parameters

### -param pSizeInBytes [out]

A pointer to a variable that receives the size, in bytes, to write. To retrieve the data for writing, the driver calls the <a href="wdf.iwdfiorequest_getinputmemory">IWDFIoRequest::GetInputMemory</a> method.

This parameter is optional. The driver can pass <b>NULL</b> if the driver does not require the information. 


### -param pllOffset [out]

A pointer to a variable that receives the offset, in bytes, to begin writing to the device or the file on the device. If the device does not support absolute write addresses, <i>pllOffset</i> can be ignored. For more information, see the following Remarks section.

Client applications specify this value in the <b>Offset</b> and <b>OffsetHigh</b> members of the OVERLAPPED structure. A pointer to OVERLAPPED is passed in the Microsoft Win32 <b>WriteFile</b> or <b>WriteFileEx</b> function. 

This parameter is optional. The driver can pass <b>NULL</b> if the driver does not require the information. 


### -param pulKey [out]

A pointer to a variable that receives a key that the driver can use to sort the I/O request in a way that the driver determines. 

This parameter is optional. The driver can pass <b>NULL</b> if the driver does not require the information. 


## -returns
None


## -remarks
A call to <b>GetWriteParameters</b> fails if the request type is not a write type.

For devices that support addressing (for example, a disk device), the value that the <i>pllOffset</i> parameter points to is typically the byte offset into the device. For devices that do not support addressing (for example, a serial port), the driver can ignore the value at <i>pllOffset</i>.
