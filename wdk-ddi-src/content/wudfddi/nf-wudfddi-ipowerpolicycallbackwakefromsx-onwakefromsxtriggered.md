# OnWakeFromSxTriggered method
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

A driver's <b>OnWakeFromSxTriggered</b> event callback function informs the driver that its device, which had previously entered a low-power device state because system power was reduced, might have triggered a wake signal.

## Syntax

````
void OnWakeFromSxTriggered(
  [in] IWDFDevice *pWdfDevice
);
````

## Parameters

`pWdfDevice`

A pointer to the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-iwdfdevice.md">IWDFDevice</a> interface of the device object that represents one of the driver's devices.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

Your driver must provide an <b>OnWakeFromSxTriggered</b> callback function if the driver supports the <a href="..\wudfddi\nn-wudfddi-ipowerpolicycallbackwakefromsx.md">IPowerPolicyCallbackWakeFromSx</a> interface. 

If the driver has registered this callback, the framework calls it after calling the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556799">IPnpCallback::OnD0Entry</a> callback function and before calling the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556828">IPowerPolicyCallbackWakeFromSx::OnDisarmWakeFromSx</a> callback function.

System hardware (BIOSes, motherboards, bus adapters) can sometimes drop a wake signal before the bus driver detects it, even though the signal wakes up the system. In such cases, the driver's <b>OnWakeFromSxTriggered</b> callback function will not be called even though the driver's device triggered a wake signal.

For more information about this callback function, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/supporting-system-wake-up-in-umdf-drivers">Supporting System Wake-Up in UMDF-based Drivers</a>.
