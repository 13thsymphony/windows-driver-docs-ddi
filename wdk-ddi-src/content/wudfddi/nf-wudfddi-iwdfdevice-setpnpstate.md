# IWDFDevice::SetPnpState method



## -description
<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>SetPnpState</b> method turns on or off (or sets to the default state) the specified Plug and Play (PnP) property of a device.



## -syntax

````
void SetPnpState(
  [in] WDF_PNP_STATE State,
  [in] WDF_TRI_STATE Value
);
````


## -parameters

### -param State [in]

A <a href="..\wudfddi_types\ne-wudfddi_types-_wdf_pnp_state.md">WDF_PNP_STATE</a>-typed value that identifies the PnP property to set.


### -param Value [in]

A WDF_TRI_STATE-typed value that identifies how to set the PnP property that <i>State</i> specifies. The following table shows the possible values for <i>Value</i>.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<b>WdfUseDefault</b> (0)

</td>
<td>
Set the PnP property to the default state.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<b>WdfFalse</b> (1)

</td>
<td>
Turn off the PnP property.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<b>WdfTrue</b> (2)

</td>
<td>
Turn on the PnP property.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


## -returns
None


## -remarks
Before the state of the PnP property that <b>SetPnpState</b> set can take effect, the driver must call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557010">IWDFDevice::CommitPnpState</a> method.

The following code example shows how to indicate that a device failed as the result of a request.
