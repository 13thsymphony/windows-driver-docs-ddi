# Ntddsd.h header



This header is used by SD. For more information, see
- [SD](../_SD/index.md)

Ntddsd.h contain these programming interfaces:


## Functions

| Title   | Description   |
| ---- |:---- |
| [SdBusOpenInterface function](nf-ntddsd-sdbusopeninterface.md) | The SdBusOpenInterface routine obtains an interface from the Secure Digital (SD) bus driver. |
| [SdBusSubmitRequest function](nf-ntddsd-sdbussubmitrequest.md) | The SdBusSubmitRequest routine sends a synchronous Secure Digital (SD) request to the bus driver. |
| [SdBusSubmitRequestAsync function](nf-ntddsd-sdbussubmitrequestasync.md) | The SdBusSubmitRequestAsync routine sends an asynchronous Secure Digital (SD) request to the bus driver interface. |

## Callback functions

| Title   | Description   |
| ---- |:---- |
| [PSDBUS_ACKNOWLEDGE_INT_ROUTINE callback](nc-ntddsd-psdbus_acknowledge_int_routine.md) | The PSDBUS_ACKNOWLEDGE_INT_ROUTINE prototype declares the routine that a Secure Digital (SD) device driver must call to acknowledge to the bus driver that it has finished processing the interrupt. |
| [PSDBUS_INITIALIZE_INTERFACE_ROUTINE callback](nc-ntddsd-psdbus_initialize_interface_routine.md) | The PSDBUS_INITIALIZE_INTERFACE_ROUTINE prototype declares the routine that a Secure Digital (SD) device driver uses to initialize an interface instance that it creates with the SdBusOpenInterface routine. |
| [SDBUS_CALLBACK_ROUTINE callback](nc-ntddsd-sdbus_callback_routine.md) | The PSDBUS_CALLBACK_ROUTINE prototype declares the Secure Digital (SD) driver callback routine that the SD bus driver uses to report device interrupts to the driver. |
