# _FSRTL_PER_FILE_CONTEXT structure
A legacy file system filter driver can use a <b>FSRTL_PER_FILE_CONTEXT</b> structure to associate driver-specific context information to an open file.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _FSRTL_PER_FILE_CONTEXT {
  LIST_ENTRY     Links;
  PVOID          OwnerId;
  PVOID          InstanceId;
  PFREE_FUNCTION FreeCallback;
} FSRTL_PER_FILE_CONTEXT, *PFSRTL_PER_FILE_CONTEXT;
````

## Members


`FreeCallback`

A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/291b57d9-3bef-4acb-a571-86b67a03cd08">callback routine</a> that frees the per-file context structure. Filter drivers must set this member to a non-<b>NULL</b> value.

`InstanceId`

A pointer to a filter-driver-allocated buffer that can be used to distinguish among the per-file context structures that are created by the same filter driver. The format of this variable is filter-driver-specific. Filter drivers can set this member to <b>NULL</b>.

`Links`

A link for this structure in the list of all per-file context structures that are associated with the same file. <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-fsrtlinsertperfilecontext.md">FsRtlInsertPerFileContext</a> inserts this member into the list of all per-file context structures for a file.

`OwnerId`

A pointer to a filter-driver-allocated buffer that uniquely identifies the owner of the per-file context structure. The format of this variable is filter-driver-specific.  Filter drivers must set this member to a non-<b>NULL</b> value.

## Remarks
In order to associate context information with a file, a legacy filter driver first allocates a <b>FSRTL_PER_FILE_CONTEXT</b> structure and initializes it using <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-fsrtlinsertperfilecontext.md">FsRtlInsertPerFileContext</a>. The driver then uses <b>FsRtlInsertPerFileContext</b> to associate that <b>FSRTL_PER_FILE_CONTEXT</b> object with the file. When the system tears down the file context object for a file, it calls <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-fsrtlteardownperfilecontexts.md">FsRtlTeardownPerFileContexts</a> which calls the <i>FreeCallback</i> routine that is specified in the <b>FSRTL_PER_FILE_CONTEXT</b> object. That callback must free the driver-specific context object.

Filter writers should choose an <b>OwnerID</b> value that is both meaningful and convenient, such as the address of a driver object or device object. 

Filter writers should choose an <b>InstanceID</b> value that is both meaningful and convenient, such as the address of the file context object for the file. Use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546051">FsRtlGetPerFileContextPointer</a> macro to retrieve that address from a file object.

The <b>FSRTL_PER_FILE_CONTEXT</b> structure can be used as-is, or embedded in a driver-defined, per-file context structure.

The <b>FSRTL_PER_FILE_CONTEXT</b> structure can be allocated from paged or nonpaged pool. 

The <b>FsRtlInitPerFileContext</b> macro initializes a <b>FSRTL_PER_FILE_CONTEXT</b> structure.

Parameters

<i>FileContext</i>

<b>FSRTL_PER_FILE_CONTEXT</b>

The FSRTL_PER_FILE_CONTEXT object to be initialized.

<i>OwnerId</i>

<b>PVOID</b>

A pointer to a filter driver-allocated variable that uniquely identifies the owner of the per-file context structure. The format is filter driver-specific. This parameter must have a non-<b>NULL</b> value.

<i>InstanceId</i>

<b>PVOID</b>

A pointer to a filter driver-allocated variable that uniquely identifies the owner of the per-file context structure. The format is filter driver-specific. This parameter must have a non-<b>NULL</b> value.

<i>FreeCallback</i>

<b>PFREE_FUNCTION</b>

A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/291b57d9-3bef-4acb-a571-86b67a03cd08">callback routine</a> that frees the per-file context structure. 

Return value

<b>VOID</b>

None.

This macro must be used before calling <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-fsrtlinsertperfilecontext.md">FsRtlInsertPerFileContext</a>.

Filter writers should choose an <i>OwnerID</i> value that is both meaningful and convenient, such as the address of a driver object or device object. 

Filter writers should use an <i>InstanceID</i> value that is both meaningful and convenient, such as the address of the file context object for the file. Use the <b>FsRtlGetPerFileContextPointer</b> macro to retrieve that address from a file object.
