# IoGetAttachedDevice function
The <b>IoGetAttachedDevice</b> routine returns a pointer to the highest-level device object associated with the specified device.

## Syntax

```
NTKERNELAPI PDEVICE_OBJECT IoGetAttachedDevice(
  PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject
);
```

## Parameters

`DeviceObject`

A pointer to the device object for which the topmost attached device is to be returned.


## Return Value

<b>IoGetAttachedDevice</b> returns the highest-level device attached to the specified device.

## Remarks

If the device object specified by <i>DeviceObject</i> has no other device objects attached to it, <i>DeviceObject</i> and the returned pointer are equal.

<b>IoGetAttachedDevice</b> differs from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549145">IoGetAttachedDeviceReference</a> in the following respects:

<ul>
<li>
<b>IoGetAttachedDevice</b> does not increment the reference count on the device object. (Thus no matching call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557724">ObDereferenceObject</a> is required.)

</li>
<li>
Callers of <b>IoGetAttachedDevice</b> must ensure that no device objects are added to or removed from the stack while <b>IoGetAttachedDevice</b> is executing. Callers that cannot do this must use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549145">IoGetAttachedDeviceReference</a> instead.

</li>
</ul>
