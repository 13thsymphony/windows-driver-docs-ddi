# IoGetAttachedDevice function



## -description
The <b>IoGetAttachedDevice</b> routine returns a pointer to the highest-level device object associated with the specified device.



## -syntax

````
PDEVICE_OBJECT IoGetAttachedDevice(
  _In_ PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject
);
````


## -parameters

### -param DeviceObject [in]

A pointer to the device object for which the topmost attached device is to be returned.


## -returns
<b>IoGetAttachedDevice</b> returns the highest-level device attached to the specified device. 


## -remarks
If the device object specified by <i>DeviceObject</i> has no other device objects attached to it, <i>DeviceObject</i> and the returned pointer are equal.

<b>IoGetAttachedDevice</b> differs from <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iogetattacheddevicereference.md">IoGetAttachedDeviceReference</a> in the following respects:

<b>IoGetAttachedDevice</b> does not increment the reference count on the device object. (Thus no matching call to <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-obdereferenceobject.md">ObDereferenceObject</a> is required.)

Callers of <b>IoGetAttachedDevice</b> must ensure that no device objects are added to or removed from the stack while <b>IoGetAttachedDevice</b> is executing. Callers that cannot do this must use <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iogetattacheddevicereference.md">IoGetAttachedDeviceReference</a> instead.
