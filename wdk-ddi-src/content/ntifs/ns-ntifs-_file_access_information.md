# _FILE_ACCESS_INFORMATION structure
The <b>FILE_ACCESS_INFORMATION</b> structure is used to query for or set the access rights of a file.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _FILE_ACCESS_INFORMATION {
  ACCESS_MASK AccessFlags;
} FILE_ACCESS_INFORMATION, *PFILE_ACCESS_INFORMATION;
````

## Members


`AccessFlags`

Flags that specify a set of access rights in the access mask of an access control entry. This member is a value of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540466">ACCESS_MASK</a>.

## Remarks
This structure is used by the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-zwqueryinformationfile.md">ZwQueryInformationFile</a> routine.

The <i>AccessFlags</i> parameter is an access mask that encodes the user rights to a file object. An access mask can be used to encode the rights to an object that is assigned to a user or a user group, or to encode the requested access when a user opens an object. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540466">ACCESS_MASK</a>.

## Requirements
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows version** | Supported in Windows XP and later versions of Windows. Supported in Windows XP and later versions of Windows. |
| **Header** | ntifs.h (include Ntifs.h, Fltkernel.h) |
