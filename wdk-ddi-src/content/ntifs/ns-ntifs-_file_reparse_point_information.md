# _FILE_REPARSE_POINT_INFORMATION structure



## -description
The FILE_REPARSE_POINT_INFORMATION structure is used to query for information about a reparse point. 



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _FILE_REPARSE_POINT_INFORMATION {
  LONGLONG FileReference;
  ULONG    Tag;
} FILE_REPARSE_POINT_INFORMATION, *PFILE_REPARSE_POINT_INFORMATION;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field FileReference

The 8-byte file reference number for the file. This number is generated and assigned to the file by the NTFS file system. (Note that the <i>FileId</i> is not the same as the 16-byte "file object ID" that was added to NTFS for Microsoft Windows 2000.) 


### -field Tag

Reparse point tag. The <b>ReparseTag</b> member indicates the structure of the user-defined reparse data. For more information about reparse point tags, see the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation. 


## -remarks
This information can be queried in either of the following ways: 

Call <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-zwquerydirectoryfile.md">ZwQueryDirectoryFile</a>, passing FileReparsePointInformation as the value of <i>FileInformationClass</i> and passing a caller-allocated, FILE_REPARSE_POINT_INFORMATION-structured buffer as the value of <i>FileInformation</i>. 

Create an IRP with major function code <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548658">IRP_MJ_DIRECTORY_CONTROL</a> and minor function code IRP_MN_QUERY_DIRECTORY. 

For more information about reparse points, see the Windows SDK documentation. 

No specific access rights are required to query this information. 

This structure must be LONG-aligned.
