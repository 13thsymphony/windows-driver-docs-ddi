# _FSRTL_PER_FILEOBJECT_CONTEXT structure
The opaque <b>FSRTL_PER_FILEOBJECT_CONTEXT </b>structure is used by the operating system to track file system filter-driver-defined context information structures for a file object.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _FSRTL_PER_FILEOBJECT_CONTEXT {
  LIST_ENTRY Links;
  PVOID      OwnerId;
  PVOID      InstanceId;
} FSRTL_PER_FILEOBJECT_CONTEXT, *PFSRTL_PER_FILEOBJECT_CONTEXT;
````

## Members


`InstanceId`

A pointer to a filter-driver-allocated variable that can be used to distinguish among per-file-object context structures created by the same filter driver. The format of this variable is filter-driver-specific. Filter writers should choose a value that is both meaningful and convenient, such as the address of the file object itself. Note that the value of this member can be <b>NULL</b>.

`Links`

Link for this structure in the list of all per-file-object context structures associated with the same file object. <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-fsrtlinsertperfileobjectcontext.md">FsRtlInsertPerFileObjectContext</a> inserts this member into the list of all per-file-object context structures for the file object.

`OwnerId`

A pointer to a filter-driver-allocated variable that uniquely identifies the owning filter of the per-file-object context structure. The format of this variable is filter-driver-specific. Filter writers should choose a value that is both meaningful and convenient, such as the address of the filter's device object or driver object. Note that the value of this member cannot be <b>NULL</b>.

## Remarks
File system filter drivers can use the opaque FSRTL_PER_FILEOBJECT_CONTEXT structure to maintain context information for a file object. This structure can be used as-is or embedded in a driver-defined, per-file-object context structure.

Each file object can have one per-file-object context structure list associated with it. Each member of this list (that is, a particular per-file-object context structure) is owned by a filter driver. From the perspective of a filter driver, each filter driver can associate multiple per-file-object context structures for the same file object.

Each filter-defined per-file-object context structure must include an initialized FSRTL_PER_FILEOBJECT_CONTEXT structure. The FSRTL_PER_FILEOBJECT_CONTEXT structure can be allocated from paged or nonpage pool and must be initialized using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546170">FsRtlInitPerFileObjectContext</a> macro.

To insert a FSRTL_PER_FILEOBJECT_CONTEXT structure or a filter-defined per-file-object context structure (containing an initialized FSRTL_PER_FILEOBJECT_CONTEXT structure) into the list of all context structures for a file object, use the <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-fsrtlinsertperfileobjectcontext.md">FsRtlInsertPerFileObjectContext</a> function.

After a FSRTL_PER_FILEOBJECT_CONTEXT or per-file-object context structure has been associated with a file object, it can be retrieved by calling <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-fsrtllookupperfileobjectcontext.md">FsRtlLookupPerFileObjectContext </a>or removed by calling <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-fsrtlremoveperfileobjectcontext.md">FsRtlRemovePerFileObjectContext </a>(based upon the values of <b>OwnerId</b> and <b>InstanceId</b>).

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  
     File system minifilter drivers must not use the following functions:<ul>
<li>

<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546170">FsRtlInitPerFileObjectContext</a>

The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546170">FsRtlInitPerFileObjectContext</a> macro initializes a <b>FSRTL_PER_FILEOBJECT_CONTEXT</b> structure.

Parameters

<i>PerFileObjectContext [in]</i>

<b>PFSRTL_PER_FILEOBJECT_CONTEXT</b>

A pointer to the FSRTL_PER_FILEOBJECT_CONTEXT structure to be initialized. This structure can be used as-is or embedded in a driver-defined, per-file-object context structure. Both structure types are commonly allocated by calling <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exallocatepoolwithtag.md">ExAllocatePoolWithTag</a>.

<i>OwnerId [in]</i>

<b>PVOID</b>

A pointer to a caller-allocated variable that uniquely identifies the owning filter of the per-file-object context structure. The format of this variable is filter-driver-specific. Filter writers should choose a value that is both meaningful and convenient, such as the address of the filter's device object or driver object. This parameter cannot be <b>NULL</b>.

<i>InstanceId [in]</i>

<b>PVOID</b>

A pointer to a caller-allocated variable that can be used to distinguish among per-file-object context structures created by the same filter driver. The format of this variable is filter-driver-specific. Filter writers should choose a value that is both meaningful and convenient, such as the address of the file object itself. This parameter is optional and can be <b>NULL</b>.

<i>FreeCallback</i>

<b>PFREE_FUNCTION</b>

A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/291b57d9-3bef-4acb-a571-86b67a03cd08">callback routine</a> that frees the per-file context structure. 

Return value

<b>VOID</b>

None.

The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546170">FsRtlInitPerFileObjectContext</a> macro must be used to initialize a <b>FSRTL_PER_FILEOBJECT_CONTEXT</b> structure. For information about how the FSRTL_PER_FILEOBJECT_CONTEXT structure is used in relation to associating filter-defined context information with a file object, see the <b>FSRTL_PER_FILEOBJECT_CONTEXT</b> topic.

To associate a FSRTL_PER_FILEOBJECT_CONTEXT structure or filter-defined per-file-object context structure (containing an initialized FSRTL_PER_FILEOBJECT_CONTEXT structure) with a file object, use the <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-fsrtlinsertperfileobjectcontext.md">FsRtlInsertPerFileObjectContext</a> function.

After a FSRTL_PER_FILEOBJECT_CONTEXT structure or filter-defined per-file-object context structure has been associated with a file object, it can be retrieved by calling <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-fsrtllookupperfileobjectcontext.md">FsRtlLookupPerFileObjectContext</a> or removed by calling <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-fsrtlremoveperfileobjectcontext.md">FsRtlRemovePerFileObjectContext</a>.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  File system minifilter drivers must not use the <b>FsRtl</b><i>Xxx</i> PerFileObjectContext functions. Instead, minifilters can use the <b>Flt</b><i>Xxx</i><b>Context</b> functions to associate context information with a file object. For a complete list, see the <b>FSRTL_PER_FILEOBJECT_CONTEXT</b> topic.</div>
