# FsRtlIsLeadDbcsCharacter macro



## -description
The <b>FsRtlIsLeadDbcsCharacter</b> macro determines whether a character is a lead byte (the first byte of a character) in a double-byte character set (DBCS). 



## -syntax

````
BOOLEAN FsRtlIsLeadDbcsCharacter(
  _In_ UCHAR DbcsCharacter
);
````


## -parameters

### -param DbcsCharacter [in]

The character to be tested.


## -remarks
Lead bytes are unique to double-byte character sets. A lead byte introduces a double-byte character. Lead bytes occupy a specific range of byte values. The <b>FsRtlIsLeadDbcsCharacter</b> macro uses the system code page to check lead-byte ranges.
