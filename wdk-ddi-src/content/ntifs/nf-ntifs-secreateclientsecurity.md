# SeCreateClientSecurity function
The <b>SeCreateClientSecurity</b> routine initializes a security client context structure with the information needed to call <b>SeImpersonateClientEx</b>.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS SeCreateClientSecurity(
  _In_  PETHREAD                     ClientThread,
  _In_  PSECURITY_QUALITY_OF_SERVICE ClientSecurityQos,
  _In_  BOOLEAN                      ServerIsRemote,
  _Out_ PSECURITY_CLIENT_CONTEXT     ClientContext
);
````

## Parameters

`ClientThread`

Pointer to the thread of the client to be impersonated.

`ClientSecurityQos`

Pointer to a caller-allocated SECURITY_QUALITY_OF_SERVICE structure indicating what form of impersonation is to be performed.

`RemoteSession`

TBD

`ClientContext`

Pointer to a caller-allocated SECURITY_CLIENT_CONTEXT structure to be initialized.


## Return Value

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The security client context was successfully initialized.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_BAD_IMPERSONATION_LEVEL</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The client to be impersonated is currently impersonating a client of its own, and one of the following is true:

<ul>
<li>
The client's effective token cannot be passed on for use by another server, because its impersonation level is <b>SecurityAnonymous</b> or <b>SecurityIdentification</b>. 

</li>
<li>
<i>ServerIsRemote</i> is <b>TRUE</b>, and the client thread is impersonating its client at other than <b>SecurityDelegation</b> level.

</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

<b>SeCreateClientSecurity</b> initializes a client security context block to represent a client's security context.

If the <b>ContextTrackingMode</b> member of <i>ClientSecurityQos</i> is set to SECURITY_DYNAMIC_TRACKING and <i>ServerIsRemote</i> is set to <b>FALSE</b>, <b>SeCreateClientSecurity</b> uses a reference to the client's effective token. Otherwise, <b>SeCreateClientSecurity</b> creates a copy of the client's token.

Each call to <b>SeCreateClientSecurity</b> must be matched by a subsequent call to <b>SeDeleteClientSecurity</b>.

For more information about security and access control, see the documentation on these topics in the Microsoft Windows SDK.
