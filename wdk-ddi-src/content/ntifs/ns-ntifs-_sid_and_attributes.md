# _SID_AND_ATTRIBUTES structure
The SID_AND_ATTRIBUTES structure represents a security identifier (SID) and its attributes. SIDs are used to uniquely identify users or groups.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _SID_AND_ATTRIBUTES {
  PSID  Sid;
  ULONG Attributes;
} SID_AND_ATTRIBUTES, *PSID_AND_ATTRIBUTES;
````

## Members


`Attributes`

Specifies attributes of the SID. This value contains up to 32 one-bit flags. Its meaning depends on the definition and use of the SID.

## Remarks
A group is represented by a SID. SIDs have attributes that indicate whether they are currently enabled, disabled, or mandatory, and how they are used. A <b>SID_AND_ATTRIBUTES</b> structure can represent a SID whose attributes change frequently. For example, it is used to represent groups in the <a href="..\ntifs\ns-ntifs-_token_groups.md">TOKEN_GROUPS</a> structure.
