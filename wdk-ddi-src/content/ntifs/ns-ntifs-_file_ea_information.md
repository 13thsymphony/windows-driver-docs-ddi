# _FILE_EA_INFORMATION structure
The <b>FILE_EA_INFORMATION</b> structure is used to query for the size of the extended attributes (EA) for a file.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _FILE_EA_INFORMATION {
  ULONG EaSize;
} FILE_EA_INFORMATION, *PFILE_EA_INFORMATION;
````

## Members

        
            `EaSize`

            Specifies the combined length, in bytes, of the extended attributes for the file.

    ## Remarks
        This structure is used by the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-zwqueryinformationfile.md">ZwQueryInformationFile</a> routine.

An extended attribute is a piece of application-specific metadata that an application can associate with a file that is not part of the file's data. In addition to the built-in attributes of a file, such as creation and modification times, applications can add non-file system attributes, such as the author's name and a description of the file content.

## Requirements
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows Driver kit version** |  |
| **Minimum KMDF version** |  |
| **Minimum UMDF version** |  |
| **Header** | ntifs.h (include Ntifs.h, Fltkernel.h) |
