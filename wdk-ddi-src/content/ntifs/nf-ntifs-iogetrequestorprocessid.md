# IoGetRequestorProcessId function
The <b>IoGetRequestorProcessId</b> routine returns the unique 32-bit process ID for the thread that originally requested a given I/O operation.

## Syntax

````
ULONG IoGetRequestorProcessId(
  _In_ PIRP Irp
);
````

## Parameters

`Irp`

A pointer to the I/O request packet (IRP) for the specified I/O operation.


## Return Value

<b>IoGetRequestorProcessId</b> returns the process ID for the thread that requested the I/O operation. If the IRP is not associated with any thread, <b>IoGetRequestorProcessId</b> returns zero.

## Remarks

On Microsoft Windows XP and later, <b>IoGetRequestorProcessId</b> returns the process ID for the process to which the thread is currently attached. 

On Microsoft Windows 2000 and earlier, <b>IoGetRequestorProcessId</b> returns the process ID for the process that created the thread.
