## -returns
<b>FsRtlNotifyVolumeEvent</b> returns the status of the notification. 


## -remarks
File systems call <b>FsRtlNotifyVolumeEvent</b> to notify any registered user-mode applications that a volume event is occurring. 

PnP event GUID values are defined in Ioevent.h. 

To register for volume event notification, applications must call the Microsoft Win32 <b>RegisterDeviceNotification</b> function. For more information, see the Device Management section in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.
