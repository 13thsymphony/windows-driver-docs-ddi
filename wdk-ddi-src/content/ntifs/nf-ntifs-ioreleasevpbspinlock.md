# IoReleaseVpbSpinLock function
The <b>IoReleaseVpbSpinLock</b> routine releases the Volume Parameter Block (VPB) spin lock.

## Syntax

````
VOID IoReleaseVpbSpinLock(
  _In_ KIRQL Irql
);
````

## Parameters

`Irql`

Saved IRQL value returned by <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-ioacquirevpbspinlock.md">IoAcquireVpbSpinLock</a> when the VPB spin lock was acquired.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

This routine is the reciprocal to <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-ioacquirevpbspinlock.md">IoAcquireVpbSpinLock</a>. Every successful call to <b>IoAcquireVpbSpinLock</b> must be matched by a subsequent call to <b>IoReleaseVpbSpinLock</b>. 

Before using <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-ioacquirevpbspinlock.md">IoAcquireVpbSpinLock</a> and <b>IoReleaseVpbSpinLock</b>, driver writers are strongly encouraged to study the way these routines are used in the FASTFAT sample. 

The holder of the VPB spin lock executes at IRQL DISPATCH_LEVEL after calling <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-ioacquirevpbspinlock.md">IoAcquireVpbSpinLock</a>. <b>IoReleaseVpbSpinLock</b> restores the caller's original IRQL.
