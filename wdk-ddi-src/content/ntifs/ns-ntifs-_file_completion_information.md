# _FILE_COMPLETION_INFORMATION structure
The <b>FILE_COMPLETION_INFORMATION</b> structure contains the port handle and key for an I/O completion port created for a file handle.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _FILE_COMPLETION_INFORMATION {
  HANDLE Port;
  PVOID  Key;
} FILE_COMPLETION_INFORMATION, *PFILE_COMPLETION_INFORMATION;
````

## Members


`Key`

An custom defined value which is included in every I/O completion packet for <b>Port</b>.

`Port`

The handle to the completion port created for an associated file handle.

## Remarks
The <b>FILE_COMPLETION_INFORMATION</b> structure is used to replace the completion information for a port handle set in <b>Port</b>. Completion information is replaced with the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-zwsetinformationfile.md">ZwSetInformationFile</a> routine with the <i>FileInformationClass</i> parameter set to <b>FileReplaceCompletionInformation</b>.   The <b>Port</b> and <b>Key</b> members of <b>FILE_COMPLETION_INFORMATION</b> are set to their new values. To remove an existing completion port for a file handle, <b>Port</b> is set to NULL.

## Requirements
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |

| **Windows version** | This structure is available starting with Windows 8.1. This structure is available starting with Windows 8.1. |
