# _FILE_QUOTA_INFORMATION structure
The FILE_QUOTA_INFORMATION structure is used to query or set per-user quota information for each of the files in a directory.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _FILE_QUOTA_INFORMATION {
  ULONG         NextEntryOffset;
  ULONG         SidLength;
  LARGE_INTEGER ChangeTime;
  LARGE_INTEGER QuotaUsed;
  LARGE_INTEGER QuotaThreshold;
  LARGE_INTEGER QuotaLimit;
  SID           Sid;
} FILE_QUOTA_INFORMATION, *PFILE_QUOTA_INFORMATION;
````

## Members


`ChangeTime`

Time when this quota entry was last changed.

`NextEntryOffset`

Offset, in bytes, of the next quota entry in the list. If there are no more entries after the current one, this member is zero.

`QuotaLimit`

Maximum amount of disk space on this volume that can be used by the user.

`QuotaThreshold`

Maximum mount of disk space on this volume that can be used by the user without triggering an event. For more information, see <a href="..\ntifs\ns-ntifs-_file_fs_control_information.md">FILE_FS_CONTROL_INFORMATION</a>.

`QuotaUsed`

Amount of disk space on this volume that is currently being used by the user.

`Sid`

Security identifier (SID) of the user.

`SidLength`

Length, in bytes, of the <b>Sid</b> member.

## Remarks
No specific access rights are required to query this information. To perform this query, create an IRP with major function code IRP_MJ_QUERY_QUOTA. 

FILE_WRITE_DATA access to the volume is required to set this information. To perform this operation, create an IRP with major function code IRP_MJ_SET_QUOTA. 

To check the validity of a buffer containing FILE_QUOTA_INFORMATION structure, call <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-iocheckquotabuffervalidity.md">IoCheckQuotaBufferValidity</a>. 

On 32-bit platforms, this structure must be aligned on a LONG (4-byte) boundary. If a buffer contains two or more of these structures, the <b>NextEntryOffset</b> value in each entry, except the last, falls on a 4-byte boundary. 

On 64-bit platforms, this structure must be aligned on a LONGLONG (8-byte) boundary. If a buffer contains two or more of these structures, the <b>NextEntryOffset</b> value in each entry, except the last, falls on an 8-byte boundary.
