# FsRtlDissectDbcs function



## -description
Given an ANSI or double-byte character set (DBCS) pathname string, the <b>FsRtlDissectDbcs</b> routine returns two strings: one containing the first file name found in the string, the other containing the remaining unparsed portion of the pathname string.



## -syntax

````
VOID FsRtlDissectDbcs(
  _In_  ANSI_STRING  Path,
  _Out_ PANSI_STRING FirstName,
  _Out_ PANSI_STRING RemainingName
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Path [in]

The pathname string to be parsed.


### -param FirstName [out]

A pointer to the first file name in the pathname string. 


### -param RemainingName [out]

A pointer to the remaining unparsed portion of the pathname string.


## -returns
None


## -remarks
In the input string, backslashes are read as name separators. The first name in the string is assumed to consist of all characters from the beginning of the string to the character preceding the first backslash, inclusive. There is just one exception to this rule: if the first character in the input string is a backslash, this character is ignored and does not appear in the output string. The remaining portion of the string consists of all characters following the backslash that follows the first name found in the string. 

<b>FsRtlDissectDbcs</b> does not check for the presence of illegal characters in the input string.

The following table shows sample input and output values for <b>FsRtlDissectDbcs</b>:

empty

A

A\B\C\D\E

B\C\D\E

*A?

\A

A[,]

A\\B+;\C

\B+;\C

Note that upon returning, the <b>Buffer</b> members of the output parameters will point into the <b>Buffer</b> member of <b>Path</b>.  Therefore, the caller should not allocate storage for the <b>Buffer</b> members of the two output parameters, as shown in the following example:
