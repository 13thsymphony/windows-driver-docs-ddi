# CcSetBcbOwnerPointer function
The <b>CcSetBcbOwnerPointer</b> routine sets the owner thread pointer for a pinned buffer control block (BCB).

## Syntax

````
VOID CcSetBcbOwnerPointer(
  _In_ PVOID Bcb,
  _In_ PVOID OwnerPointer
);
````

## Parameters

`Bcb`

Pointer to a pinned BCB structure that is owned by the current thread.

`OwnerPointer`

A valid resource owner pointer, which means a pointer to an allocated system address, with the low-order two bits set. This address may not be deallocated until after the BCB is unpinned by a subsequent call to <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-ccunpindataforthread.md">CcUnpinDataForThread</a>.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

File systems call <b>CcSetBcbOwnerPointer</b> to set the resource owner for a pinned buffer control block (BCB), in cases where another thread will unpin the BCB and thus the current thread can exit.

Each call to <b>CcSetBcbOwnerPointer</b> must be matched by a subsequent call to <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-ccunpindataforthread.md">CcUnpinDataForThread</a>, which must be called with the same owner pointer.

BCBs that have been modified by <b>CcSetBcbOwnerPointer</b> cannot be unpinned by calling <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-ccunpindata.md">CcUnpinData</a>.
