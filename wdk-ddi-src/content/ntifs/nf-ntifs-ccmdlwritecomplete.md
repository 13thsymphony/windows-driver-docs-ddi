# CcMdlWriteComplete function
The <b>CcMdlWriteComplete</b> routine frees the memory descriptor lists (MDL) created by <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-ccpreparemdlwrite.md">CcPrepareMdlWrite</a> for a cached file.

## Syntax

````
VOID CcMdlWriteComplete(
  _In_ PFILE_OBJECT   FileObject,
  _In_ PLARGE_INTEGER FileOffset,
  _In_ PMDL           MdlChain
);
````

## Parameters

`FileObject`

File object pointer that was passed to <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-ccpreparemdlwrite.md">CcPrepareMdlWrite</a>.

`FileOffset`

Value of <i>FileOffset</i> that was passed to <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-ccpreparemdlwrite.md">CcPrepareMdlWrite</a>.

`MdlChain`

Address of the MDL chain returned by <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-ccpreparemdlwrite.md">CcPrepareMdlWrite</a>.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

File systems call <b>CcMdlWriteComplete</b> to free the memory descriptor lists (MDL) created by <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-ccpreparemdlwrite.md">CcPrepareMdlWrite</a> for a cached file and to mark the specified byte range for write. All physical pages that were locked down are unlocked. Any pages that were mapped are unmapped.

If the FO_WRITE_THROUGH flag is set on the file object pointed to by the <i>FileObject</i> parameter, the file data is immediately flushed to disk. This flush operation re-enters the file system and can cause <b>CcMdlWriteComplete</b> to raise an exception if the flush operation fails. In this case, the MDL has not been freed and the caller may re-try the operation.

After <b>CcMdlWriteComplete</b> is called successfully for an IRP_MN_COMPLETE operation, the caller must set the IRP's <b>MdlAddress</b> field to <b>NULL</b>. 

Before using <b>CcMdlWriteComplete</b>, file system developers are strongly encouraged to study the way this routine is used in the FASTFAT sample. 

Each call to <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-ccpreparemdlwrite.md">CcPrepareMdlWrite</a> must be followed by a call to <b>CcMdlWriteComplete</b> or <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-ccmdlwriteabort.md">CcMdlWriteAbort</a>.
