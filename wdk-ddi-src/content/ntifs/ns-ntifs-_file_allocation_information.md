# _FILE_ALLOCATION_INFORMATION structure
The FILE_ALLOCATION_INFORMATION structure is used to set the allocation size for a file.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _FILE_ALLOCATION_INFORMATION {
  LARGE_INTEGER AllocationSize;
} FILE_ALLOCATION_INFORMATION, *PFILE_ALLOCATION_INFORMATION;
````

## Members


`AllocationSize`

File allocation size, in bytes. Usually this value is a multiple of the sector or cluster size of the underlying physical device.

## Remarks
This operation can be performed in either of the following ways: 

<ul>
<li>
Call <a href="..\fltkernel\nf-fltkernel-fltsetinformationfile.md">FltSetInformationFile</a> or <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-zwsetinformationfile.md">ZwSetInformationFile</a>, passing FileAllocationInformation as the value of <i>FileInformationClass</i> and passing a caller-allocated, FILE_ALLOCATION_INFORMATION-structured buffer as the value of <i>FileInformation</i>. The <i>FileHandle</i> parameter specifies the file whose allocation size is to be set. 

</li>
<li>
Create an IRP with major function code IRP_MJ_SET_INFORMATION. 

</li>
</ul>
This operation is valid only for files. It is undefined for directories. 

File system minifilters must use <a href="..\fltkernel\nf-fltkernel-fltsetinformationfile.md">FltSetInformationFile</a>, not <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-zwsetinformationfile.md">ZwSetInformationFile</a>, to set the allocation size for a file. 

FILE_WRITE_DATA access is required to set this information. 

A file's allocation size and end-of-file position are independent of each other, with the following exception: The end-of-file position must always be less than or equal to the allocation size. If the allocation size is set to a value that is less than the end-of-file position, the end-of-file position is automatically adjusted to match the allocation size. 

The size of the <i>FileInformation</i> buffer passed to <a href="..\fltkernel\nf-fltkernel-fltsetinformationfile.md">FltSetInformationFile</a> or <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-zwsetinformationfile.md">ZwSetInformationFile</a> must be &gt;= <b>sizeof</b>(FILE_ALLOCATION_INFORMATION). 

This structure must be aligned on a LONGLONG (8-byte) boundary.
