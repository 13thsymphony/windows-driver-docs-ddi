# FsRtlMdlWriteCompleteDev function



## -description
The <b>FsRtlMdlWriteCompleteDev</b> routine frees the resources that <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-_fsrtl_advanced_fcb_header-fsrtlpreparemdlwritedev~r6.md">FsRtlPrepareMdlWriteDev</a> allocated.



## -syntax

````
BOOLEAN FsRtlMdlWriteCompleteDev(
  _In_     PFILE_OBJECT   FileObject,
  _In_     PLARGE_INTEGER FileOffset,
  _In_     PMDL           MdlChain,
  _In_opt_ PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject
);
````


## -parameters

### -param FileObject [in]

A pointer to the file object.


### -param FileOffset [in]

A pointer to a value that specifies the starting byte offset within the cache that holds the data.


### -param MdlChain [in]

A pointer to a linked list of memory descriptor lists (MDLs) that <b>FsRtlPrepareMdlWrite</b> allocated.


### -param DeviceObject [in, optional]

The device object for the device that holds the file data.


## -returns
The <b>FsRtlMdlWriteCompleteDev</b> routine returns <b>TRUE</b> if the operation succeeds and <b>FALSE</b> if the operation fails or if the FO_WRITE_THROUGH flag is set in the file object.


## -remarks
The <b>FsRtlMdlWriteCompleteDev</b> routine frees the memory descriptor lists (MDLs) that <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-_fsrtl_advanced_fcb_header-fsrtlpreparemdlwritedev~r6.md">FsRtlPrepareMdlWriteDev</a> allocated and unlocks the cache memory that <b>FsRtlPrepareMdlWriteDev</b> locked.

If the FO_WRITE_THROUGH flag is set on the file object pointed to by the <i>FileObject</i> parameter, <b>FsRtlMdlWriteCompleteDev</b> immediately flushes the cached memory to disk. This flush operation re-enters the file system and can cause <b>FsRtlMdlWriteCompleteDev</b> to raise an exception if the flush operation fails. 

Each call to <b>FsRtlPrepareMdlWrite</b> must be followed by a call to <b>FsRtlMdlWriteCompleteDev</b>.
