# MmPrefetchPages function



## -description
The <b>MmPrefetchPages</b> routine reads groups of pages from secondary storage in the optimal fashion. 



## -syntax

````
NTSTATUS MmPrefetchPages(
  _In_ ULONG      NumberOfLists,
  _In_ PREAD_LIST *ReadLists
);
````


## -parameters

### -param NumberOfLists [in]

The number of read-lists in the array passed in the <i>ReadLists</i> parameter.


### -param ReadLists [in]

A pointer to an array of read-lists to be prefetched.


## -returns
<b>MmPrefetchPages</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS or an appropriate error status representing the final completion status of the operation. Possible error status codes include the following: 
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES</b></dt>
</dl>A temporary buffer required by this function could not be allocated. 

 

<b>MmPrefetchPages</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS on success and also if all of the requested pages were already in memory indicating no reads from secondary storage were required. 


## -remarks
<b>MmPrefetchPages</b> reads pages from secondary storage described in the read-lists in the optimal fashion. The caller builds a list of various file objects and logical block offsets, passing them to the <b>MmPrefetchPages</b> function which examines the internal pages, reading in those that are not already valid or in transition. The pages are read with a single read, using a dummy page to bridge small gaps. If the gap is "large", then separate reads are issued.
