# MmPrefetchPages function
The <b>MmPrefetchPages</b> routine reads groups of pages from secondary storage in the optimal fashion.

## Syntax

```
NTKERNELAPI NTSTATUS MmPrefetchPages(
  ULONG      NumberOfLists,
  PREAD_LIST *ReadLists
);
```

## Parameters

`NumberOfLists`

The number of read-lists in the array passed in the <i>ReadLists</i> parameter.

`ReadLists`

A pointer to an array of read-lists to be prefetched.


## Return Value

<b>MmPrefetchPages</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS or an appropriate error status representing the final completion status of the operation. Possible error status codes include the following: 

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
A temporary buffer required by this function could not be allocated. 

</td>
</tr>
</table>
Â 

<b>MmPrefetchPages</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS on success and also if all of the requested pages were already in memory indicating no reads from secondary storage were required.

## Remarks

<b>MmPrefetchPages</b> reads pages from secondary storage described in the read-lists in the optimal fashion. The caller builds a list of various file objects and logical block offsets, passing them to the <b>MmPrefetchPages</b> function which examines the internal pages, reading in those that are not already valid or in transition. The pages are read with a single read, using a dummy page to bridge small gaps. If the gap is "large", then separate reads are issued.
