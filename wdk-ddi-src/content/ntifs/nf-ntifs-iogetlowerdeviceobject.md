# IoGetLowerDeviceObject function
The <b>IoGetLowerDeviceObject</b> routine returns a pointer to the next-lower-level device object on the driver stack.

## Syntax

````
PDEVICE_OBJECT IoGetLowerDeviceObject(
  _In_ PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject
);
````

## Parameters

`DeviceObject`

A pointer to the device object in the stack for which the next-lower-level device object is to be returned.


## Return Value

<b>IoGetLowerDeviceObject</b> returns a pointer to the next-lower-level device object on the driver stack.

## Remarks

Given a pointer to a device object in a file system or device driver stack, <b>IoGetLowerDeviceObject</b> returns a pointer to the next-lower-level device object on the stack.

<b>IoGetLowerDeviceObject</b> returns <b>NULL</b> if: 

<ul>
<li>
The next-lower-level driver is not loaded. 

</li>
<li>
The next-lower-level driver is currently being unloaded, removed, or deleted. 

</li>
<li>
The device object pointed to by <i>DeviceObject</i> is the lowest device object in the driver stack. 

</li>
</ul>
A file system filter driver typically uses <b>IoGetLowerDeviceObject</b> to determine whether it is already attached to the filter driver stack that is chained above a given file system device object. First, the filter calls <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-iogetattacheddevicereference.md">IoGetAttachedDeviceReference</a> to get a pointer to the topmost device object in the stack. Then it calls <b>IoGetLowerDeviceObject</b> repeatedly to walk the driver stack, checking each device object to see whether the object belongs to the filter driver. 

<b>IoGetLowerDeviceObject</b> increments the reference count on the next-lower-level device object. Thus every successful call to <b>IoGetLowerDeviceObject</b> must be matched by a subsequent call <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-obdereferenceobject.md">ObDereferenceObject</a>.
