# CcUnpinDataForThread function



## -description

## -syntax

````
VOID CcUnpinDataForThread(
  _In_ PVOID            Bcb,
  _In_ ERESOURCE_THREAD ResourceThreadId
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Bcb [in]

Pointer to the BCB for the pages to be released.


### -param ResourceThreadId [in]

## -returns
None


## -remarks
<b>CcUnpinDataForThread</b> releases the BCB for the indicated thread and performs any other necessary cleanup.

Each call to <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-ccsetbcbownerpointer.md">CcSetBcbOwnerPointer</a> must be matched by a subsequent call to <b>CcUnpinDataForThread</b>.

<b>CcUnpinDataForThread</b> is functionally equivalent to <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-ccunpindata.md">CcUnpinData</a>, except that it also releases the BCB resource for the indicated thread.
