# _NFS_OPEN_ECP_CONTEXT structure
The NFS_OPEN_ECP_CONTEXT structure is used by the Network File System (NFS) server to open files in response to client requests.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _NFS_OPEN_ECP_CONTEXT {
  PUNICODE_STRING       ExportAlias;
  PSOCKADDR_STORAGE_NFS ClientSocketAddress;
} NFS_OPEN_ECP_CONTEXT, *PNFS_OPEN_ECP_CONTEXT, **PPNFS_OPEN_ECP_CONTEXT;
````

## Members


`ClientSocketAddress`

A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff570825">SOCKADDR_STORAGE</a> structure that specifies the transport address of the client computer. This client originates the open file request.

`ExportAlias`

A pointer to a <a href="..\wudfwdm\ns-wudfwdm-_unicode_string.md">UNICODE_STRING</a> structure that supplies the export alias (share name) for the NFS server that contains the files to be opened. This member is a hint and can be a name, <b>NULL</b>, or a zero-length string.

## Remarks
The file-system stack can determine whether NFS_OPEN_ECP_CONTEXT is attached to the create file request. The file-system stack can then use the information in NFS_OPEN_ECP_CONTEXT to determine the client that requested that the file be opened and why it was requested. For information about how to retrieve the NFS_OPEN_ECP_CONTEXT extra information that is attached to a create file request, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/using-ecps-to-process-irp-mj-create-operations-in-a-file-system-filter">Retrieving ECPs</a>. 

The NFS_OPEN_ECP_CONTEXT structure is read-only. You should use it to retrieve information about the open file ECP only. For more information about this issue, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6acb4be4-a7aa-431d-b2d8-3ef6d41cb4ef">System-Defined ECPs</a>.
