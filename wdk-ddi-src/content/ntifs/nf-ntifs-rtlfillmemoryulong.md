# RtlFillMemoryUlong function
The <b>RtlFillMemoryUlong</b> routine fills the specified range of memory with one or more repetitions of a ULONG value.

## Syntax

````
VOID RtlFillMemoryUlong(
  _Out_ PVOID  Destination,
  _In_  SIZE_T Length,
  _In_  ULONG  Pattern
);
````

## Parameters

`Destination`

Pointer to a block of memory to be filled. Must be ULONG-aligned.

`Length`

Length in bytes of the memory to fill. Must be a multiple of <b>sizeof(</b>ULONG<b>)</b>. (Note: SIZE_T is defined in <i>basetsd.h</i>.)

`Pattern`

ULONG value with which to fill the memory block.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

If the block of memory at <i>Destination</i> is nonpaged, the caller can be running at any IRQL. Otherwise, callers of <b>RtlFillMemoryUlong</b> must be running at IRQL &lt; DISPATCH_LEVEL.
