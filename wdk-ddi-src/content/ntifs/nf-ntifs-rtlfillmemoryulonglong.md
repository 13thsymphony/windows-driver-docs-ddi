# RtlFillMemoryUlonglong function
The <b>RtlFillMemoryUlonglong</b> routine fills a given range of memory with one or more repetitions of a given ULONGLONG value.

## Syntax

````
VOID RtlFillMemoryUlonglong(
  _Out_ PVOID     Destination,
  _In_  SIZE_T    Length,
  _In_  ULONGLONG Pattern
);
````

## Parameters

`Destination`

Pointer to the start of the range of memory to be filled. This address must be ULONGLONG-aligned.

`Length`

Number of bytes to fill. This value must be a multiple of <b>sizeof(</b>ULONGLONG<b>)</b>. (Note: SIZE_T is defined in <i>basetsd.h</i>.)

`Pattern`

ULONGLONG value with which to fill the range starting at <i>Destination</i> and extending for <i>Length</i> bytes.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

If the range of memory starting at <i>Destination</i> is nonpaged, the caller can be running at any IRQL. Otherwise, callers of <b>RtlFillMemoryUlonglong</b> must be running at IRQL &lt; DISPATCH_LEVEL.
