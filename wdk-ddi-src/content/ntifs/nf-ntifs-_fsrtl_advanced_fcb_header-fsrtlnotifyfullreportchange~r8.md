## -parameters

### -param NotifySync [in]

A pointer to an opaque synchronization object for the current volume.

### -param NotifyList [in]

A pointer to the head of a notify list. Each element in the list is an opaque notify structure.

### -param FullTargetName [in]

A pointer to an ANSI or Unicode string that contains the full pathname of the file.

### -param TargetNameOffset [in]

Offset within the <i>FullTargetName</i> string of the final component of the name.

### -param StreamName [in, optional]

Optional pointer to an ANSI or Unicode string that contains a stream name to store with the file name.

### -param NormalizedParentName [in, optional]

Optional pointer to an ANSI or Unicode string that contains the same path as in the <i>FullTargetName</i> string, but with all short names replaced by the corresponding long names.

### -param FilterMatch [in]

A bitmask of flags to be compared with the completion filter in the notify structure. If any of the corresponding bits in the completion filter are set, then a notify condition exists. For possible flag values, see the <i>CompletionFilter</i> parameter of <a href="ifsk.fsrtlnotifyfullchangedirectory">FsRtlNotifyFullChangeDirectory</a>.

### -param TargetContext [in, optional]
