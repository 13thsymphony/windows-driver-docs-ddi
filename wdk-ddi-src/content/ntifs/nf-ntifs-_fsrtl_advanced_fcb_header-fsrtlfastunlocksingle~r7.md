## -parameters

### -param FileLock [in]

A pointer to the FILE_LOCK structure for the file. This structure must have been initialized by a previous call to <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-_fsrtl_advanced_fcb_header-fsrtlallocatefilelock~r1.md">FsRtlAllocateFileLock</a> or <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-_fsrtl_advanced_fcb_header-fsrtlinitializefilelock~r2.md">FsRtlInitializeFileLock</a>.


### -param FileObject [in]

A pointer to the file object for the file.


### -param FileOffset [in]

A pointer to a variable that specifies the starting byte offset within the file of the range to be unlocked.


### -param Length [in]

A pointer to a variable that specifies the length, in bytes, of the range to be unlocked.


### -param ProcessId [in]

A pointer to the process ID for the process.


### -param Key [in]

The key for the byte-range lock.


### -param Context [in, optional]

An optional context pointer to be used when completing IRPs. 


### -param AlreadySynchronized [in]
