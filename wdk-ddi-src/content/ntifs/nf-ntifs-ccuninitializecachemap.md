# CcUninitializeCacheMap function
The <b>CcUninitializeCacheMap</b> routine stops the caching of a cached file.

## Syntax

````
BOOLEAN CcUninitializeCacheMap(
  _In_     PFILE_OBJECT              FileObject,
  _In_opt_ PLARGE_INTEGER            TruncateSize,
  _In_opt_ PCACHE_UNINITIALIZE_EVENT UninitializeCompleteEvent
);
````

## Parameters

`FileObject`

Pointer to a file object for the cached file.

`TruncateSize`

If specified, the file was truncated to the specified size, and the cache should be purged accordingly.

`UninitializeEvent`

TBD


## Return Value

<b>CcUninitializeCacheMap</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if caching was stopped successfully, <b>FALSE</b> otherwise.

## Remarks

All file systems that support file caching must call <b>CcUninitializeCacheMap</b> when closing a file, whether the file is cached or not. Even if the file was created with caching disabled, the file system still must call <b>CcUninitializeCacheMap</b>.

To cache a file, use <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-ccinitializecachemap.md">CcInitializeCacheMap</a>.
