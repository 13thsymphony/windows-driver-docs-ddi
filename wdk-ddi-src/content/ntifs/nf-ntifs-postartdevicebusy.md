# PoStartDeviceBusy function
The <b>PoStartDeviceBusy</b> routine marks the start of a period of time in which the device is busy.

## Syntax

````
VOID PoStartDeviceBusy(
  _Inout_ PULONG IdlePointer
);
````

## Parameters

`IdlePointer`

A pointer to an idle counter. This is a pointer value that was previously returned by the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-poregisterdeviceforidledetection.md">PoRegisterDeviceForIdleDetection</a> routine. Because <b>PoRegisterDeviceForIdleDetection</b> might return a <b>NULL</b> pointer, the caller must verify that the pointer is non-<b>NULL</b> before it calls <b>PoStartDeviceBusy</b>.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

The <b>PoStartDeviceBusy</b> and <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-poenddevicebusy.md">PoEndDeviceBusy</a> routines mark the start and end of a time period in which a device is busy. Each call to <b>PoStartDeviceBusy</b> must be followed by a corresponding call to <b>PoEndDeviceBusy</b>.

For each device, the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559829">power manager</a> maintains a count of the number of outstanding <b>PoStartDeviceBusy</b> calls for which it has not yet received a corresponding <b>PoEndDeviceBusy</b> call. A <b>PoStartDeviceBusy</b> call increments the busy count by one. A <b>PoEndDeviceBusy</b> call decrements the busy count by one. A nonzero busy count disables the idle counter for the device. After the busy count reaches zero, the power manager resets the idle counter to the time-out period and enables the counter.

Rather than use the <b>PoStartDeviceBusy</b> and <b>PoEndDeviceBusy</b> routines to reset the idle counter, you can call the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-posetdevicebusyex.md">PoSetDeviceBusyEx</a> routine (or the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559755">PoSetDeviceBusy</a> macro). To disable the idle counter during an extended busy period, a driver can call the <b>PoRegisterDeviceForIdleDetection</b> routine to disable and enable idle notifications at the start and end of the busy period. However, <b>PoStartDeviceBusy</b> and <b>PoEndDeviceBusy</b> are typically more convenient to use for this purpose, and you should consider using these routines in new code that you write for Windows 7 and later versions of Windows.
