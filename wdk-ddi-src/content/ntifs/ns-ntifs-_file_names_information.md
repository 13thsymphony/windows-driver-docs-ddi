# _FILE_NAMES_INFORMATION structure
A FILE_NAMES_INFORMATION structure used to query detailed information about the names of files in a directory.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _FILE_NAMES_INFORMATION {
  ULONG NextEntryOffset;
  ULONG FileIndex;
  ULONG FileNameLength;
  WCHAR FileName[1];
} FILE_NAMES_INFORMATION, *PFILE_NAMES_INFORMATION;
````

## Members


`FileIndex`

Byte offset of the file within the parent directory. This member is undefined for file systems, such as NTFS, in which the position of a file within the parent directory is not fixed and can be changed at any time to maintain sort order.

`FileName`

Specifies the first character of the file name string. This is followed in memory by the remainder of the string.

`FileNameLength`

Specifies the length of the file name string.

`NextEntryOffset`

Byte offset for the next FILE_NAMES_INFORMATION entry, if multiple entries are present in a buffer. This member is zero if no other entries follow this one.

## Remarks
This information can be queried in either of the following ways: 

<ul>
<li>
Call <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-zwquerydirectoryfile.md">ZwQueryDirectoryFile</a>, passing FileNamesInformation as the value of <i>FileInformationClass</i> and passing a caller-allocated, FILE_NAMES_INFORMATION-structured buffer as the value of <i>FileInformation</i>. 

</li>
<li>
Create an IRP with major function code IRP_MJ_DIRECTORY_CONTROL and minor function code IRP_MN_QUERY_DIRECTORY. 

</li>
</ul>
No specific access rights are required to query this information. 

This structure must be aligned on a LONG (4-byte) boundary. If a buffer contains two or more of these structures, the <b>NextEntryOffset</b> value in each entry, except the last, falls on a 4-byte boundary.

## Requirements
