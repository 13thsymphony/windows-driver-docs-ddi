# _FSRTL_PER_STREAM_CONTEXT structure



## -description
The <b>FSRTL_PER_STREAM_CONTEXT</b> structure contains context information that a file system filter driver maintains about a file stream. 



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _FSRTL_PER_STREAM_CONTEXT {
  LIST_ENTRY     Links;
  PVOID          OwnerId;
  PVOID          InstanceId;
  PFREE_FUNCTION FreeCallback;
} FSRTL_PER_STREAM_CONTEXT, *PFSRTL_PER_STREAM_CONTEXT;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Links

Link for this structure in the list of all per-stream context structures associated with the same file stream. <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-fsrtlinsertperstreamcontext.md">FsRtlInsertPerStreamContext</a> inserts this member into the list of all per-stream context structures for a file stream. To get a pointer to the head of the list from a file object, use the <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-fsrtlgetperstreamcontextpointer.md">FsRtlGetPerStreamContextPointer</a> macro, and cast the result to a <b>PFSRTL_ADVANCED_FCB_HEADER</b> pointer. The list pointer is the <b>FilterContexts</b> member in the advanced file control block (FCB) header structure for the file stream. 


### -field OwnerId

Pointer to a filter-driver-allocated variable that uniquely identifies the owner of the per-stream context structure. The format of this variable is filter-driver-specific. Filter writers should choose a value that is both meaningful and convenient, such as the address of a driver object or device object. Filter drivers must set this member to a non-<b>NULL</b> value. 


### -field InstanceId

Pointer to a filter-driver-allocated variable that can be used to distinguish among per-stream context structures created by the same filter driver. The format of this variable is filter-driver-specific. Filter writers should choose a value that is both meaningful and convenient, such as the address of the stream context object for the file stream. (To get this address from a file object, use the <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-fsrtlgetperstreamcontextpointer.md">FsRtlGetPerStreamContextPointer</a> macro.) 

This member is optional and can be <b>NULL</b>. 


### -field FreeCallback

Pointer to a callback routine that frees the per-stream context structure. This routine and its parameters are defined as follows: 

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>VOID
(*PFREE_FUNCTION) (
     IN PVOID Buffer
     );</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>



### -field Buffer

Pointer to the <b>FSRTL_PER_STREAM_CONTEXT</b> structure to free. 

</dd>
</dl>

## -remarks
File system filter drivers can use a <b>FSRTL_PER_STREAM_CONTEXT</b> structure to maintain context information for a file stream. This structure can be used as is or embedded in a driver-defined, per-stream context structure. 

When a file system tears down the stream context object for a file stream, it must call <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-fsrtlteardownperstreamcontexts.md">FsRtlTeardownPerStreamContexts</a>, which in turn calls the <i>FreeCallback</i> routines of all per-stream context structures associated with the file stream. 

The <b>FSRTL_PER_STREAM_CONTEXT</b> structure can be allocated from paged or nonpaged pool. 

The <b>FsRtlSupportsPerStreamContexts</b> macro determines whether a file system supports per-stream contexts for a given file stream.
