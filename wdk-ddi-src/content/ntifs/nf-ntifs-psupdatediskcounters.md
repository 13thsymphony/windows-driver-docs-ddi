# PsUpdateDiskCounters function
The <b>PsUpdateDiskCounters</b> routine updates the disk I/O counters of a given process.

## Syntax

````
VOID PsUpdateDiskCounters(
   PEPROCESS Process,
   ULONG64   BytesRead,
   ULONG64   BytesWritten,
   ULONG     ReadOperationCount,
   ULONG     WriteOperationCount,
   ULONG     FlushOperationCount
);
````

## Parameters

`Process`

A pointer to the process to update counters for.

`BytesRead`

The number of bytes to update in the Read counter.

`BytesWritten`

The number of bytes to update in the Write counter.

`ReadOperationCount`

The number of read operations to update in the Read Operation counter.

`WriteOperationCount`

The number of write operations to update in the Write Operation counter.

`FlushOperationCount`

The number of flush operations to update in the Flush Operation counter.


## Return Value
