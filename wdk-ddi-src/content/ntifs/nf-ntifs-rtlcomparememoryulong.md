# RtlCompareMemoryUlong function



## -description
The <b>RtlCompareMemoryUlong</b> routine returns how many bytes in a block of memory match a specified pattern. 



## -syntax

````
SIZE_T RtlCompareMemoryUlong(
  _In_ PVOID  Source,
  _In_ SIZE_T Length,
  _In_ ULONG  Pattern
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Source [in]

Pointer to a block of memory. Must be aligned on a ULONG boundary. 


### -param Length [in]

Number of bytes over which the comparison should be done. Must be a multiple of <b>sizeof(</b>ULONG<b>)</b>. 


### -param Pattern [in]

Pattern to be compared byte by byte, repeatedly, through the specified memory range. 


## -returns
<b>RtlCompareMemoryUlong</b> returns the number of bytes that were compared and found to be equal. If all bytes compare as equal, the input <i>Length</i> is returned. <b>RtlCompareMemoryUlong</b> returns zero if <i>Source</i> is not ULONG-aligned or if <i>Length</i> is not a multiple of <b>sizeof(</b>ULONG<b>)</b>. 


## -remarks
If the block of memory at <i>Source</i> is nonpaged, the caller can be running at any IRQL. Otherwise, callers of <b>RtlCompareMemoryUlong</b> must be running at IRQL &lt; DISPATCH_LEVEL.
