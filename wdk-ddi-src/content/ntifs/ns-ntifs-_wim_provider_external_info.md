# _WIM_PROVIDER_EXTERNAL_INFO structure
The <b>WIM_PROVIDER_EXTERNAL_INFO</b> structure holds the identifier and status information for the Windows Image File (WIM) external backing provider.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _WIM_PROVIDER_EXTERNAL_INFO {
  ULONG         Version;
  ULONG         Flags;
  LARGE_INTEGER DataSourceId;
  UCHAR         ResourceHash[WIM_PROVIDER_HASH_SIZE];
} WIM_PROVIDER_EXTERNAL_INFO, *PWIM_PROVIDER_EXTERNAL_INFO;
````

## Members


`DataSourceId`

An identifier value for the WIM file data source.

`Flags`

The status flags for the WIM provider. Set to 0 when active. Otherwise <b>Flags</b> is set to one of the following values.
<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="WIM_PROVIDER_EXTERNAL_FLAG_NOT_ACTIVE"></a><a id="wim_provider_external_flag_not_active"></a><dl>
<dt><b>WIM_PROVIDER_EXTERNAL_FLAG_NOT_ACTIVE</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The WIM provider is not active. This can occur when the WIM file is  not found. In this case the WIM file will not be recovered.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a id="WIM_PROVIDER_EXTERNAL_FLAG_SUSPENDED"></a><a id="wim_provider_external_flag_suspended"></a><dl>
<dt><b>WIM_PROVIDER_EXTERNAL_FLAG_SUSPENDED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Indicates that the provider is dismounted. Recovery will be attempted.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`ResourceHash`

An identifier for the object contained within the WIM.  Conventionally a hash of the contents of a file, stored within the WIM.

`Version`

The WIM provider version. Set to WIM_PROVIDER_CURRENT_VERSION.

## Remarks
The backing source for a file is set with a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn632443">FSCTL_SET_EXTERNAL_BACKING</a> control code request. The WIM file backing the file specified in the request is set in the <b>DataSourceId</b> member of <b>WIM_PROVIDER_EXTERNAL_INFO</b>.

The <b>Flags</b> and <b>ResourceHash</b> members are valid when the provider info is returned from a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn632441">FSCTL_GET_EXTERNAL_BACKING</a> request.
