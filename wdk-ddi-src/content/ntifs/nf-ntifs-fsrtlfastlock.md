# FsRtlFastLock macro



## -description
The <b>FsRtlFastLock</b> macro is used by file systems and filter drivers to request a byte-range lock for a file stream. 



## -syntax

````
BOOLEAN FsRtlFastLock(
  _In_  PFILE_LOCK       FileLock,
  _In_  PFILE_OBJECT     FileObject,
  _In_  PLARGE_INTEGER   FileOffset,
  _In_  PLARGE_INTEGER   Length,
  _In_  PEPROCESS        ProcessId,
  _In_  ULONG            Key,
  _In_  BOOLEAN          FailImmediately,
  _In_  BOOLEAN          ExclusiveLock,
  _Out_ PIO_STATUS_BLOCK Iosb,
  _In_  PVOID            Context,
  _In_  BOOLEAN          AlreadySynchronized
);
````


## -parameters

### -param FileLock [in]

Pointer to the FILE_LOCK structure for the file. This structure must have been initialized by a previous call to <a href="ifsk.fsrtlallocatefilelock">FsRtlAllocateFileLock</a> or <a href="ifsk.fsrtlinitializefilelock">FsRtlInitializeFileLock</a>.


### -param FileObject [in]

Pointer to the file object for the open file. The file object must have been created with GENERIC_READ or GENERIC_WRITE access to the file (or both). 


### -param FileOffset [in]

Pointer to a variable that specifies the starting byte offset within the file of the range to be locked.


### -param Length [in]

Pointer to a variable that specifies the length in bytes of the range to be locked.


### -param ProcessId [in]

Pointer to the process ID for the process requesting the byte-range lock.


### -param Key [in]

The key to be assigned to the byte-range lock.


### -param FailImmediately [in]

Boolean value specifying whether the lock request should fail if the lock cannot be granted immediately. If the caller can be put into a wait state until the request is granted, set <i>FailImmediately</i> to <b>FALSE</b>. If it cannot, set <i>FailImmediately</i> to <b>TRUE</b>. 


### -param ExclusiveLock [in]

Set to <b>TRUE</b> if an exclusive lock is requested, <b>FALSE</b> if a shared lock is requested.


### -param Iosb [out]

Pointer to a caller-allocated IO_STATUS_BLOCK structure that receives status information about the lock request. 


### -param Context [in]

Optional pointer to a context to use when releasing the byte-range lock. 


### -param AlreadySynchronized [in]

This parameter is obsolete, but is retained for compatibility with legacy drivers.


## -remarks
The <b>FsRtlFastLock</b> macro causes the caller to acquire a byte-range lock on a region of the specified file.

A return value of <b>TRUE</b> indicates that the IO_STATUS_BLOCK structure pointed to by <i>Iosb</i> received status information about the lock operation. To examine the contents of this structure, use the NT_STATUS macro.
