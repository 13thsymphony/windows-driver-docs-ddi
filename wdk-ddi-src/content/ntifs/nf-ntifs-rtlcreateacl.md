# RtlCreateAcl function
The <b>RtlCreateAcl</b> routine creates and initializes an access control list (ACL).

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS RtlCreateAcl(
  _Out_ PACL  Acl,
  _In_  ULONG AclLength,
  _In_  ULONG AceRevision
);
````

## Parameters

`Acl`

Pointer to a caller-allocated buffer to receive the initialized ACL structure. This buffer must be at least <b>sizeof</b>(ACL),

`AclLength`

Length, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by the <i>Acl</i> parameter. This value must be large enough to contain the ACL header and all of the access-control entries (ACE) to be stored in the ACL. See the following Remarks section for information about calculating the size of an ACL.

`AclRevision`




## Return Value

<b>RtlCreateAcl</b> can return one of the following status values:
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>The ACL was successfully created and initialized.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL</b></dt>
</dl>The new ACL does not fit into the buffer at <i>Acl</i>. A larger ACL buffer is required. 
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</b></dt>
</dl>The specified revision is not current, or the value of <i>AclLength</i> is too large.

## Remarks

The ACL that is initialized by <b>RtlCreateAcl</b> contains no access control entries (ACE). This ACL is empty, as opposed to being a nonexistent ACL. If an empty ACL is applied to an object, the ACL implicitly denies all access to that object. To add ACEs to the ACL, use <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-rtladdaccessallowedace.md">RtlAddAccessAllowedAce</a>.

To calculate the size of an ACL, add <b>sizeof</b>(ACL) to the size of all the ACEs to be stored in the ACL. To calculate the size of an ACE, add the size of the ACE structure, such as <b>sizeof</b>(ACCESS_ALLOWED_ACE), to the length of the SID associated with the ACE, and then subtract the size of the <b>SidStart</b> member (which is part of both the ACE structure and the SID). Use the <a href="..\ntifs\nf-ntifs-rtllengthsid.md">RtlLengthSid</a> function to get the length of a specified SID.

The following example shows how to calculate the size of an access-allowed ACE:

To calculate the size of an ACL, use the following algorithm, substituting the appropriate ACE structure in the <b>sizeof</b>(ACE) expression:

For more information about security and access control, see the documentation on these topics in thePlatform Software Development Kit (SDK).
