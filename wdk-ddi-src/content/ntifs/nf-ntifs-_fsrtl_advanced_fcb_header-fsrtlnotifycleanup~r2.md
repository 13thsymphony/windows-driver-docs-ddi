# FsRtlNotifyCleanup function



## -description
When the last handle to a file object is released, the <b>FsRtlNotifyCleanup</b> routine removes the file object's notify structure, if present, from the specified notify list.



## -syntax

````
VOID FsRtlNotifyCleanup(
  _In_ PNOTIFY_SYNC NotifySync,
  _In_ PLIST_ENTRY  NotifyList,
  _In_ PVOID        FsContext
);
````


## -parameters

### -param NotifySync [in]

A pointer to an opaque synchronization object for <i>NotifyList</i>. 


### -param NotifyList [in]

A pointer to the head of a notify list. Each element in the list is an opaque notify structure.


### -param FsContext [in]

A unique value assigned by the file system to identify a notify structure as belonging to a particular file object.


## -returns
None


## -remarks
If a notify structure is found that matches <i>FsContext</i>, <b>FsRtlNotifyCleanup</b> completes all IRPs that are queued in the notify structure. When all the IRPs are completed, <b>FsRtlNotifyCleanup</b> removes the notify structure from the notify list and deallocates it.
