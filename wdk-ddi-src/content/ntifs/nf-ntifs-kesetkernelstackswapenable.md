# KeSetKernelStackSwapEnable function
The <b>KeSetKernelStackSwapEnable</b> routine enables and disables swapping of the caller's stack to disk.

## Syntax

````
BOOLEAN KeSetKernelStackSwapEnable(
  _In_ BOOLEAN Enable
);
````

## Parameters

`Enable`

Specifies whether to enable swapping of the stack that belongs to the calling thread. If <b>TRUE</b>, swapping is enabled and the contents of the stack can be paged in and out of memory. If <b>FALSE</b>, swapping is disabled and the stack is memory-resident.


## Return Value

<b>KeSetKernelStackSwapEnable</b> returns a BOOLEAN value that indicates whether stack swapping was enabled at the time that the call was initiated. This value is <b>TRUE</b> if stack swapping was previously enabled and is <b>FALSE</b> if it was disabled.

## Remarks

A kernel-mode driver can call this routine to control whether its stack is pageable or locked in memory.

Stack swapping can occur only if the thread is in a wait state that was caused by a request from a user-mode application. Stack swapping never occurs for wait states that are initiated by kernel-mode components, regardless of whether stack swapping is enabled.

It is not typically necessary to disable stack swapping. Do this only in  rare cases. For an example that discusses alternatives to disabling stack swapping, see the following Examples section.

In a call to a kernel-mode wait routine, such as <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-kewaitforsingleobject.md">KeWaitForSingleObject</a>, the caller specifies a <i>WaitMode</i> parameter to indicate whether the caller waits in kernel mode or user mode. If <i>WaitMode</i> = <b>UserMode</b>, and if the wait duration is sufficiently long, the memory manager might page out sections of the stack that belongs to the waiting thread. However, if the stack contains data items that must remain memory-resident for the duration of the wait, the thread can prevent the stack from being paged out by calling <b>KeSetKernelStackSwapEnable</b> and specifying <i>Enable</i> = <b>FALSE</b>.

A thread must not exit (terminate) while stack swapping is disabled or a system bug check will occur.
