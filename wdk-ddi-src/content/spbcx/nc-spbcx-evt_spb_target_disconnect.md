# EVT_SPB_TARGET_DISCONNECT function
An SPB controller driver's <i>EvtSpbTargetDisconnect</i> event callback function closes a connection to a target device that was previously opened by a call to the driver's  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/D90DD169-A989-4D08-B1B8-BDE7EC9B7A82">EvtSpbTargetConnect</a> event callback function.

## Syntax

```
EVT_SPB_TARGET_DISCONNECT EvtSpbTargetDisconnect;

void EvtSpbTargetDisconnect(
  WDFDEVICE Controller,
  SPBTARGET Target
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Controller`

A WDFDEVICE handle to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6be47eac-d6e4-43d1-bf2d-d49dcb2273c0">framework device object</a> that represents the SPB controller.

`Target`

A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/spb/spbcx-object-handles">SPBTARGET</a> handle to the target to close. The target is a peripheral device or port that is attached to the bus. The SPB framework extension (SpbCx) previously assigned this handle to the target in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/D90DD169-A989-4D08-B1B8-BDE7EC9B7A82">EvtSpbTargetConnect</a> callback that opened the connection to the target.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

Implementation of this function by the SPB controller driver is optional.

SpbCx manages the I/O queue for the SPB controller. If the SPB controller driver registers an <i>EvtSpbTargetDisconnect</i> callback function, SpbCx calls this function when a client (peripheral driver) of the controller driver sends an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550720">IRP_MJ_CLOSE</a> request to close an SPBTARGET handle. This handle represents a connection to a target device on the bus that the client opened in a previous <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548630">IRP_MJ_CREATE</a> request. If the <i>EvtSpbTargetDisconnect</i> function returns an error code, SpbCx fails the <b>IRP_MJ_CLOSE</b> request.

The <i>EvtSpbTargetDisconnect</i> function is called synchronously from the context of the client's closing thread after all client-initiated I/O operations have ended and after the client has unlocked the controller (if the client previously locked the controller).

If the SPB controller driver has allocated I/O requests and sent them to the next-lower driver in the I/O-request chain for the target device, the <i>EvtSpbTargetDisconnect</i> function should cancel these requests before it returns.

A client driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543233">DispatchCleanup</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff559951">CreateProcessNotifyEx</a> callback routines can be called at any time after the <i>EvtSpbTargetDisconnect</i> callback returns. When the client driver's process exits, its <i>CreateProcessNotifyEx</i> routine is called just before the last thread to exit the process is destroyed.

To register an <i>EvtSpbTargetDisconnect</i> callback function, call the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh450919">SpbDeviceInitialize</a> method.
