typedef struct _D3DKMT_RELEASEKEYEDMUTEX2 {
  D3DKMT_HANDLE hKeyedMutex;
  UINT64        Key;
  UINT64        FenceValue;
  VOID          *pPrivateRuntimeData;
  UINT          PrivateRuntimeDataSize;
} D3DKMT_RELEASEKEYEDMUTEX2;

## Members


`FenceValue`

[in] A 64-bit value that specifies the current fence value of the GPU synchronization object.

`hKeyedMutex`
