# _D3DKMT_DEVICERESET_STATE structure



## -description
The D3DKMT_DEVICERESET_STATE structure identifies reset status.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _D3DKMT_DEVICERESET_STATE {
  union {
    struct {
      UINT DesktopSwitched  :1;
      UINT Reserved  :31;
    };
    UINT   Value;
  };
} D3DKMT_DEVICERESET_STATE;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field DesktopSwitched

A UINT value that specifies whether the desktop that the calling process is created on switched from being visible to being invisible. For example, when the security screen appears because a user pressed CTRL+ALT+DEL, the desktop that the calling process is created on becomes invisible. 

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000001).


### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member to zero is equivalent to setting the remaining 31 bits (0xFFFFFFFE) of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member to zeros.


### -field Value

A 32-bit value that identifies reset status.
