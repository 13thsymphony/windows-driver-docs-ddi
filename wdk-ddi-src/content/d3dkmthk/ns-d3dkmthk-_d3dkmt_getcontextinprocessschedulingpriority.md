# _D3DKMT_GETCONTEXTINPROCESSSCHEDULINGPRIORITY structure



## -description
Describes information that is required for an in-process (in-proc) Microsoft Direct3D composition device to retrieve the scheduling priority for a device context that is in the same process as other device contexts.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _D3DKMT_GETCONTEXTINPROCESSSCHEDULINGPRIORITY {
  D3DKMT_HANDLE hContext;
  INT           Priority;
} D3DKMT_GETCONTEXTINPROCESSSCHEDULINGPRIORITY;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field hContext

[in] A D3DKMT_HANDLE data type that represents the kernel-mode handle to the device context to retrieve scheduling priority for.


### -field Priority

[out] The priority level that is retrieved for the device context relative to other device contexts within the same process.

A value of zero indicates that the context is scheduled with the same priority as other contexts within the same process.

A value of 1 indicates that the context is scheduled ahead of other contexts within the same process.


## -remarks
