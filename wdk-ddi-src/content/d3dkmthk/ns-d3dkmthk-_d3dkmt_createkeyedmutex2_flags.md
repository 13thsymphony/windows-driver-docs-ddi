# _D3DKMT_CREATEKEYEDMUTEX2_FLAGS structure



## -description
Indicates how a handle to a keyed mutex is specified.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _D3DKMT_CREATEKEYEDMUTEX2_FLAGS {
  union {
    struct {
      UINT NtSecuritySharing  :1;
      UINT Reserved  :31;
    };
    UINT   Value;
  };
} D3DKMT_CREATEKEYEDMUTEX2_FLAGS;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field NtSecuritySharing

A UINT value that specifies whether the keyed mutex is shared or has a global <b>D3DKMT_HANDLE</b> kernel-mode handle to the resource.

If <b>NtSecuritySharing</b> is set to 1 (<b>TRUE</b>), the keyed mutex is shared using the <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtshareobjects.md">D3DKMTShareObjects</a> function but does not have a global <b>D3DKMT_HANDLE</b> handle to the resource. In this case, the process handle to the resource is provided by the <a href="..\d3dkmthk\ns-d3dkmthk-_d3dkmt_createkeyedmutex2.md">D3DKMT_CREATEKEYEDMUTEX2</a>.<b>hKeyedMutex</b> member in a call to the <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtcreatekeyedmutex2.md">D3DKMTCreateKeyedMutex2</a> function.

If <b>NtSecuritySharing</b> is set to zero (<b>FALSE</b>), the keyed mutex has a global <b>D3DKMT_HANDLE</b> handle to the resource provided by  the <a href="..\d3dkmthk\ns-d3dkmthk-_d3dkmt_createkeyedmutex2.md">D3DKMT_CREATEKEYEDMUTEX2</a>.<b>hSharedHandle</b> member in a call to <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtcreatekeyedmutex2.md">D3DKMTCreateKeyedMutex2</a>.


### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member is equivalent to setting the remaining 31 bits (0xFFFFFFFE) of a 32-bit value to zeros.


### -field Value

[in] A member in the union that <b>D3DKMT_CREATEKEYEDMUTEX2_FLAGS</b> contains that can hold a 32-bit value that identifies the keyed mutex  sharing type.
