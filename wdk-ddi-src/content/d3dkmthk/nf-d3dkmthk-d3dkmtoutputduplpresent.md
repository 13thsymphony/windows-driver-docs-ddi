# D3DKMTOutputDuplPresent function
Submits a present command from the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/523FBFAD-5D78-4EE3-A3B7-8FD5BA39DC46">Desktop Duplication API</a> swapchain of the Desktop Window Manager (DWM) to the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem (Dxgkrnl.sys).

## Syntax

````
EXTERN_C _Check_return_ NTSTATUS APIENTRY D3DKMTOutputDuplPresent(
  _In_ const D3DKMT_OUTPUTDUPLPRESENT pData
);
````

## Parameters

`D3DKMT_OUTPUTDUPLPRESENT`

TBD


## Return Value

Returns one of the following values:

</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The primary surface handle was invalidated because of a display mode change. If the OpenGL installable client driver (ICD) receives this error code, it should reopen or re-create the primary handle, replace all references in the command buffer to the old handle with the new handle, and then resubmit the buffer.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_GRAPHICS_GPU_EXCEPTION_ON_DEVICE</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
An error occurred on the rendering device context that the <b>hContext</b> member of <a href="..\d3dkmthk\ns-d3dkmthk-_d3dkmt_outputduplpresent.md">D3DKMT_OUTPUTDUPLPRESENT</a> specifies. 

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    This error code does not indicate the initiation of a Timeout Detection and Recovery (TDR) process or that the GPU stopped responding.</div>
<div> </div>
For example, the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem puts a device into an error state if the display miniport driver indicated that a DMA buffer that was submitted from this device caused a fault or if the video memory manager could not page-in all of the allocations that are required for a DMA buffer even after splitting the DMA buffer. After a device is in an error state, it cannot perform any more operations and must be destroyed and re-created. The ICD can call the <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtgetdevicestate.md">D3DKMTGetDeviceState</a> function to determine a more precise reason for the error.
