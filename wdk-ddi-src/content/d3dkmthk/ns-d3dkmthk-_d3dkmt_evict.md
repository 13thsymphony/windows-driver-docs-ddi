## -description
<b>D3DKMT_EVICT</b> is used with <a href="display.d3dkmtevict">D3DKMTEvict</a> to subtract one from the residency reference count.

Once this count reaches zero, it will remove the allocation from the device residency list.
  



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _D3DKMT_EVICT {
  D3DKMT_HANDLE       hDevice;
  UINT                NumAllocations;
  const D3DKMT_HANDLE *AllocationList;
  D3DDDI_EVICT_FLAGS  Flags;
  UINT64              NumBytesToTrim;
} D3DKMT_EVICT;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field hDevice

[in] Device that created the allocations passed to this call.


### -field NumAllocations

[in] Number of allocation handles in the <b>AllocationList</b> array.


### -field AllocationList

[in] An array of <b>NumAllocations</b> allocation handles to mark for eviction. All allocations must be created on <b>hDevice</b>.


### -field Flags

[in] Specifies eviction behavior as documented in <a href="..\d3dukmdt\ns-d3dukmdt-d3dddi_evict_flags.md">D3DDDI_EVICT_FLAGS</a>.
