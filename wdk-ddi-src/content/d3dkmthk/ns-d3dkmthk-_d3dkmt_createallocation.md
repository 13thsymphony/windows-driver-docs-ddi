# _D3DKMT_CREATEALLOCATION structure

## Members


`Flags`

[in] A <a href="..\d3dkmthk\ns-d3dkmthk-_d3dkmt_createallocationflags.md">D3DKMT_CREATEALLOCATIONFLAGS</a> structure that identifies  attributes for creating the allocation, in bit-field flags.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  If  you set the <b>CreateShared</b> bit-field flag in <b>Flags</b>, you must also set the <b>CreateResource</b> bit-field flag.</div><div> </div>

`hDevice`

[in] A handle to the device that the resource or allocation is associated with.

`hGlobalShare`

[out] A handle to the shared resource. The driver should always set the value in <b>hGlobalShare</b> to zero. 

When the driver sets the <b>CreateShared</b> bit-field flag in <b>Flags</b> to create a shared resource, the OpenGL runtime generates a shared handle that is unique across all of the devices and passes it back to the driver in <b>hGlobalShare</b>.<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  If you set  <b>CreateShared</b>, you must also set the <b>CreateResource</b> bit-field flag.</div>
<div> </div>

`hPrivateRuntimeResourceHandle`

[in] An opaque handle that you can use in event tracing. This handle can be used to associate kernel-mode allocations with user-mode surface pointers when you analyze Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) event logs.

`hResource`

[in/out] A D3DKMT_HANDLE data type that represents a kernel-mode handle to the resource that is associated with the allocations. The value in <b>hResource</b> should always be zero unless an allocation will be added to an existing resource, in which case <b>hResource</b> contains the resource handle. 

When the <b>CreateResource</b> bit-field flag is set in the <b>Flags</b> member, the OpenGL runtime generates a unique handle and passes it back to the driver. On output from the <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtcreateallocation.md">D3DKMTCreateAllocation</a> function, <b>hResource</b> specifies the handle that the driver should use in subsequent OpenGL runtime calls to identify the resource. The resource handle that is returned is device-specific and is valid only when used with the device that it was created on.

`NumAllocations`

[in] The number of elements in the array that <b>pAllocationInfo</b> specifies, which represents the number of allocations to create. Note that creating a resource without any allocations initially associated with it is valid; therefore, <b>NumAllocations</b> can be set to 0.

`pPrivateRuntimeData`

[in] A pointer to optional private data that can be attached to a resource for debugging purposes. This data is per resource and not per allocation.

`PrivateDriverDataSize`

[in/out] The size, in bytes, of the private data that <b>pPrivateDriverData</b> points to.

`PrivateRuntimeDataSize`

[in] The size, in bytes, of the private data that <b>pPrivateRuntimeData</b> points to.
