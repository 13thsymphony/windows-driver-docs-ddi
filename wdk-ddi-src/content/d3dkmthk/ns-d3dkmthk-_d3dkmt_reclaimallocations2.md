## -struct-fields

### -field hPagingQueue

[in] A handle to the device that created the allocations.


### -field NumAllocations

[in] The number of items in the <b>pResources</b>, <b>HandleList</b>, or  <b>pDiscarded</b> members, whichever is not <b>NULL</b>.


### -field pResources

[in] An array of <b>D3DKMT_HANDLE</b> data types that represent Direct3D runtime resource handles.


### -field HandleList

[in] An array of <b>D3DKMT_HANDLE</b> data types that represent kernel-mode handles to the allocations that are to be reclaimed.

If <b>HandleList</b> is not <b>NULL</b>, the <b>pResources</b> member must be <b>NULL</b>.


### -field pDiscarded

[out] Optional array of boolean variables  specifying whether each resource or allocation was discarded.


### -field pResults

[in] Required array of values specifying whether the surface is valid, discarded, or list commitment.


### -field PagingFenceValue

The paging fence to synchronize against before submitting work to the GPU which references any of the resources or allocations in the provided arrays.
