# _D3DKMT_FLIPINFOFLAGS structure
The D3DKMT_FLIPINFOFLAGS structure identifies flipping capabilities of the display miniport driver that the OpenGL installable client driver (ICD) obtains by calling the <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtqueryadapterinfo.md">D3DKMTQueryAdapterInfo</a> function.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DKMT_FLIPINFOFLAGS {
  UINT FlipInterval  :1;
  UINT Reserved  :31;
} D3DKMT_FLIPINFOFLAGS;
````

## Members


`FlipInterval`

A UINT value that specifies whether the display miniport driver natively supports the scheduling of a flip command to take effect after two, three or four vertical syncs occur. Regardless of whether the display miniport driver supports a flip interval of two or greater, the driver must support an immediate flip and a flip interval of one.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of a 32-bit value (0x00000001).

`Reserved`

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member is equivalent to setting the remaining 31 bits (0xFFFFFFFE) of a 32-bit value to zeros.
