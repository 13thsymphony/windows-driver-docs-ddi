# D3DKMTFreeGpuVirtualAddress function
<b>D3DKMTFreeGpuVirtualAddress</b> releases a range of graphics processing unit (GPU) virtual addresses, which was previously reserved or mapped.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS APIENTRY D3DKMTFreeGpuVirtualAddress(
  _In_ const D3DKMT_FREEGPUVIRTUALADDRESS *pData
);
````

## Parameters

`D3DKMT_FREEGPUVIRTUALADDRESS`




## Return Value

<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>The device context was successfully created.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</b></dt>
</dl>Parameters were validated and determined to be incorrect.

 

This function might also return other <b>NTSTATUS</b> values.

## Remarks

The freed virtual address should not be accessed immediately after the call. If there are outstanding <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtmapgpuvirtualaddress.md">MapGpuVirtualAddress</a> and <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtupdategpuvirtualaddress.md">UpdateGpuVirtualAddress</a> operations, which reference the virtual address, they will be ignored after the virtual address is freed. A new virtual address range can be allocated in place of the freed one immediately after return from the function.
