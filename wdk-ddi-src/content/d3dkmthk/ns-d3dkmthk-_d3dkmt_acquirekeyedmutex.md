# _D3DKMT_ACQUIREKEYEDMUTEX structure
The D3DKMT_ACQUIREKEYEDMUTEX structure describes a keyed mutex that the <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtacquirekeyedmutex.md">D3DKMTAcquireKeyedMutex</a> function acquires.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DKMT_ACQUIREKEYEDMUTEX {
  D3DKMT_HANDLE  hKeyedMutex;
  UINT64         Key;
  PLARGE_INTEGER pTimeout;
  UINT64         FenceValue;
} D3DKMT_ACQUIREKEYEDMUTEX;
````

## Members


`FenceValue`

[out] A 64-bit value that specifies the current fence value of the GPU synchronization object.

`hKeyedMutex`

[in] A D3DKMT_HANDLE data type that represents a kernel-mode handle to the keyed mutex object to acquire.

`Key`

[in] A 64-bit value that specifies the key value to acquire the mutex for.

`pTimeout`

[in] A pointer to a time-out value that specifies the absolute or relative time, in 100-nanosecond units, at which acquiring the mutex is to be completed. 

A positive value specifies an absolute time, relative to January 1, 1601. A negative value specifies an interval relative to the current time. Absolute expiration times track any changes in the system time; relative expiration times are not affected by system time changes. 

If *<b>pTimeout</b> = 0, <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtacquirekeyedmutex.md">D3DKMTAcquireKeyedMutex</a> returns without waiting. If the caller supplies a <b>NULL</b> pointer, <b>D3DKMTAcquireKeyedMutex</b> waits indefinitely until the mutex object is set to the signaled state.
