This function might also return other <b>NTSTATUS</b> values.

## Remarks

The kernel controls the memory referenced by the display context created by the <b>D3DKMTCreateDCFromMemory</b> function. You must call the  <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtdestroydcfrommemory.md">D3DKMTDestoryDCFromMemory</a> function to free the memory referenced by the display context. Any  other approach  to free this memory will fail. 

During the execution of the <b>D3DKMTCreateDCFromMemory</b> function, the kernel locks and probes the referenced memory by performing a non-thread safe write to each page in the memory. No other threads in your process should be trying to access any part of this memory for the duration of the <b>D3DKMTCreateDCFromMemory</b> call; otherwise, the results will be undefined.
