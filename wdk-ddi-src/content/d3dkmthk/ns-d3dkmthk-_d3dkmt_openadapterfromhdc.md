# _D3DKMT_OPENADAPTERFROMHDC structure
The D3DKMT_OPENADAPTERFROMHDC structure describes the mapping of a device context handle (HDC) to a graphics adapter handle and monitor output.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DKMT_OPENADAPTERFROMHDC {
  HDC                            hDc;
  D3DKMT_HANDLE                  hAdapter;
  LUID                           AdapterLuid;
  D3DDDI_VIDEO_PRESENT_SOURCE_ID VidPnSourceId;
} D3DKMT_OPENADAPTERFROMHDC;
````

## Members


`AdapterLuid`

[out] The locally unique identifier (<a href="..\igpupvdev\ns-igpupvdev-_luid.md">LUID</a>) of the graphics adapter for the HDC that <b>hDc</b> specifies. The LUID is returned from the <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtopenadapterfromhdc.md">D3DKMTOpenAdapterFromHdc</a> call.

`hAdapter`

[out] A handle to the graphics adapter for the HDC that <b>hDc</b> specifies. The adapter handle is returned from the call to the <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtopenadapterfromhdc.md">D3DKMTOpenAdapterFromHdc</a> function.

`hDc`

[in] The HDC for the graphics adapter and monitor output that are retrieved.

`VidPnSourceId`

[out] The zero-based identification number of the video present source in a path of a video present network (VidPN) topology for the HDC that <b>hDc</b> specifies. The identification number is returned from the <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtopenadapterfromhdc.md">D3DKMTOpenAdapterFromHdc</a> call.
