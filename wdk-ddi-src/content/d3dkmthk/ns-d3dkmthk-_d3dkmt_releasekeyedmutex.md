# _D3DKMT_RELEASEKEYEDMUTEX structure
The D3DKMT_RELEASEKEYEDMUTEX structure describes a keyed mutex that the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547129">D3DKMTReleaseKeyedMutex</a> function releases.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct _D3DKMT_RELEASEKEYEDMUTEX {
  D3DKMT_HANDLE hKeyedMutex;
  UINT64        Key;
  UINT64        FenceValue;
} D3DKMT_RELEASEKEYEDMUTEX;
```

## Members


`hKeyedMutex`

[in] A D3DKMT_HANDLE data type that represents a kernel-mode handle to the keyed mutex object to release.

`Key`

[in] A 64-bit value that specifies the key value to release the mutex to.

`FenceValue`

[in] A 64-bit value that specifies the current fence value of the GPU synchronization object.
