#### Examples

The following code example demonstrates how an OpenGL ICD can use <b>D3DKMTLock</b> to lock an entire allocation.

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>VOID* LockEntireAllocation(D3DKMT_HANDLE hDevice, D3DKMT_HANDLE hAllocation, UINT PrivateData)
{
    D3DKMT_LOCK LockAllocation = {0};

    LockAllocation.hDevice = hDevice;
    LockAllocation.hAllocation = LockData.hAllocation;
    LockAllocation.Flags.LockEntire = TRUE;
    LockAllocation.PrivateDriverData = PrivateData;
    LockAllocation.NumPages = 0;
    LockAllocation.pPages = NULL;
 
    if (NT_SUCCESS((*pfnKTLock)(&amp;LockAllocation))) {
        return LockAllocation.pData;
    }
    return NULL;
}</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
