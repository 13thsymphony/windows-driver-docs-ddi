# _D3DKMT_SETALLOCATIONPRIORITY structure
The D3DKMT_SETALLOCATIONPRIORITY structure describes the priority level to set a resource or list of allocations to.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DKMT_SETALLOCATIONPRIORITY {
  D3DKMT_HANDLE       hDevice;
  D3DKMT_HANDLE       hResource;
  const D3DKMT_HANDLE *phAllocationList;
  UINT                AllocationCount;
  const UINT          *pPriorities;
} D3DKMT_SETALLOCATIONPRIORITY;
````

## Members


`AllocationCount`

[in] The number of allocations in the array that <b>phAllocationList</b> specifies. If the OpenGL ICD sets the handle in the <b>hResource</b> member to a non-<b>NULL</b> value, it must set <b>AllocationCount</b> to zero.

`hDevice`

[in] A D3DKMT_HANDLE data type that represents a kernel-mode handle to the device that the resource or list of allocations are associated with.

`hResource`

[in] A handle to a resource whose priority must be set. If the OpenGL ICD uses the array that <b>phAllocationList</b> specifies to set the priority for the list of allocations, it sets <b>hResource</b> to <b>NULL</b>. If the OpenGL ICD sets <b>hResource</b> to a non-<b>NULL</b> value, it must set the <b>AllocationCount</b> member to zero and <b>phAllocationList</b> to <b>NULL</b>. 

If <b>hResource</b> is non-<b>NULL</b>, all of the allocations that belong to the resource are set to the priority that is specified by the first element in the array that <b>pPriorities</b> points to.

`phAllocationList`

[in] An array of D3DKMT_HANDLE data types that represent kernel-mode handles to the allocations. If the OpenGL ICD sets the handle in the <b>hResource</b> member to a non-<b>NULL</b> value, it must set <b>phAllocationList</b> to <b>NULL</b>.

`pPriorities`

[in] A pointer to an array of priority levels. If the <b>hResource</b> member is non-<b>NULL</b>, the array must contain a single element. If <b>hResource</b> is <b>NULL</b>, the number of elements in the array is specified by the <b>AllocationCount</b> member, and each allocation in the array that <b>phAllocationList</b> specifies is set to the priority level of the corresponding element in <b>pPriorities</b>.

Each element in <b>pPriorities</b> can be set to one of the following values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Enumerator</th>
<th>Meaning</th>

<tr>

D3DDDI_ALLOCATIONPRIORITY_MINIMUM (0x28000000)
