# _D3DKMT_WAITFORVERTICALBLANKEVENT structure
The D3DKMT_WAITFORVERTICALBLANKEVENT structure describes parameters for waiting for the vertical blanking interval to occur.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DKMT_WAITFORVERTICALBLANKEVENT {
  D3DKMT_HANDLE                  hAdapter;
  D3DKMT_HANDLE                  hDevice;
  D3DDDI_VIDEO_PRESENT_SOURCE_ID VidPnSourceId;
} D3DKMT_WAITFORVERTICALBLANKEVENT;
````

## Members


`hAdapter`

[in] A handle to the adapter.

`hDevice`

[in] A handle to the display device. This member is optionally specified. However, if the OpenGL ICD specifies the display device, the kernel is given more optimization opportunities with regard to power usage.

`VidPnSourceId`

[in] The zero-based identification number of the video present source in a path of a video present network (VidPN) topology for the VidPN source.
