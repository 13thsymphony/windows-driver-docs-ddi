# _D3DKMT_DESTROYALLOCATION2 structure



## -description
The <b>D3DKMT_DESTROYALLOCATION2</b> structure describes parameters for releasing allocations with <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtdestroyallocation2.md">D3DKMTDestroyAllocation2</a>.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _D3DKMT_DESTROYALLOCATION2 {
  D3DKMT_HANDLE                    hDevice;
  D3DKMT_HANDLE                    hResource;
  const D3DKMT_HANDLE              *phAllocationList;
  UINT                             AllocationCount;
  D3DDDICB_DESTROYALLOCATION2FLAGS Flags;
} D3DKMT_DESTROYALLOCATION2;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field hDevice

[in] A <b>D3DKMT_HANDLE</b> data type that represents a kernel-mode handle to the device that the resource, allocations, or both are associated with.


### -field hResource

[in] A <b>D3DKMT_HANDLE</b> data type that represents a kernel-mode handle to the resource that is associated with the allocations when releasing a resource. If a resource handle is specified, all of the allocations that are associated with it are automatically released.


### -field phAllocationList

[in] An array of <b>D3DKMT_HANDLE</b> data types that represent kernel-mode handles to the allocations. If any allocation in the list is associated with a resource, all of the allocations in the list must also be associated with the same resource. If the OpenGL installable client driver sets the handle in the <b>hResource</b> member to a non-<b>NULL</b> value, the installable client driver must set <b>phAllocationList</b> to <b>NULL</b>.


### -field AllocationCount

[in] The number of allocations in the array that <b>phAllocationList</b> specifies. If the OpenGL installable client driver sets the handle in the <b>hResource</b> member to a non-<b>NULL</b> value, the <b>AllocationCount</b> member is ignored by the OpenGL runtime.


### -field Flags

[in] A <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn906318">D3DDDICB_DESTROYALLOCATION2FLAGS</a> structure that contains additional details about the operation.
