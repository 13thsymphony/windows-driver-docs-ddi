# D3DKMTOpenAdapterFromGdiDisplayName function



## -description
The <b>D3DKMTOpenAdapterFromGdiDisplayName</b> function maps a GDI device name to a graphics adapter handle and, if the adapter contains multiple monitor outputs, to one of those outputs.



## -syntax

````
NTSTATUS D3DKMTOpenAdapterFromGdiDisplayName(
  _Inout_ D3DKMT_OPENADAPTERFROMGDIDISPLAYNAME *pData
);
````


## -parameters

### -param pData [in, out]

 A pointer to a <a href="display.d3dkmt_openadapterfromgdidisplayname">D3DKMT_OPENADAPTERFROMGDIDISPLAYNAME</a> structure that describes the parameters that are required to perform the mapping.


## -returns
<b>D3DKMTOpenAdapterFromGdiDisplayName</b>
       returns one of the following values:
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>The mapping was performed successfully.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</b></dt>
</dl>Parameters were validated and determined to be incorrect or the Windows Vista display driver model was not used.

 

This function might also return other <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557697">NTSTATUS values</a>.

A graphics adapter corresponds to a video card. A monitor output corresponds to a head on a video card. A system with a single video card contains only one adapter. However, if the video card supports multiple heads, it supports outputting to multiple monitors.
