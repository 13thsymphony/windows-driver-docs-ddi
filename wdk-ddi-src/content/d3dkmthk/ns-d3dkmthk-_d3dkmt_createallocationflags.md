# _D3DKMT_CREATEALLOCATIONFLAGS structure
The D3DKMT_CREATEALLOCATIONFLAGS structure identifies how to create an allocation in a call to the <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nc-d3dkmthk-pfnd3dkmt_createallocation.md">D3DKMTCreateAllocation</a> function.

## Syntax
````

  UINT CreateResource  :1;
  UINT CreateShared  :1;
  UINT NonSecure  :1;
  UINT CreateProtected  :1;
  UINT RestrictSharedAccess  :1;
  UINT ExistingSysMem  :1;

## Members


`CreateCached`

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member is equivalent to setting the eighth bit of a 32-bit value (0x00000200).

Supported starting with Windows 8.

`CreateProtected`

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member is equivalent to setting the fourth bit of a 32-bit value (0x00000008).

Supported starting with Windows 7.

`CreateResource`

A UINT value that specifies whether to create a device-specific resource.

If you set <b>CreateShared</b>, you must also set <b>CreateResource</b>.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of a 32-bit value (0x00000001).

`CreateShared`

A UINT value that specifies whether to create a resource shared across all devices. 

If you set <b>CreateShared</b>, you must also set <b>CreateResource</b>.

For more information on using <b>CreateShared</b>, see the Remarks section.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the second bit of a 32-bit value (0x00000002).

`CreateWriteCombined`

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member is equivalent to setting the seventh bit of a 32-bit value (0x00000100).

Supported starting with Windows 8.

`CrossAdapter`



`ExistingSection`



`ExistingSysMem`

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member is equivalent to setting the sixth bit of a 32-bit value (0x00000020).

Supported starting with Windows 7.

`NonSecure`

A UINT value that specifies whether to create an allocation that can be opened by any process. If <b>NonSecure</b> is set, secure and non-secure processes can open the allocation.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the third bit of a 32-bit value (0x00000004).

`NtSecuritySharing`

A UINT value that specifies whether the allocation is shared with an NT handle, meaning that it  does not have a global <b>D3DKMT_HANDLE</b> kernel-mode handle to the resource.

If <b>NtSecuritySharing</b> is set to 1 (<b>TRUE</b>), the allocation is shared using the <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtshareobjects.md">D3DKMTShareObjects</a> function but does not have a global <b>D3DKMT_HANDLE</b> handle to the resource.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  If <b>NtSecuritySharing</b> is set to 1,  <b>CreateShared</b>  must be set to 1.</div>
<div> </div>
For more information on using <b>NtSecuritySharing</b>, see the Remarks section.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the seventh bit of a 32-bit value (0x00000040).

Supported starting with Windows 8.

`OpenCrossAdapter`



`PartialSharedCreation`



`ReadOnly`

A UINT value that specifies whether the allocation can only be read from.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the eighth bit of a 32-bit value (0x00000080).

Supported starting with Windows 8.

`RestrictSharedAccess`

A UINT value that specifies whether to create a resource shared across all devices but with some restrictions.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the fifth bit of a 32-bit value (0x00000010).

Supported starting with Windows 7.

`StandardAllocation`



`SwapChainBackBuffer`

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member is equivalent to setting the seventh bit of a 32-bit value (0x00000100).

Supported starting with Windows 8.

`WriteWatch`



`Zeroed`



## Remarks
Objects to be shared by using the <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtshareobjects.md">D3DKMTShareObjects</a> function must first be created with the <b>NtSecuritySharing</b> flag value set. This flag value is available in the <b>D3DKMT_CREATEALLOCATIONFLAGS</b>, <a href="..\d3dkmthk\ns-d3dkmthk-_d3dkmt_createkeyedmutex2_flags.md">D3DKMT_CREATEKEYEDMUTEX2_FLAGS</a>, and <a href="..\d3dukmdt\ns-d3dukmdt-_d3dddi_synchronizationobject_flags.md">D3DDDI_SYNCHRONIZATIONOBJECT_FLAGS</a> structures.

Drivers should follow these guidelines on <b>D3DKMT_CREATEALLOCATIONFLAGS</b> sharing flags:

<ul>
<li>If the allocation is not shared, set both  <b>CreateShared</b> and <b>NtSecuritySharing</b> to 0.</li>
<li>If the allocation is shared with a <b>D3DKMT_HANDLE</b> data type, set <b>CreateShared</b> = 1 and <b>NtSecuritySharing</b> = 0.</li>
<li>If the allocation is shared with an NT handle to the process (and without a global <b>D3DKMT_HANDLE</b> kernel-mode handle to the resource), set <b>CreateShared</b> = 1 and <b>NtSecuritySharing</b> = 1.</li>
</ul>
