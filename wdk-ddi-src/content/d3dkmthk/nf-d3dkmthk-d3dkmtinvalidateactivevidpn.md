# D3DKMTInvalidateActiveVidPn function
The <b>D3DKMTInvalidateActiveVidPn</b> function invalidates the active video present network (VidPN) currently in use.


<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    This function is obsolete in Windows 7 and later versions of the Windows operating systems.</div>
<div> </div>

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS D3DKMTInvalidateActiveVidPn(
  _In_ const D3DKMT_INVALIDATEACTIVEVIDPN *pData
);
````

## Parameters

`D3DKMT_INVALIDATEACTIVEVIDPN`

TBD


## Return Value

<b>D3DKMTInvalidateActiveVidPn</b> returns one of the following values:

<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>

<td width="40%">

<dt><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>

</table>
 

This function might also return other NTSTATUS values.

## Remarks

When the <b>D3DKMTInvalidateActiveVidPn</b> function is called to invalidate the VidPN currently in use, the current VidPN is replaced with a new VidPN that the display miniport driver recommends. Because the display miniport driver must recommend a new VidPN, the display miniport driver must be able to determine the display mode that the OpenGL ICD requires from the buffer pointed to by the <b>pPrivateDriverData</b> member of <a href="..\d3dkmthk\ns-d3dkmthk-_d3dkmt_invalidateactivevidpn.md">D3DKMT_INVALIDATEACTIVEVIDPN</a>.

The OpenGL ICD can call <b>D3DKMTInvalidateActiveVidPn</b> for display modes (for example, clone-view mode) that are not supported by using the more general call to the <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtsetdisplaymode.md">D3DKMTSetDisplayMode</a> function.
