# _D3DKMT_WAITFORSYNCHRONIZATIONOBJECT structure
The D3DKMT_WAITFORSYNCHRONIZATIONOBJECT structure contains information about the synchronization events that the <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtwaitforsynchronizationobject.md">D3DKMTWaitForSynchronizationObject</a> function waits for to occur.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DKMT_WAITFORSYNCHRONIZATIONOBJECT {
  D3DKMT_HANDLE hContext;
  UINT          ObjectCount;
  D3DKMT_HANDLE ObjectHandleArray[D3DDDI_MAX_OBJECT_WAITED_ON];
} D3DKMT_WAITFORSYNCHRONIZATIONOBJECT;
````

## Members


`hContext`

[in] A kernel-mode handle to the context stream in which a wait for the synchronization events in the array that the <b>ObjectHandleArray</b> member specifies is inserted.

`ObjectCount`

[in] The number of synchronization events in the <b>ObjectHandleArray</b> array.

`ObjectHandleArray`

[in] An array of kernel-mode handles to the synchronization events that the context that is specified by the <b>hContext</b> member waits for. The D3DDDI_MAX_OBJECT_WAITED_ON constant, which is defined as 32, indicates the maximum number of synchronization events that the context can wait for.
