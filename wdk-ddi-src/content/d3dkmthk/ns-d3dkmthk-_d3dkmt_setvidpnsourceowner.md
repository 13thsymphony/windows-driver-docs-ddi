# _D3DKMT_SETVIDPNSOURCEOWNER structure
The D3DKMT_SETVIDPNSOURCEOWNER structure describes the parameters for setting or releasing the video present source in the path of a video present network (VidPN) topology that owns the VidPN.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DKMT_SETVIDPNSOURCEOWNER {
  D3DKMT_HANDLE                        hDevice;
  const D3DKMT_VIDPNSOURCEOWNER_TYPE   *pType;
  const D3DDDI_VIDEO_PRESENT_SOURCE_ID *pVidPnSourceId;
  UINT                                 VidPnSourceCount;
} D3DKMT_SETVIDPNSOURCEOWNER;
````

## Members


`hDevice`

[in] A D3DKMT_HANDLE data type that represents a kernel-mode handle to the device that acquires or releases the VidPN source owner.

`pType`

[in] An array of owner types. Elements of the array can contain the following values from the D3DKMT_VIDPNSOURCEOWNER_TYPE enumeration type.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DKMT_VIDPNSOURCEOWNER_UNOWNED (0)

</td>
<td>
No owner, or GDI is the owner.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DKMT_VIDPNSOURCEOWNER_SHARED (1)

</td>
<td>
A shared owner. That is, the owner can yield to any exclusive owner. This type is not available to legacy devices.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DKMT_VIDPNSOURCEOWNER_EXCLUSIVE (2)

</td>
<td>
An exclusive owner without shared GDI primary.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
D3DKMT_VIDPNSOURCEOWNER_EXCLUSIVEGDI (3)

</td>
<td>
An exclusive owner with shared GDI primary. This owner must exclusively own all of the VidPn sources. This type is available only to legacy devices.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`pVidPnSourceId`

[in] An array of zero-based identification numbers of the video present sources in paths of a video present network (VidPN) topology.

`VidPnSourceCount`

The number of valid entries in the array that <b>pVidPnSourceId</b> specifies.
