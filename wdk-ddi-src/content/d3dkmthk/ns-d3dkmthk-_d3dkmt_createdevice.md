## -struct-fields

### -field hAdapter

[in] A handle to the graphics adapter that the device context is created on. This handle identifies the adapter for user-mode creation. 


### -field pAdapter

[in] A pointer to a block of memory for the graphics adapter that the device context is created on. This pointer identifies the adapter for kernel-mode creation. 


### -field Flags

[in] A <a href="..\d3dkmthk\ns-d3dkmthk-_d3dkmt_createdeviceflags.md">D3DKMT_CREATEDEVICEFLAGS</a> structure that indicates, in bit-field flags, the type of device context to be created.


### -field hDevice

[out] A handle to the device context that the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem (<i>Dxgkrnl.sys</i>) supplied and that is returned from the call to the <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtcreatedevice.md">D3DKMTCreateDevice</a> function.


### -field pCommandBuffer

[out] A pointer to command buffer memory that the OpenGL ICD places commands into. The <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtcreatedevice.md">D3DKMTCreateDevice</a> function returns this memory pointer.


### -field CommandBufferSize

[out] The size, in bytes, of the memory block that <b>pCommandBuffer</b> points to. The <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtcreatedevice.md">D3DKMTCreateDevice</a> function returns this size value.


### -field pAllocationList

[out] An array of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544375">D3DDDI_ALLOCATIONLIST</a> structures that the OpenGL ICD inserts referenced allocations in.

The <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtcreatedevice.md">D3DKMTCreateDevice</a> function returns this value. 


### -field AllocationListSize

[out] The number of elements in the array of allocations that is pointed to by <b>pAllocationList</b>. This quantity of allocations is available when submitting the command buffer that is pointed to by <b>pCommandBuffer</b> to the display miniport driver. 

The <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtcreatedevice.md">D3DKMTCreateDevice</a> function returns this value. 


### -field pPatchLocationList

[out] An array of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544630">D3DDDI_PATCHLOCATIONLIST</a> structures that the OpenGL ICD inserts patching information in.

The <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtcreatedevice.md">D3DKMTCreateDevice</a> function returns this value. 


### -field PatchLocationListSize

[out] The number of elements in the patch-location list that is pointed to by <b>pPatchLocationList</b>. This quantity of patch locations is available when submitting the command buffer that is pointed to by <b>pCommandBuffer</b> to the display miniport driver. 

The <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtcreatedevice.md">D3DKMTCreateDevice</a> function returns this value.
