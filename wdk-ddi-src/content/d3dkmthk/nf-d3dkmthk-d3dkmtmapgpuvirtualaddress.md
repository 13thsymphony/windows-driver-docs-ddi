# D3DKMTMapGpuVirtualAddress function
<b>D3DKMTMapGpuVirtualAddress</b> maps a graphics processing unit (GPU) virtual address ranges to a specific allocation range or puts it to the Invalid or Zero state. The driver can specify a base GPU virtual address to map or let the video memory manager automatically pick one. 
When specifying a non-NULL base address, the entire range from <b>BaseAddress</b> to <b>BaseAddress</b>+<b>Size</b> must be in a freed state or belong to a virtual address range that was obtained by calling <b>MapGpuVirtualAddress</b> or <a href="..\d3dkmddi\nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkcb_reservegpuvirtualaddressrange.md">DxgkCbReserveGpuVirtualAddressRange</a>. Note that when <b>Protection.Zero</b> or <b>Protection.NoAccess</b> is specified, the virtual address range cannot belong to a range that was obtained by calling <b>MapGpuVirtualAddress</b>.
The driver may specify if the mapping should allow for write and execute privileges in addition to read privileges, which always exist by default. 
In the  linked display adapter configuration the paging queue defines a physical GPU, whose page tables are modified, and the allocation handle (if not NULL) defines where the page table entries are pointing to. The allocation can be resident in any physical GPU memory segment.
