# _D3DKMT_MULTISAMPLEMETHOD structure
The D3DKMT_MULTISAMPLEMETHOD structure describes a multiple-sampling method.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DKMT_MULTISAMPLEMETHOD {
  UINT NumSamples;
  UINT NumQualityLevels;
  UINT Reserved;
} D3DKMT_MULTISAMPLEMETHOD;
````

## Members


`NumQualityLevels`

[out] The upper bound on the quality range that is supported for the multiple-sampling method. The range extends from zero through the reported maximum quality setting.

`NumSamples`

[out] The number of subpixels that are used in the multiple-sampling method (for example, 2 for 2x and 8 for 8x multiple-sampling).

`Reserved`

[out] Reserved.

## Remarks
The driver can partition its quality levels for a given multiple-sampling method into as many increments as it requires, with the condition that each incremental step noticeably improves the quality of the presented image.

## Requirements
