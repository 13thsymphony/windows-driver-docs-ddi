# _D3DKMT_QUERYRESOURCEINFO structure
The D3DKMT_QUERYRESOURCEINFO structure describes parameters for retrieving information about a resource.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DKMT_QUERYRESOURCEINFO {
  D3DKMT_HANDLE hDevice;
  D3DKMT_HANDLE hGlobalShare;
  VOID          *pPrivateRuntimeData;
  UINT          PrivateRuntimeDataSize;
  UINT          TotalPrivateDriverDataSize;
  UINT          ResourcePrivateDriverDataSize;
  UINT          NumAllocations;
} D3DKMT_QUERYRESOURCEINFO;
````

## Members


`hDevice`

[in] A handle to the device that the resource and allocations are associated with.

`hGlobalShare`

[in] A handle to the shared resource to open.

`NumAllocations`

[out] The number of allocations that are associated with the resource.

`pPrivateRuntimeData`

[in] If non-<b>NULL</b>, a pointer to a buffer that receives the runtime-private data that is supplied at create time. The OpenGL ICD should first call the <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtqueryresourceinfo.md">D3DKMTQueryResourceInfo</a> function with <b>pPrivateRuntimeData</b> set to <b>NULL</b> to obtain the buffer size and then call again with the correct size buffer.

`PrivateRuntimeDataSize`

[in/out] The size, in bytes, of the buffer that <b>pPrivateRuntimeData</b> points to. If <b>pPrivateRuntimeData</b> is <b>NULL</b>, <b>PrivateRuntimeDataSize</b> is set to the size, in bytes, that is required for the buffer to store the runtime-private data.

`ResourcePrivateDriverDataSize`

[out] The size, in bytes, of the buffer that is required to hold the private driver data for the resource.

`TotalPrivateDriverDataSize`

[out] The size, in bytes, of the buffer that is required to hold the private driver data for all of the allocations that are associated with the resource.
