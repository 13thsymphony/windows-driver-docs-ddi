# D3DKMTOpenAdapterFromDeviceName function
The <b>D3DKMTOpenAdapterFromDeviceName</b> function maps a device name to a graphics adapter handle and, if the adapter contains multiple monitor outputs, to one of those outputs.

  _Inout_ D3DKMT_OPENADAPTERFROMDEVICENAME *pData
);
````

## Parameters

This function has no parameters.

## Remarks

A graphics adapter corresponds to a video card. A monitor output corresponds to a head on a video card. A system with a single video card contains only one adapter. However, if the video card supports multiple heads, it supports outputting to multiple monitors.
