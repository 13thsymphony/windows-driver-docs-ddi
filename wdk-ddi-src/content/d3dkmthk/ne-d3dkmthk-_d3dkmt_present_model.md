# _D3DKMT_PRESENT_MODEL Enumeration
The D3DKMT_PRESENT_MODEL enumeration type contains values that indicate the model for a present operation.

## Syntax
```
typedef enum _D3DKMT_PRESENT_MODEL {
  D3DKMT_PM_UNINITIALIZED           ,
  D3DKMT_PM_REDIRECTED_GDI          ,
  D3DKMT_PM_REDIRECTED_FLIP         ,
  D3DKMT_PM_REDIRECTED_BLT          ,
  D3DKMT_PM_REDIRECTED_VISTABLT     ,
  D3DKMT_PM_SCREENCAPTUREFENCE      ,
  D3DKMT_PM_REDIRECTED_GDI_SYSMEM   ,
  D3DKMT_PM_REDIRECTED_COMPOSITION  ,
  D3DKMT_PM_SURFACECOMPLETE
} D3DKMT_PRESENT_MODEL;
```
