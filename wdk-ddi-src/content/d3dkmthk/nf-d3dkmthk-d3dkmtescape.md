This function might also return other <b>NTSTATUS</b> values.

## Remarks

The OpenGL ICD calls <b>D3DKMTEscape</b> to exchange data directly with the display miniport driver. For testing purposes, the OpenGL ICD can also call <b>D3DKMTEscape</b> to control the video memory manager and graphics processing unit (GPU) scheduler (which are part of <i>Dxgkrnl.sys</i>) and the behavior of the operating system's Timeout Detection and Recovery (TDR) process. 

Hardware vendors can use <b>D3DKMTEscape</b> in their OpenGL ICDs as an extension mechanism. However, vendors should report necessary extensions to Microsoft so the extensions can be natively supported by the operating system.
