# _D3DKMT_SIGNALSYNCHRONIZATIONOBJECT structure
The D3DKMT_SIGNALSYNCHRONIZATIONOBJECT structure contains information about the synchronization events that the <a href="..\d3dkmthk\nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtsignalsynchronizationobject.md">D3DKMTSignalSynchronizationObject</a> function signals.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DKMT_SIGNALSYNCHRONIZATIONOBJECT {
  D3DKMT_HANDLE        hContext;
  UINT                 ObjectCount;
  D3DKMT_HANDLE        ObjectHandleArray[D3DDDI_MAX_OBJECT_SIGNALED];
  D3DDDICB_SIGNALFLAGS Flags;
} D3DKMT_SIGNALSYNCHRONIZATIONOBJECT;
````

## Members


`Flags`

[in] A <a href="..\d3dukmdt\ns-d3dukmdt-_d3dddicb_signalflags.md">D3DDDICB_SIGNALFLAGS</a> structure that indicates, in bit-field flags, signaling behavior.

`hContext`

[in] A kernel-mode handle to a context that signals the synchronization events in the array that the <b>ObjectHandleArray</b> member specifies.

`ObjectCount`

[in] The number of synchronization events in the <b>ObjectHandleArray</b> array.

`ObjectHandleArray`

[in] An array of kernel-mode handles to the synchronization events that the context that is specified by the <b>hContext</b> member signals. The D3DDDI_MAX_OBJECT_SIGNALED constant, which is defined as 32, indicates the maximum number of synchronization events that the context can signal.
