The D3DKMT_GETSHAREDPRIMARYHANDLE structure describes the parameters that are required to retrieve the global shared handle for the primary surface.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _D3DKMT_GETSHAREDPRIMARYHANDLE {
  D3DKMT_HANDLE                  hAdapter;
  D3DDDI_VIDEO_PRESENT_SOURCE_ID VidPnSourceId;
  D3DKMT_HANDLE                  hSharedPrimary;
} D3DKMT_GETSHAREDPRIMARYHANDLE;
````

## Members
