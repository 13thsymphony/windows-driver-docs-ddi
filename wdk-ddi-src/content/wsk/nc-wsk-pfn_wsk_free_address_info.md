# PFN_WSK_FREE_ADDRESS_INFO callback function
The 
  <b>WskFreeAddressInfo</b> function frees address information that the 
  <a href="..\wsk\nc-wsk-pfn_wsk_get_address_info.md">WskGetAddressInfo</a> function has dynamically
  allocated.

## Syntax

```
PFN_WSK_FREE_ADDRESS_INFO PfnWskFreeAddressInfo;

void PfnWskFreeAddressInfo(
  PWSK_CLIENT Client,
  PADDRINFOEXW AddrInfo
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Client`

[in] A pointer to a 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff571155">WSK_CLIENT</a> structure that was returned through
     the 
     <i>WskProviderNpi</i> parameter of the 
     <a href="..\wsk\nf-wsk-wskcaptureprovidernpi.md">
     WskCaptureProviderNPI</a> function.

`AddrInfo`

[in] A pointer to a linked list of one or more <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/1077e03d-a1a4-45ab-a5d2-29a67e03f5df">ADDRINFOEXW</a> structures that contain response
     information about the host. This pointer was returned through the 
     <i>Result</i> parameter of the 
     <a href="..\wsk\nc-wsk-pfn_wsk_get_address_info.md">WskGetAddressInfo</a> function.
     

The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/1077e03d-a1a4-45ab-a5d2-29a67e03f5df">ADDRINFOEXW</a> structure is defined in the 
     Ws2def.h header file. It is identical to the 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/1077e03d-a1a4-45ab-a5d2-29a67e03f5df">addrinfoex</a> structure.
