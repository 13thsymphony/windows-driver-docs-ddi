# _WSK_TRANSPORT structure
The WSK_TRANSPORT structure specifies an available transport that is supported by the WSK
  subsystem.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct _WSK_TRANSPORT {
  USHORT         Version;
  USHORT         SocketType;
  ULONG          Protocol;
  ADDRESS_FAMILY AddressFamily;
  GUID           ProviderId;
} WSK_TRANSPORT, *PWSK_TRANSPORT;
```

## Members


`Version`

The version of the transport. The format of the version number is transport-specific.

`SocketType`

The type of socket that is supported by the transport. This member can be one of the following:
     





#### SOCK_STREAM

Supports reliable connection-oriented byte stream communication.



#### SOCK_DGRAM

Supports unreliable connectionless datagram communication.



#### SOCK_RAW

Supports raw access to the transport protocol.

For more information about the socket types that are supported for each supported address family, see
     
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff571151">WSK Address Families</a>.

`Protocol`

The protocol that is supported by the transport. For more information about the protocols that are
     supported for each supported address family, see 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff571151">WSK Address Families</a>.

`AddressFamily`

The address family that is supported by the transport. For more information about supported
     address families, see 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff571151">WSK Address Families</a>.

`ProviderId`

The identifier of the transport provider that implements the transport.

## Remarks
A WSK application passes a pointer to an array of WSK_TRANSPORT structures to the 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff571126">WskControlClient</a> function when specifying
    the 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff571195">WSK_TRANSPORT_LIST_QUERY</a> control
    code. The WSK subsystem fills in the array with the list of available transports that can be used for
    socket communication. When a WSK application calls the 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff571149">WskSocket</a> or 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff571150">WskSocketConnect</a> function to create a new
    socket, it can pass the values contained in the 
    <b>AddressFamily</b>, 
    <b>SocketType</b>, and 
    <b>Protocol</b> members of a returned WSK_TRANSPORT structure for the 
    <i>AddressFamily</i>, 
    <i>SocketType</i>, and 
    <i>Protocol</i> parameters.

A single transport provider can support multiple combinations of values for the 
    <b>AddressFamily</b>, 
    <b>SocketType</b>, and 
    <b>Protocol</b> members.
