# _WSK_DATA_INDICATION structure
The WSK_DATA_INDICATION structure describes data that has been received on a connection-oriented
  socket.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _WSK_DATA_INDICATION {
  struct _WSK_DATA_INDICATION  *Next;
  WSK_BUF                     Buffer;
} WSK_DATA_INDICATION, *PWSK_DATA_INDICATION;
````

## Members


`_WSK_DATA_INDICATION`



`Buffer`

A WSK_BUF structure that describes the data that has been received on the socket.

`Next`

A pointer to the next WSK_DATA_INDICATION structure in a linked list of WSK_DATA_INDICATION
     structures. If this member is <b>NULL</b>, this structure is the last WSK_DATA_INDICATION structure in the
     linked list.

## Remarks
The WSK subsystem passes a pointer to a WSK_DATA_INDICATION structure as the 
    <i>DataIndication</i> parameter when it calls a connection-oriented socket's 
    <a href="..\wsk\nc-wsk-pfn_wsk_receive_event.md">WskReceiveEvent</a> event callback
    function.

## Requirements

| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows Driver kit version** |  |
| **Minimum KMDF version** |  |
| **Minimum UMDF version** |  |
| **Header** | wsk.h (include Wsk.h) |
