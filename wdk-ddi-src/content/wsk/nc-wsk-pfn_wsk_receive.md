# PFN_WSK_RECEIVE callback function
The 
  <b>WskReceive</b> function receives data over a connection-oriented or stream socket from a remote transport
  address.

## Syntax

```
PFN_WSK_RECEIVE PfnWskReceive;

NTSTATUS PfnWskReceive(
  PWSK_SOCKET Socket,
  PWSK_BUF Buffer,
  ULONG Flags,
  PIRP Irp
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Socket`

A pointer to a 
     <a href="..\wsk\ns-wsk-_wsk_socket.md">WSK_SOCKET</a> structure that specifies the socket
     object for the socket from which to receive the data.

`Buffer`

A pointer to an initialized 
     <a href="..\wsk\ns-wsk-_wsk_buf.md">WSK_BUF</a> structure that describes the data buffer
     that receives the data from the socket.

`Flags`

A ULONG value that contains a bitwise OR of a combination of the following flags:
     



The WSK_FLAG_WAITALL and WSK_FLAG_DRAIN flags are mutually exclusive. A WSK application should not
     specify both of these flags at the same time.

`Irp`

A pointer to a caller-allocated IRP that the WSK subsystem uses to complete the receive operation
     asynchronously. For more information about using IRPs with WSK functions, see 
     <mshelp:link keywords="netvista.using_irps_with_winsock_kernel_functions" tabindex="0">Using IRPs with Winsock
     Kernel Functions</mshelp:link>.


## Return Value

<b>WskReceive</b> returns one of the following NTSTATUS codes:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Data was successfully received from the socket. The IRP will be completed with success status.
       The 
       <b>IoStatus.Information</b> field of the IRP contains the number of bytes that were received.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_PENDING</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The WSK subsystem could not receive the data from the socket immediately. The WSK subsystem will
       complete the IRP after it has received the data from the socket. The status of the receive operation
       will be returned in the 
       <b>IoStatus.Status</b> field of the IRP. If the operation succeeds, the 
       <b>IoStatus.Information</b> field of the IRP will contain the number of bytes that were
       received.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_FILE_FORCED_CLOSED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The socket is no longer functional. The IRP will be completed with failure status. The WSK
       application must call the 
       <a href="..\wsk\nc-wsk-pfn_wsk_close_socket.md">WskCloseSocket</a> function to close the
       socket as soon as possible.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
A specified flag is not supported by the underlying network transport.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>Other status codes</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
An error occurred. The IRP will be completed with failure status.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

A WSK application can call the 
    <b>WskReceive</b> function only on a connection-oriented or stream socket that has been previously connected to a
    remote transport address. A connection-oriented socket is connected to a remote transport address by one
    of the following methods:
<ul>
<li>
The WSK application connects the socket by calling the 
      <a href="..\wsk\nc-wsk-pfn_wsk_connect.md">WskConnect</a> function.

</li>
<li>
The WSK application creates, binds, and connects the socket by calling the 
      <a href="..\wsk\nc-wsk-pfn_wsk_socket_connect.md">WskSocketConnect</a> function.

</li>
<li>
The WSK subsystem connects the socket when the WSK application accepts an incoming connection
      request on a listening socket.

</li>
</ul>If a WSK application's 
    <a href="..\wsk\nc-wsk-pfn_wsk_receive_event.md">WskReceiveEvent</a> event callback function is
    enabled on a connection-oriented socket and the application also has a pending call to the 
    <b>WskReceive</b> function on the same connection-oriented socket, then, when data arrives, the pending
    call to the 
    <b>WskReceive</b> function will take precedence over the 
    <i>WskReceiveEvent</i> event callback function. The WSK subsystem calls the application's 
    <i>WskReceiveEvent</i> event callback function only if there are no IRPs queued from pending calls to the 
    <b>WskReceive</b> function. However, a WSK application should not assume that the WSK subsystem will not
    call the application's 
    <i>WskReceiveEvent</i> event callback function for a connection-oriented socket that has a pending call to
    the 
    <b>WskReceive</b> function. Race conditions exist where the WSK subsystem could still call the WSK
    application's 
    <i>WskReceiveEvent</i> event callback function for the socket. The only way for a WSK application to
    ensure that the WSK subsystem will not call the application's 
    <i>WskReceiveEvent</i> event callback function for a connection-oriented socket is to disable the
    application's 
    <i>WskReceiveEvent</i> event callback function on the socket.

A WSK application can call the 
    <b>WskReceive</b> function with a zero length specified in the 
    <b>Length</b> member of the 
    <a href="..\wsk\ns-wsk-_wsk_buf.md">WSK_BUF</a> structure that is pointed to by the 
    <i>Buffer</i> parameter. Specifying a zero length in this member is useful in the following
    situations:
<ul>
<li>
When re-enabling the 
      <i>WskReceiveEvent</i> event callback function for a socket after the 
      <i>WskReceiveEvent</i> event callback function previously returned STATUS_DATA_NOT_ACCEPTED

</li>
<li>
When specifying the WSK_FLAG_DRAIN flag to discard any additional data that is received on the
      socket

</li>
</ul>If the 
    <b>WskReceive</b> function returns STATUS_PENDING, the MDL chain that is described in the WSK_BUF
    structure that is pointed to by the 
    <i>Buffer</i> parameter must remain locked in memory until the IRP is completed.
