# KeSetSystemAffinityThreadEx function



## -description
The <b>KeSetSystemAffinityThreadEx</b> routine sets the system affinity of the current thread.


## -syntax

````
KAFFINITY KeSetSystemAffinityThreadEx(
  _In_ KAFFINITY Affinity
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Affinity [in]

A <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551830">KAFFINITY</a>-typed variable that specifies the new system affinity of the current thread.

## -returns
<b>KeSetSystemAffinityThreadEx</b> returns either the previous system affinity of the current thread, or zero to indicate that there was no previous system affinity.

## -remarks
<b>KeSetSystemAffinityThreadEx</b> changes the affinity mask of the current thread. The affinity mask identifies a set of processors on which the thread can run. If successful, the routine schedules the thread to run on a processor in this set.

Callers of <b>KeSetSystemAffinityThreadEx</b> should save the return value and later pass this value to the <b>KeRevertToUserAffinityThreadEx</b> routine to restore the previous affinity mask.

In a multiprocessor system, a kernel-mode driver routine that runs in the context of a user-mode thread might need to call <b>KeSetSystemAffinityThreadEx</b> to temporarily change the affinity mask of the thread. Before the routine exits, it should call <b>KeRevertToUserAffinityThreadEx</b> to restore the affinity mask of the thread to its original value.

The term <i>user affinity</i> refers to the original affinity of the user-mode thread. The affinity that is set by the kernel-mode driver is referred to as the <i>system affinity</i>. If a call to <b>KeSetSystemAffinityThreadEx</b> replaces the user affinity of a thread with a system affinity, the call returns zero. Later, the driver restores the user affinity by calling <b>KeRevertToUserAffinityThreadEx</b> and passing this return value (zero) as the <i>Affinity</i> value.

Additionally, a kernel-mode driver routine that requires a particular affinity mask might call another kernel-mode routine that requires a different affinity mask. Each routine can call <b>KeSetSystemAffinityThreadEx</b> to set a new affinity mask and then call <b>KeRevertToUserAffinityThreadEx</b> to restore the previous affinity mask before returning.

The <b>KeSetSystemAffinityThreadEx</b> routine changes the affinity mask of the current thread to the <i>Affinity</i> value only if both of the following are true:

The <i>Affinity</i> value is valid (that is, only mask bits that correspond to logical processors are set).

At least one of the processors that is specified in the <i>Affinity</i> value is active.

If either of these conditions is not met, the call to <b>KeSetSystemAffinityThreadEx</b> has no effect.

Windows 7 and later versions of Windows support processor groups. Drivers that are designed to handle information about processor groups should use the <a href="kernel.kesetsystemgroupaffinitythread">KeSetSystemGroupAffinityThread</a> routine, which specifies a processor group, instead of <b>KeSetSystemAffinityThreadEx</b>, which does not. However, the implementation of <b>KeSetSystemAffinityThreadEx</b> in Windows 7 and later versions of Windows provides compatibility for drivers that were written for earlier versions of Windows, which do not support processor groups. In this implementation, <b>KeSetSystemAffinityThreadEx</b> assigns the thread to group 0, and uses the affinity mask to specify a set of logical processors in this group on which the thread can run. The routine returns the previous group-relative affinity mask, but not the previous group.

If <b>KeSetSystemAffinityThreadEx</b> is called at IRQL &lt;= APC_LEVEL and the call is successful, the new affinity mask takes effect immediately. When the call returns, the calling thread is already running on a processor that is specified in the new affinity mask. If <b>KeSetSystemAffinityThreadEx</b> is called at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL and the call is successful, the pending processor change is deferred until the caller lowers the IRQL below DISPATCH_LEVEL.
