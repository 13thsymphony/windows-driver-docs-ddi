## -struct-fields

### -field CorrectableErrorReceived

A single bit that indicates that a correctable error message has been received.


### -field MultipleCorrectableErrorsReceived

A single bit that indicates that multiple correctable error messages have been received.


### -field UncorrectableErrorReceived

A single bit that indicates that an uncorrectable error message has been received.


### -field MultipleUncorrectableErrorsReceived

A single bit that indicates that multiple uncorrectable error messages have been received.


### -field FirstUncorrectableFatal

A single bit that indicates that the first uncorrectable error message that was received was for a fatal error.


### -field NonFatalErrorMessagesReceived

A single bit that indicates that one or more non-fatal uncorrectable error messages have been received.


### -field FatalErrorMessagesReceived

A single bit that indicates that one or more non-fatal uncorrectable error messages have been received.


### -field Reserved

Reserved.


### -field AdvancedErrorInterruptMessageNumber

The MSI/MSI-X vector that is used for the interrupt messages that are generated in association with any of the status bits of the advanced error reporting capability.


### -field AsULONG

A ULONG representation of the contents of the PCI_EXPRESS_ROOT_ERROR_STATUS structure.


## -remarks
The PCI_EXPRESS_ROOT_ERROR_STATUS structure is available in Windows Server 2008 and later versions of Windows.
