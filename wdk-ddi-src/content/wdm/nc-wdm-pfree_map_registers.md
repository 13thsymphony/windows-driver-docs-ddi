# PFREE_MAP_REGISTERS callback function
The <b>FreeMapRegisters</b> routine releases a set of map registers that were saved from a call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540573">AllocateAdapterChannel</a>.

## Syntax

```
PFREE_MAP_REGISTERS PfreeMapRegisters;

void PfreeMapRegisters(
  PDMA_ADAPTER DmaAdapter,
  PVOID MapRegisterBase,
  ULONG NumberOfMapRegisters
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`DmaAdapter`

Pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544062">DMA_ADAPTER</a> structure returned by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549220">IoGetDmaAdapter</a> that represents the bus-master adapter or DMA controller.

`MapRegisterBase`

Specifies the map registers allocated for the DMA operation.  The system passes this value  to the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540504">AdapterControl</a> routine.

`NumberOfMapRegisters`

Specifies the number of map registers to be released. This value must match the number specified in an earlier call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540573">AllocateAdapterChannel</a>.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

<b>FreeMapRegisters</b>
           is not a system routine that can be called directly by name. This routine is only callable by pointer from the address returned in a 
          <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544071">DMA_OPERATIONS</a>
           structure. Drivers obtain the address of this routine by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549220">IoGetDmaAdapter</a>.

When the driver of a bus-master device has completed the current packet-based DMA transfer request, it calls <b>FreeMapRegisters</b> to release the map registers previously allocated by a call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540573">AllocateAdapterChannel</a> and retained because its <i>AdapterControl</i> routine returned <b>DeallocateObjectKeepRegisters</b>. The driver must call <b>FreeMapRegisters</b> after calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545917">FlushAdapterBuffers</a>.
