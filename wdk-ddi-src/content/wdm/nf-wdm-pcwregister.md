# PcwRegister function
The <b>PcwRegister</b> function registers the caller as a provider of the specified counter set.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS PcwRegister(
  _Out_ PPCW_REGISTRATION             *Registration,
  _In_  PPCW_REGISTRATION_INFORMATION Info
);
````

## Parameters

`Registration`

A pointer to a PCW_REGISTRATION structure. Receives the handle to the newly allocated registration. The pointer is referenced before the function returns. The caller is responsible to dereference the pointer.

`Info`

A pointer to a PCW_REGISTRATION_INFORMATION structure that contains the details about the counter set being registered.


## Return Value

This function returns one of the following values:
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>The counter set is successfully registered.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER_2</b></dt>
</dl>The <i>Version</i> specified by <i>Info</i> does not match the supported value for this version of Windows.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INTEGER_OVERFLOW</b></dt>
</dl>The number of the counters exposed by this registration exceeds the space available.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_NO_MEMORY</b></dt>
</dl>There is not enough space available to allocate memory for the counters

## Remarks

The provider calls this function to create a new registration. The registration is added to the counter set's registration list. All the input arguments are captured so that the caller does not have to keep a copy of them.
