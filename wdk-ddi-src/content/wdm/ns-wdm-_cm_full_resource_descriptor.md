# _CM_FULL_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR structure
The <b>CM_FULL_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure specifies a set of system hardware resources of various types, assigned to a device that is connected to a specific bus. This structure is contained within a <a href="..\wudfwdm\ns-wudfwdm-_cm_resource_list.md">CM_RESOURCE_LIST</a> structure.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _CM_FULL_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR {
  INTERFACE_TYPE           InterfaceType;
  ULONG                    BusNumber;
  CM_PARTIAL_RESOURCE_LIST PartialResourceList;
} CM_FULL_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR, *PCM_FULL_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR;
````

## Members


`InterfaceType`

Specifies the type of bus to which the device is connected. This must be one of the types defined by <a href="..\wudfwdm\ne-wudfwdm-_interface_type.md">INTERFACE_TYPE</a>, in Wdm.h or Ntddk.h. (Not used by WDM drivers.)

`BusNumber`

The system-assigned, driver-supplied, zero-based number of the bus to which the device is connected. (Not used by WDM drivers.)

`PartialResourceList`

A <a href="..\wudfwdm\ns-wudfwdm-_cm_partial_resource_list.md">CM_PARTIAL_RESOURCE_LIST</a> structure.
