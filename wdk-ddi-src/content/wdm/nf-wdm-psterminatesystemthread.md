# PsTerminateSystemThread function
The <b>PsTerminateSystemThread</b> routine terminates the current system thread.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS PsTerminateSystemThread(
  _In_ NTSTATUS ExitStatus
);
````

## Parameters

`ExitStatus`

Specifies the status of the terminating system thread.


## Return Value

<b>PsTerminateSystemThread</b> does not return if it successfully terminates the calling thread. If the routine cannot terminate the thread (for example, if the thread is not a system thread), the routine returns an error NTSTATUS value.

## Remarks

A system thread calls <b>PsTerminateSystemThread</b> to terminate itself. A driver that creates its own threads must ensure that each such thread terminates. The driver must not terminate any threads that the system or other drivers created.
