# ExAcquireRundownProtectionEx function
The <b>ExAcquireRundownProtectionEx</b> routine tries to acquire run-down protection on a shared object so the caller can safely access the object.

## Syntax

````
BOOLEAN ExAcquireRundownProtectionEx(
  _Inout_ PEX_RUNDOWN_REF RunRef,
  _In_    ULONG           Count
);
````

## Parameters

`RunRef`

A pointer to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj569379">EX_RUNDOWN_REF</a> structure that was initialized by a previous call to the  <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exinitializerundownprotection.md">ExInitializeRundownProtection</a> routine. The run-down protection routines use this structure to track the run-down status of the associated shared object. This structure is opaque to drivers.

`Count`

The amount by which to increment to the run-down instance count of the object. The count is incremented only if the routine returns <b>TRUE</b>. For more information, see Remarks


## Return Value

<b>ExAcquireRundownProtectionEx</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the routine successfully acquires run-down protection for the caller. Otherwise, it returns <b>FALSE</b>. A return value of <b>FALSE</b> indicates that the run down of the object has started and that the object must be treated as invalid.

## Remarks

To safely access a shared object, a driver calls <b>ExAcquireRundownProtectionEx</b> to acquire run-down protection on the object.

The <i>RunRef</i> parameter points to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj569379">EX_RUNDOWN_REF</a> structure that tracks the run-down status of the associated object. This status information includes a count of instances of run-down protection that are currently in effect on the object. The <b>ExAcquireRundownProtectionEx</b> and <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exreleaserundownprotectionex.md">ExReleaseRundownProtectionEx</a> routines increment and decrement this count by arbitrary amounts. Two related routines,  <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exacquirerundownprotection.md">ExAcquireRundownProtection</a> and <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exreleaserundownprotection.md">ExReleaseRundownProtection</a>, increment and decrement this count by one.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj569382">Run-Down Protection</a>.
