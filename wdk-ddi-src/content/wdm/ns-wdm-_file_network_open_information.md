# _FILE_NETWORK_OPEN_INFORMATION structure



## -description
The <b>FILE_NETWORK_OPEN_INFORMATION</b> structure is used as an argument to <a href="kernel.zwqueryinformationfile">ZwQueryInformationFile</a>. 



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _FILE_NETWORK_OPEN_INFORMATION {
  LARGE_INTEGER CreationTime;
  LARGE_INTEGER LastAccessTime;
  LARGE_INTEGER LastWriteTime;
  LARGE_INTEGER ChangeTime;
  LARGE_INTEGER AllocationSize;
  LARGE_INTEGER EndOfFile;
  ULONG         FileAttributes;
} FILE_NETWORK_OPEN_INFORMATION, *PFILE_NETWORK_OPEN_INFORMATION;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field CreationTime

Specifies the time that the file was created.


### -field LastAccessTime

Specifies the time that the file was last accessed.


### -field LastWriteTime

Specifies he time that the file was last written to.


### -field ChangeTime

Specifies the time that the file was last changed.


### -field AllocationSize

Specifies the file allocation size, in bytes. Usually, this value is a multiple of the sector or cluster size of the underlying physical device.


### -field EndOfFile

Specifies the absolute end-of-file position as a byte offset from the start of the file. <b>EndOfFile</b> specifies the byte offset to the end of the file. Because this value is zero-based, it actually refers to the first free byte in the file. In other words, <b>EndOfFile</b> is the offset to the byte immediately following the last valid byte in the file.


### -field FileAttributes

Specifies one or more FILE_ATTRIBUTE_<i>XXX</i> flags. For descriptions of these flags, see the documentation of the <b>GetFileAttributes</b> function in the Microsoft Windows SDK.


## -remarks
FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES access to the file is required to query this information.

Time values <b>CreationTime</b>, <b>LastAccessTime</b>, <b>LastWriteTime</b>, and <b>ChangeTime</b> are expressed in absolute system time format. Absolute system time is the number of 100-nanosecond intervals since the start of the year 1601 in the Gregorian calendar.

This structure must be aligned on a LONGLONG (8-byte) boundary.
