# RtlFindSetBitsAndClear function
The <b>RtlFindSetBitsAndClear</b> routine searches for a range of set bits of a requested size within a bitmap and clears all bits in the range when it has been located.

## Syntax

````
ULONG RtlFindSetBitsAndClear(
  _In_ PRTL_BITMAP BitMapHeader,
  _In_ ULONG       NumberToFind,
  _In_ ULONG       HintIndex
);
````

## Parameters

`BitMapHeader`

A pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563614">RTL_BITMAP</a> structure that describes the bitmap. This structure must have been initialized by the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-rtlinitializebitmap.md">RtlInitializeBitMap</a> routine.

`NumberToFind`

Specifies how many contiguous set bits will satisfy this request.

`HintIndex`

Specifies a zero-based bit position around which to start looking for a set bit range of the given size.


## Return Value

<b>RtlFindSetBitsAndClear</b> either returns the zero-based starting bit index for a set bit range of the requested size that it cleared, or it returns 0xFFFFFFFF if it cannot find such a range within the given bitmap variable.

## Remarks

For a successful call, the returned bit position is not necessarily equivalent to the given <i>HintIndex</i>. If necessary, <b>RtlFindSetBitsAndClear</b> searches the whole bitmap to locate a set bit range of the requested size. However, it starts searching for the requested range near <i>HintIndex</i>, so callers can clear such a range more quickly when they can supply appropriate hints about where to start looking.

Callers of <b>RtlFindSetBitsAndClear</b> must be running at IRQL &lt;= APC_LEVEL if the memory that contains the bitmap variable is pageable or the memory at <i>BitMapHeader</i> is pageable. Otherwise, <b>RtlFindSetBitsAndClear</b> can be called at any IRQL.

## Requirements
