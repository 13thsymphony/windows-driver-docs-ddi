# ASSERTMSG function
<b>ASSERTMSG</b> tests an expression. If the expression is false, it breaks into the kernel debugger and sends it the specified message.

## Syntax

```
void ASSERTMSG(
   msg,
   exp
);
```

## Parameters

`msg`

TBD

`exp`

TBD


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

<b>ASSERTMSG</b> is identical to <b>ASSERT</b>, except that it sends an additional message to the debugger.

This macro will only be included in your binary if your code is compiled in a Debug configuration. Once your driver is built, <b>ASSERTMSG</b> will work properly regardless of whether your driver is run on the checked build or on the free build of Windows. 

If <i>Expression</i> evaluates to <b>TRUE</b>, this routine has no effect.

If <i>Expression</i> evaluates to <b>FALSE</b>, a message is displayed in the Debugger Command window. The message contains the source-code string of <i>Expression</i>, as well as the path of the source-code file and the line number of the instruction that called the macro. In this event, <b>ASSERTMSG</b> can be ignored and the process or thread in which <b>ASSERTMSG</b> occurred can be terminated. Alternatively, the debugger can be used to analyze the situation or to edit memory. If <b>ASSERTMSG</b> is ignored, execution continues as if the <b>g (Go)</b> command was entered.
