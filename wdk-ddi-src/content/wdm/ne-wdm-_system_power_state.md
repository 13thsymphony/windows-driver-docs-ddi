# _SYSTEM_POWER_STATE enumeration



## -description
The <b>SYSTEM_POWER_STATE</b> enumeration type is used to indicate a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/bb30bc89-d1f2-4cb3-bcfb-fb76c69dba27">system power state</a>.



## -syntax

````
typedef enum _SYSTEM_POWER_STATE { 
  PowerSystemUnspecified  = 0,
  PowerSystemWorking      = 1,
  PowerSystemSleeping1    = 2,
  PowerSystemSleeping2    = 3,

## -enum-fields

### -field PowerSystemUnspecified

Indicates an unspecified system power state. 


### -field PowerSystemWorking

Indicates maximum system power, which corresponds to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564591">system working state S0</a>. 


### -field PowerSystemSleeping1

Indicates a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2fd883b5-4e89-4ce9-b75a-b821348ac860">system sleeping state</a> less than <b>PowerSystemWorking</b> and greater than <b>PowerSystemSleeping2</b>, which corresponds to system power state S1. 


### -field PowerSystemSleeping2

Indicates a system sleeping state less than <b>PowerSystemSleeping1</b> and greater than <b>PowerSystemSleeping3</b>, which corresponds to system power state S2. 


### -field PowerSystemSleeping3

Indicates a system sleeping state less than <b>PowerSystemSleeping2</b> and greater than <b>PowerSystemHibernate</b>, which corresponds to system power state S3. 


### -field PowerSystemHibernate

Indicates the lowest-powered sleeping state, which corresponds to system power state S4. 


### -field PowerSystemShutdown

Indicates the system is turned off, which corresponds to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564572">system shutdown state S5</a>. 


### -field PowerSystemMaximum

The number of system power state values for this enumeration type that represents actual power states. This value is the number of elements in the <b>DeviceState</b> member of the <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_device_capabilities.md">DEVICE_CAPABILITIES</a> structure for a device. The other system power state values are less than this value.


## -remarks
A power state indicates the level of power consumption—and thus the extent of computing activity—by the system or by a single device. The power manager sets the power state of the system as a whole, where the system power state is indicated by one of the values of the <b>SYSTEM_POWER_STATE</b> enumeration type. Device drivers set the power state of their individual devices, where the device power state is indicated by one of the values of the <a href="..\wudfddi\ne-wudfddi-_device_power_state.md">DEVICE_POWER_STATE</a> enumeration type.

For more information about system power states, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546941">Handling System Power State Requests</a> and for more information about device power states, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554397">Managing Power for Individual Devices</a>.
