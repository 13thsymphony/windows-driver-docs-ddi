# ExInterlockedInsertHeadList function
The <b>ExInterlockedInsertHeadList</b> routine atomically inserts an entry at the beginning of a doubly linked list of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554296">LIST_ENTRY</a> structures.

## Syntax

````
PLIST_ENTRY ExInterlockedInsertHeadList(
  _Inout_ PLIST_ENTRY ListHead,
  _Inout_ PLIST_ENTRY ListEntry,
  _Inout_ PKSPIN_LOCK Lock
);
````

## Parameters

`ListHead`

A pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554296">LIST_ENTRY</a> structure that serves as the list header.

`ListEntry`

A pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554296">LIST_ENTRY</a> structure that represents the entry to be inserted into the list.

`Lock`

A pointer to a <b>KSPIN_LOCK</b> structure that serves as the spin lock used to synchronize access to the list. The storage for the spin lock must be resident and must have been initialized by calling <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-keinitializespinlock.md">KeInitializeSpinLock</a>. You must use this spin lock only with the <b>ExInterlocked<i>Xxx</i>List</b> routines.


## Return Value

<b>ExInterlockedInsertHeadList</b> returns a pointer to the first entry of the list <u>before</u> the new entry was inserted. If the list was empty, the routine returns <b>NULL</b>.

## Remarks

<b>ExInterlockedInsertHeadList</b> performs the same operation as <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-insertheadlist.md">InsertHeadList</a>, but atomically. Do not mix atomic and non-atomic calls on the same list.

For more information about using this routine to implement a doubly linked list, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563802">Singly and Doubly Linked Lists</a>.

The <b>ExInterlockedInsertHeadList</b> routine can be called at any IRQL. The storage for the <i>ListHead</i> parameter and the list entries must be resident at all IRQLs.
