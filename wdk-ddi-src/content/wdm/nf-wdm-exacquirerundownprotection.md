# ExAcquireRundownProtection function
The <b>ExAcquireRundownProtection</b> routine tries to acquire run-down protection on a shared object so the caller can safely access the object.

## Syntax

````
BOOLEAN ExAcquireRundownProtection(
  _Inout_ PEX_RUNDOWN_REF RunRef
);
````

## Parameters

`RunRef`

A pointer to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj569379">EX_RUNDOWN_REF</a> structure that was initialized by a previous call to the  <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exinitializerundownprotection.md">ExInitializeRundownProtection</a> routine. The run-down protection routines use this structure to track the run-down status of the associated shared object. This structure is opaque to drivers.


## Return Value

<b>ExAcquireRundownProtection</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the routine successfully acquires run-down protection for the caller. Otherwise, it returns <b>FALSE</b>. A return value of <b>FALSE</b> indicates that the run down of the object has started and that the object must be treated as invalid.

## Remarks

To safely access a shared object, a driver calls <b>ExAcquireRundownProtection</b> to acquire run-down protection on the object. The routine returns <b>TRUE</b> to indicate that run-down  protection is in effect. When run-down protection is in effect, the driver can safely access the object without risk that the object will be deleted before the access completes.

After completing the access, the driver calls <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exreleaserundownprotection.md">ExReleaseRundownProtection</a> to release the previously acquired run-down protection.

If <b>ExAcquireRundownProtection</b> returns <b>FALSE</b>, the object is no longer accessible. For example, if the object is to be replaced with a new one, the caller must wait for the object owner to create the new object, and then negotiate access to the new object.
