# IoGetDeviceNumaNode function
The <b>IoGetDeviceNumaNode</b> routine gets the node number of a device.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS IoGetDeviceNumaNode(
  _In_  PDEVICE_OBJECT Pdo,
  _Out_ PUSHORT        NodeNumber
);
````

## Parameters

`Pdo`

A pointer to a physical device object (PDO). This parameter points to a <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_device_object.md">DEVICE_OBJECT</a> structure that represents a physical device.

`NodeNumber`

A pointer to a location into which the routine writes the node number, if the node number is known.


## Return Value

<b>IoGetDeviceNumaNode</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call is successful. Possible error return values include the following:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_NOT_FOUND</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The node number of this device is unknown. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The <i>Pdo</i> parameter is <b>NULL</b> or does not point to a valid device object. 

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

In a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) multiprocessor architecture, a node is a collection of processors that share fast access to a region of memory. Memory access is non-uniform because a processor can access the memory in its node faster than it can access the memory in other nodes.

A device (for example, a network controller or storage controller) that is connected to a particular node can access the memory in this node faster than it can access the memory in other nodes. The <i>Pdo</i> parameter points to a PDO that represents the bus connection between the device and the node.

If a NUMA multiprocessor system contains <i>n</i> nodes, the nodes are numbered from 0 to <i>n</i>-1. To obtain the highest node number, call the <a href="..\ntddk\nf-ntddk-kequeryhighestnodenumber.md">KeQueryHighestNodeNumber</a> routine.

After the system is initialized, the node count remains fixed while the system continues to run. This count might include memory-only nodes, which are nodes that contain memory but no active logical processors. A node in which all the logical processors are inactive is effectively a memory-only node until the first processor in the node starts to run. Do not assume that the node that a device is connected to contains active processors.

If a system does not have a NUMA architecture, the routine writes zero to the location that the <i>NodeNumber</i> parameter points to. An example of non-NUMA architecture is a symmetric multiprocessor system (SMP).
