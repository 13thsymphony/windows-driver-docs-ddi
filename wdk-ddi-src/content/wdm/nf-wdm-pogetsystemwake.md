# PoGetSystemWake function
The <b>PoGetSystemWake</b> routine determines whether a specified IRP has been marked as waking the system from a sleeping state.

## Syntax

````
BOOLEAN PoGetSystemWake(
  _In_ PIRP Irp
);
````

## Parameters

`Irp`

A pointer to an IRP.


## Return Value

<b>PoGetSystemWake</b> returns one of the following:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b><b>TRUE</b></b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The specified IRP did cause the system to wake.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b><b>FALSE</b></b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The specified IRP did not cause the system to wake.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

A driver calls <b>PoGetSystemWake</b> to determine if a specified IRP contributed to waking the system from a sleep state.

A driver in a wait/wake chain should call <b>PoGetSystemWake</b> on its own wait/wake IRP at completion to determine if the driver should also call <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-posetsystemwake.md">PoSetSystemWake</a> for child wait/wake IRPs that the driver is about to complete. This ensures that system wake information properly propagates throughout the entire wait/wake chain.

It is possible that several IRPs are causing the system to wake. In this case, <b>PoGetSystemWake </b>would return <b>TRUE</b> for all of the IRPs contributing to the wake event.
