# ClfsAlignReservedLog function
The <b>ClfsAlignReservedLog</b> routine calculates the size of the space that must be reserved for a specified set of records. The size calculation includes the space required for headers and the space required for sector alignment.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS  ClfsAlignReservedLog(
  _In_  PVOID     pvMarshalContext,
  _In_  ULONG     cRecords,
  _In_  LONGLONG  rgcbReservation[],
  _Out_ PLONGLONG pcbAlignReservation
);
````

## Parameters

`pvMarshalContext`

A pointer to an opaque context that represents a marshalling area associated with a CLFS stream. The caller previously obtained this pointer by calling <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-clfscreatemarshallingarea.md">ClfsCreateMarshallingArea</a>.

`cRecords`

The number of elements in the array pointed to by <i>rgcbReservation</i>.

`rgcbReservation`

A pointer to an array of LONGLONG-typed variables that supplies a list of record sizes (in bytes).

`pcbAlignReservation`

A pointer to a LONGLONG-typed variable that receives the size, in bytes, of the required reservation.


## Return Value

<b>ClfsAlignReservedLog</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if it succeeds; otherwise, it returns one of the error codes defined in Ntstatus.h.

## Remarks
