# ClfsFlushToLsn function
The <b>ClfsFlushToLsn</b> routine forces, to stable storage, all records that have an LSN less than or equal to a specified LSN.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS ClfsFlushToLsn(
  _In_      PVOID     pvMarshalContext,
  _In_      PCLFS_LSN plsnFlush,
  _Out_opt_ PCLFS_LSN plsnLastFlushed
);
````

## Parameters

`pvMarshalContext`

A pointer to an opaque context associated with a marshalling area. The caller previously obtained this pointer by calling <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-clfscreatemarshallingarea.md">ClfsCreateMarshallingArea</a>.

`plsnFlush`

A pointer to a <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_cls_lsn.md">CLFS_LSN</a> structure. All records that have an LSN less than or equal to <i>plsnFlush</i> are guaranteed to be forced to stable storage. If <i>plsnFlush</i> is equal to CLFS_LSN_NULL, then all records in the marshalling area are forced to stable storage.

`plsnLastFlushed`

A pointer to a <b>CLFS_LSN</b> structure that receives the LSN of the oldest record that was not flushed. This is the LSN of the record immediately following the last record flushed. 

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    On successful return, <i>plsnLastFlushed</i> is greater than the value supplied in <i>plsnFlush</i>. However, <i>plsnLastFlushed</i> does not necessarily point to a record in the stream. For example, if all records in the stream were flushed, <i>plsnLastFlushed</i> is the LSN that will be assigned to the next record written to the stream.</div>
<div> </div>


## Return Value

<b>ClfsFlushToLsn</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if it succeeds; otherwise, it returns one of the error codes defined in Ntstatus.h.
