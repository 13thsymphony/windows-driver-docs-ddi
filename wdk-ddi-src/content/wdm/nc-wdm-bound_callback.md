# BOUND_CALLBACK callback



## -description
The <i>BoundCallback</i> routine is executed whenever the system issues a bounds exception for a user-mode thread.



## -prototype

````
BOUND_CALLBACK BoundCallback;

BOUND_CALLBACK_STATUS BoundCallback(void)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters


## -returns
A <a href="..\wdm\ne-wdm-_bound_callback_status.md">BOUND_CALLBACK_STATUS</a> value that indicates how the bounds exception was processed by the callback function. 

A <a href="..\wdm\ne-wdm-_bound_callback_status.md">BOUND_CALLBACK_STATUS</a> value that indicates how the bounds exception was processed by the callback function. 

A <a href="..\wdm\ne-wdm-_bound_callback_status.md">BOUND_CALLBACK_STATUS</a> value that indicates how the bounds exception was processed by the callback function. 


## -remarks
Drivers can supply a <i>BoundCallback</i> that is called when the system issues a bounds exception.

Use <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-keregisterboundcallback.md">KeRegisterBoundCallback</a> to register a <i>BoundCallback</i> routine. A driver can subsequently remove the callback by using the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-kederegisterboundcallback.md">KeDeregisterBoundCallback</a> routine. If the driver can be unloaded, it must remove any registered callbacks in its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564886">Unload</a> routine.
