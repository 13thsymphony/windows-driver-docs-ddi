# _IO_STATUS_BLOCK structure



## -description
A driver sets an IRP's I/O status block to indicate the final status of an I/O request, before calling <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iocompleterequest.md">IoCompleteRequest</a> for the IRP.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _IO_STATUS_BLOCK {
  union {
    NTSTATUS Status;
    PVOID    Pointer;
  };
  ULONG_PTR Information;
} IO_STATUS_BLOCK, *PIO_STATUS_BLOCK;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Status

This is the completion status, either STATUS_SUCCESS if the requested operation was completed successfully or an informational, warning, or error STATUS_<i>XXX</i> value. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565436">Using NTSTATUS values</a>.


### -field Pointer

Reserved. For internal use only.


### -field Information

This is set to a request-dependent value. For example, on successful completion of a transfer request, this is set to the number of bytes transferred. If a transfer request is completed with another STATUS_<i>XXX</i>, this member is set to zero. 


## -remarks
Unless a driver's dispatch routine completes an IRP with an error status value, the lowest-level driver in the chain frequently sets the IRP's I/O status block to the values that will be returned to the original requester of the I/O operation.

The <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-io_completion_routine.md">IoCompletion</a> routines of higher-level drivers usually check the I/O status block in IRPs completed by lower drivers. By design, the I/O status block in an IRP is the only information passed back from the underlying device driver to all higher-level drivers' <i>IoCompletion</i> routines.

The operating system implements <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/c0b21ead-875f-4b7a-a760-ec5b9ead184a">support routines</a> that write <b>IO_STATUS_BLOCK</b> values to caller-supplied output buffers. For example, see <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-zwopenfile.md">ZwOpenFile</a> or <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=155044">NtOpenFile</a>. These routines return status codes that might not match the status codes in the <b>IO_STATUS_BLOCK</b> structures. If one of these routines returns STATUS_PENDING, the caller should wait for the I/O operation to complete, and then check the status code in the <b>IO_STATUS_BLOCK</b> structure to determine the final status of the operation. If the routine returns a status code other than STATUS_PENDING, the caller should rely on this status code instead of the status code in the <b>IO_STATUS_BLOCK</b> structure.
