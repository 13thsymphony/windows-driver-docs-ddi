# ExReInitializeRundownProtection function
The <b>ExReInitializeRundownProtection</b> routine reinitializes an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj569379">EX_RUNDOWN_REF</a> structure after the associated object is run down.

## Syntax

````
VOID ExReInitializeRundownProtection(
  _Inout_ PEX_RUNDOWN_REF RunRef
);
````

## Parameters

`RunRef`

A pointer to an <b>EX_RUNDOWN_REF</b> structure that was initialized by a previous call to the  <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exinitializerundownprotection.md">ExInitializeRundownProtection</a> routine. The run-down protection routines use this structure to track the run-down status of the associated shared object. This structure is opaque to drivers.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

This routine is called by the driver that owns an object that resides in shared memory and that is accessed by other drivers.

<b>ExReInitializeRundownProtection</b> enables a previously used <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj569379">EX_RUNDOWN_REF</a> structure to be associated with a new object, and initializes run-down protection on this object. After the <b>ExReInitializeRundownProtection</b> call, drivers can call <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exacquirerundownprotection.md">ExAcquireRundownProtection</a> to acquire run-down protection on the new object.

An <b>ExReInitializeRundownProtection</b> call must be preceded by a call to the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exwaitforrundownprotectionrelease.md">ExWaitForRundownProtectionRelease</a> routine that runs down the old object. Between the <b>ExWaitForRundownProtectionRelease</b> and <b>ExReInitializeRundownProtection</b> calls, the driver might call the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exrundowncompleted.md">ExRundownCompleted</a> routine to indicate that the run down of the old object has completed.

On entry, the status information in the <b>EX_RUNDOWN_REF</b> structure must indicate that the old object was run down. Otherwise, <b>ExReInitializeRundownProtection</b> bug checks in checked builds.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj569382">Run-Down Protection</a>.
