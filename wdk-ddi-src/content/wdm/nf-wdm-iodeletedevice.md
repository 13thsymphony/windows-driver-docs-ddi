# IoDeleteDevice function
The <b>IoDeleteDevice</b> routine removes a device object from the system, for example, when the underlying device is removed from the system.

## Syntax

```
NTKERNELAPI VOID IoDeleteDevice(
  __drv_freesMem(Mem)PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject
);
```

## Parameters

`DeviceObject`

Pointer to the device object to be deleted.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

When handling a PnP <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551738">IRP_MN_REMOVE_DEVICE</a> request, a PnP driver calls <b>IoDeleteDevice</b> to delete any associated device objects. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546687">Handling an IRP_MN_REMOVE_DEVICE Request</a> for details.

A legacy driver should call this routine when it is being unloaded or when its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552644">DriverEntry</a> routine encounters a fatal initialization error, such as being unable to properly initialize a physical device. This routine also is called when a driver reconfigures its devices dynamically. For example, a disk driver called to repartition a disk would call <b>IoDeleteDevice</b> to tear down the device objects representing partitions to be replaced.

A driver must release certain resources for which the driver supplied storage in its device extension before it calls <b>IoDeleteDevice</b>. For example, if the driver stores the pointer to its interrupt object(s) in the device extension, it must call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549089">IoDisconnectInterrupt</a> before calling <b>IoDeleteDevice</b>.

A driver can call <b>IoDeleteDevice</b> only once for a given device object.

When a driver calls <b>IoDeleteDevice</b>, the I/O manager deletes the target device object if there are no outstanding references to it. However, if any outstanding references remain, the I/O manager marks the device object as "delete pending" and deletes the device object when the references are released.
