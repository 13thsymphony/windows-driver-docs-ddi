# _POWER_STATE structure
The <b>POWER_STATE</b> union specifies a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/bb30bc89-d1f2-4cb3-bcfb-fb76c69dba27">system power state</a> value or a device power state value.

## Syntax
````
typedef union _POWER_STATE {
  SYSTEM_POWER_STATE SystemState;
  DEVICE_POWER_STATE DeviceState;
} POWER_STATE, *PPOWER_STATE;
````

## Members


`DeviceState`

A device power state value of type <a href="..\wudfddi\ne-wudfddi-_device_power_state.md">DEVICE_POWER_STATE</a>.

`SystemState`

A system power state value of type <a href="..\wdm\ne-wdm-_system_power_state.md">SYSTEM_POWER_STATE</a>.

## Remarks
The <b>POWER_STATE</b> union is used in conjunction with the <a href="..\wdm\ne-wdm-_power_state_type.md">POWER_STATE_TYPE</a> enumeration type to specify a system power state value or a device power state value. This union is also used in cases where the power state type is implicitly determined by the context in which it is used. For example, see <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-porequestpowerirp.md">PoRequestPowerIrp</a> and <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-posetpowerstate.md">PoSetPowerState</a>.

For more information about power management, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548108">Introduction to Power Management</a>.
