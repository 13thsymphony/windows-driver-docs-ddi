# IoStartNextPacketByKey function



## -description
The <b>IoStartNextPacketByKey</b> routine dequeues the next I/O request packet from the specified device object's associated device queue according to a specified sort-key value and calls the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563858">StartIo</a> routine with that IRP.



## -syntax

````
VOID IoStartNextPacketByKey(
  _In_ PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject,
  _In_ BOOLEAN        Cancelable,
  _In_ ULONG          Key
);
````


## -parameters

### -param DeviceObject [in]

Pointer to the device object for which the IRP is to be dequeued.


### -param Cancelable [in]

Specifies whether IRPs in the device queue can be canceled.


### -param Key [in]

Specifies the sort key that determines which entry to remove from the queue.


## -returns
None


## -remarks
If there are no IRPs currently in the device queue for the target device object, this routine simply returns control to the caller.

If the driver passed a pointer to a cancel routine when it called <b>IoStartPacket</b>, it should pass <b>TRUE</b> in the <i>Cancelable</i> parameter. If <i>Cancelable</i>  is <b>TRUE</b>, the I/O manager will use the cancel spin lock to protect the device queue and the current IRP. 

Drivers that do not have a <i>StartIo</i> routine cannot call <b>IoStartNextPacketByKey</b>.

Callers of <b>IoStartNextPacketByKey</b> must be running at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL. Usually, this routine is called from a device driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544079">DpcForIsr</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff542972">CustomDpc</a> routine, both of which are run at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL.
