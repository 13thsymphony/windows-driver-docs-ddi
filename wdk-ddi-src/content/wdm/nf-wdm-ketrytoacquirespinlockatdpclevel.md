# KeTryToAcquireSpinLockAtDpcLevel function
The <b>KeTryToAcquireSpinLockAtDpcLevel</b> routine attempts to acquire a spin lock at DISPATCH_LEVEL.

## Syntax

````
BOOLEAN KeTryToAcquireSpinLockAtDpcLevel(
  _Inout_ PKSPIN_LOCK SpinLock
);
````

## Parameters

`SpinLock`

Specifies the spin lock to acquire. The spin lock must have already been initialized by <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-keinitializespinlock.md">KeInitializeSpinLock</a>.


## Return Value

<b>KeTryToAcquireSpinLockAtDpcLevel</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the spin lock has been acquired, and <b>FALSE</b> if the spin lock is already being held and cannot be acquired.

## Remarks

If the specified spin lock is not busy, the <b>KeTryToAcquireSpinLockAtDpcLevel</b> routine acquires the spin lock (see <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-keacquirespinlock.md">KeAcquireSpinLock</a> for details) and returns <b>TRUE</b>. If the spin lock has already been acquired, the routine immediately returns <b>FALSE</b>.

If the spin lock is acquired, the caller can release it by using the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-kereleasespinlock.md">KeReleaseSpinLock</a> routine.

If you want the driver to block when it is unable to acquire the spin lock, use <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-keacquirespinlockatdpclevel.md">KeAcquireSpinLockAtDpcLevel</a> instead.

For more information about spin locks, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563830">Spin Locks</a>.
