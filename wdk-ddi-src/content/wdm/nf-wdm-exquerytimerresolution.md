# ExQueryTimerResolution function
The <b>ExQueryTimerResolution</b> routine reports the range of timer resolutions that are supported by the system clock.

## Syntax

````
VOID ExQueryTimerResolution(
  _Out_ PULONG MaximumTime,
  _Out_ PULONG MinimumTime,
  _Out_ PULONG CurrentTime
);
````

## Parameters

`MaximumTime`

A pointer to a location to which the routine writes the maximum time interval, in 100-nanosecond units, between successive ticks of the system clock. A <i>tick</i> is an interrupt caused by the system clock timer.

`MinimumTime`

A pointer to a location to which the routine writes the minimum time interval, in 100-nanosecond units, between successive ticks of the system clock.

`CurrentTime`

A pointer to a location to which the routine writes the current time interval, in 100-nanosecond units, between successive ticks of the system clock.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

If your driver calls the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exsettimerresolution.md">ExSetTimerResolution</a> routine to change the time interval between successive system clock interrupts, the driver can first call <b>ExQueryTimerResolution</b> to determine the range of intervals supported by the system clock.

When your driver calls a routine such as <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-kesettimerex.md">KeSetTimerEx</a> to set a timer, the accuracy of the timer depends on the resolution of the system clock. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj602805">Timer Accuracy</a>.
