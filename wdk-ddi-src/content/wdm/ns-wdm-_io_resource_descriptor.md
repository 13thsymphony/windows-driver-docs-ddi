## -struct-fields

### -field Option

Specifies whether this resource description is required, preferred, or alternative. One of the following values must be used:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>

### -field 0

</td>
<td width="60%">
The specified resource range is required, unless alternative ranges are also specified.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>

### -field IO_RESOURCE_PREFERRED

</td>
<td width="60%">
The specified resource range is preferred to any alternative ranges.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>

### -field IO_RESOURCE_ALTERNATIVE

</td>
<td width="60%">
The specified resource range is an alternative to the range preceding it. For example, if one <b>IO_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure specifies IRQ 5, with IO_RESOURCE_PREFERRED set, and the next structure specifies IRQ 3, with IO_RESOURCE_ALTERNATIVE set, the PnP manager assigns IRQ 3 to the device only if IRQ 5 is unavailable. (Multiple alternatives can be specified for each resource. Both IO_RESOURCE_ALTERNATIVE and IO_RESOURCE_PREFERRED can be set, indicating a preferred alternative.)

</td>
</tr>
<tr>

### -field IO_RESOURCE_DEFAULT

### -field Spare2


### -field u


### -field port

Specifies a range of I/O port addresses, using the following members.

Drivers for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system must use <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-rtliodecodememioresource.md">RtlIoDecodeMemIoResource</a> and <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-rtlioencodememioresource.md">RtlIoEncodeMemIoResource</a> to read and update this member, rather than updating it directly.


### -field Length

The length, in bytes, of the range of assignable I/O port addresses.


### -field Alignment

The alignment, in bytes, that the assigned starting address must adhere to. The assigned starting address must be an integer multiple of <i>Alignment</i>. 


### -field MinimumAddress

The minimum bus-relative I/O port address that can be assigned to the device.


### -field MaximumAddress

### -field Length

The length, in bytes, of the range of assignable memory addresses.


### -field Alignment

The alignment, in bytes, that the assigned starting address must adhere to. The assigned starting address must be an integer multiple of <i>Alignment</i>.

### -field MaximumAddress

The maximum bus-relative memory address that can be assigned to the device.

</dd>

### -field MinimumVector

The minimum bus-relative vector that can be assigned to the device.


### -field MaximumVector

The maximum bus-relative vector that can be assigned to the device.

If the <b>CM_RESOURCE_INTERRUPT_MESSAGE</b> flag bit is set, the values of the <b>MinimumVector</b> and <b>MaximumVector</b> members have special meanings. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565394">Using Interrupt Resource Descriptors</a>.


The system supplies the following additional members on Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system:


### -field AffinityPolicy

Specifies an <a href="..\wdm\ne-wdm-_irq_device_policy.md">IRQ_DEVICE_POLICY</a> value that indicates how the system should distribute a device's interrupts between processors.


### -field Group

Specifies a processor group number. <b>Group</b> is a valid (but optional) member of <b>u.Interrupt</b> only in Windows 7 and later versions of Windows. This member exists only if NT_PROCESSOR_GROUPS is defined at compile time. If the <b>Group</b> member exists, the <b>Group</b> and <b>TargetedProcessors</b> members together specify a group affinity that identifies the set of processors that should handle the device's interrupts. To specify an affinity for a particular group, set <b>AffinityPolicy</b> to <b>IrqPolicySpecifiedProcessors</b> and set <b>Group</b> to the appropriate group number. In addition, <b>TargetedProcessors</b> must specify the target processors in the group. If you set <b>AffinityPolicy</b> to a value other than <b>IrqPolicySpecifiedProcessors</b>, set <b>Group</b> to ALL_PROCESSOR_GROUPS to indicate that the driver is group-aware (that is, designed to handle information about processor groups). A driver cannot specify target processors if <b>Group</b> equals ALL_PROCESSOR_GROUPS; such target specifications are ignored.


### -field AffinityPolicy

Specifies an <a href="..\wdm\ne-wdm-_irq_device_policy.md">IRQ_DEVICE_POLICY</a> value that indicates how the system should distribute a device's interrupts between processors.


### -field PriorityPolicy

### -field TargetedProcessors

Specifies a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551830">KAFFINITY</a> value that indicates which processors should handle the device's interrupts. This value is used only if <b>AffinityPolicy</b> is <b>IrqPolicySpecifiedProcessors.</b>
