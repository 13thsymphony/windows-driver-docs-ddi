# _DMA_TRANSFER_INFO_V1 structure
The  <b>DMA_TRANSFER_INFO_V1</b> structure contains the allocation requirements for a scatter/gather list that describes the I/O data buffer for a DMA transfer.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DMA_TRANSFER_INFO_V1 {
  ULONG  MapRegisterCount;
  ULONG  ScatterGatherElementCount;
  ULONG  ScatterGatherListSize;
} DMA_ TRANSFER _INFO_V1, *PDMA_ TRANSFER _INFO_V1;
````

## Members


`MapRegisterCount`

The number of map registers required to translate all the physical addresses in the scatter/gather list to logical addresses.

`ScatterGatherElementCount`

The number of scatter/gather elements in the scatter/gather list. Each element is a structure of type <b>SCATTER_GATHER_ELEMENT</b>.

`ScatterGatherListSize`

The required size, in bytes, of the scatter/gather buffer. This buffer contains the scatter/gather list that describes the memory that is used to buffer I/O data during the DMA transfer. The scatter/gather buffer must be large enough to contain a <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_scatter_gather_list.md">SCATTER_GATHER_LIST</a> structure and an array of <b>SCATTER_GATHER_ELEMENT</b> structures, plus additional data that is used internally by the operating system.

## Remarks
The <b>V1</b> member of the <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_dma_transfer_info.md">DMA_TRANSFER_INFO</a> structure is a structure of type <b>DMA_TRANSFER_INFO_V1</b>.

The <i>Mdl</i>, <i>Offset</i>, and <i>Length</i> parameters to the <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pget_dma_transfer_info.md">GetDmaTransferInfo</a> routine together describe the I/O data buffer for a DMA transfer. For the purpose of programming a DMA controller, this buffer can more conveniently be described by a scatter/gather list. (A scatter/gather list describes the memory in an I/O data buffer but does not contain this memory.) A driver calls <b>GetDmaTransferInfo</b> to obtain the allocation requirements for this scatter/gather list. <b>GetDmaTransferInfo</b> writes the allocation requirements into the <b>V1</b> member of a caller-supplied <b>DMA_TRANSFER_INFO</b> structure.
