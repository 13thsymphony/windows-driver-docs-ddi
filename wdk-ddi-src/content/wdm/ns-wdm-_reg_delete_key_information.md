# _REG_DELETE_KEY_INFORMATION structure
The <b>REG_DELETE_KEY_INFORMATION</b> structure contains information that a driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560903">RegistryCallback</a> routine can use when a registry key is being deleted.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct _REG_DELETE_KEY_INFORMATION {
  PVOID Object;
  PVOID CallContext;
  PVOID ObjectContext;
  PVOID Reserved;
} *PREG_FLUSH_KEY_INFORMATION, REG_FLUSH_KEY_INFORMATION, *PREG_DELETE_KEY_INFORMATION, REG_DELETE_KEY_INFORMATION;
```

## Members


`Object`

A pointer to the registry key object for the key to be deleted.

`CallContext`

Optional driver-defined context information that the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560903">RegistryCallback</a> routine can supply. This member is defined for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system.

`ObjectContext`

A pointer to driver-defined context information that the driver has associated with a registry object by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541924">CmSetCallbackObjectContext</a>. This member is defined for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system.

`Reserved`

This member is reserved for future use. This member is defined for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system.

## Remarks
The system passes this structure to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560903">RegistryCallback</a> routine every time a thread attempts to delete a key—for example, when a user-mode thread calls <b>RegDeleteKey</b> or <b>RegDeleteKeyEx</b> or when a driver calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566437">ZwDeleteKey</a>.

For more information about registry filtering operations, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545879">Filtering Registry Calls</a>.
