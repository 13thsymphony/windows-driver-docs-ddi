# _REG_DELETE_KEY_INFORMATION structure



## -description
The <b>REG_DELETE_KEY_INFORMATION</b> structure contains information that a driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560903">RegistryCallback</a> routine can use when a registry key is being deleted.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _REG_DELETE_KEY_INFORMATION {
  PVOID Object;
  PVOID CallContext;
  PVOID ObjectContext;
  PVOID Reserved;
} REG_DELETE_KEY_INFORMATION, *PREG_DELETE_KEY_INFORMATION;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Object

A pointer to the registry key object for the key to be deleted.


### -field CallContext

Optional driver-defined context information that the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560903">RegistryCallback</a> routine can supply. This member is defined for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system. 


### -field ObjectContext

A pointer to driver-defined context information that the driver has associated with a registry object by calling <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-cmsetcallbackobjectcontext.md">CmSetCallbackObjectContext</a>. This member is defined for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system.


### -field Reserved

This member is reserved for future use. This member is defined for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system.


## -remarks
The system passes this structure to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560903">RegistryCallback</a> routine every time a thread attempts to delete a key—for example, when a user-mode thread calls <b>RegDeleteKey</b> or <b>RegDeleteKeyEx</b> or when a driver calls <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-zwdeletekey.md">ZwDeleteKey</a>.
