# _OSVERSIONINFOEXW structure
The <b>RTL_OSVERSIONINFOEXW</b> structure contains operating system version information.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _OSVERSIONINFOEXW {
  ULONG  dwOSVersionInfoSize;
  ULONG  dwMajorVersion;
  ULONG  dwMinorVersion;
  ULONG  dwBuildNumber;
  ULONG  dwPlatformId;
  WCHAR  szCSDVersion[128];

  UCHAR  wProductType;
  UCHAR  wReserved;
} RTL_OSVERSIONINFOEXW, *PRTL_OSVERSIONINFOEXW;
````

## Members


`dwBuildNumber`

The build number of the operating system.

`dwMajorVersion`

The major version number of the operating system. For example, for Windows 2000, the major version number is five. For more information, see the table in Remarks.

`dwMinorVersion`

The minor version number of the operating system. For example, for Windows 2000, the minor version number is zero. For more information, see the table in Remarks.

`dwOSVersionInfoSize`

The size, in bytes, of an <b>RTL_OSVERSIONINFOEXW</b> structure. This member must be set before the structure is used with <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-rtlgetversion.md">RtlGetVersion</a>.

`dwPlatformId`

The operating system platform. For Win32 on NT-based operating systems, <b>RtlGetVersion</b> returns the value VER_PLATFORM_WIN32_NT.

`szCSDVersion`

The service-pack version string. This member contains a null-terminated string, such as "Service Pack 3", which indicates the latest service pack installed on the system. If no service pack is installed, <b>RtlGetVersion</b> might not initialize this string. Initialize <i>szCSDVersion</i> to zero (empty string) before the call to <b>RtlGetVersion</b>.

`wProductType`

The product type. This member contains additional information about the system. This member can be one of the following values: 
<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
VER_NT_WORKSTATION

</td>
<td>
Windows 2000 or later professional version

</td>
<td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>
VER_NT_SERVER

</td>
<td>

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`wReserved`

Reserved for future use.

`wServicePackMajor`

The major version number of the latest service pack installed on the system. For example, for Service Pack 3, the major version number is three. If no service pack has been installed, the value is zero.

`wServicePackMinor`

The minor version number of the latest service pack installed on the system. For example, for Service Pack 3, the minor version number is zero.

`wSuiteMask`

The product suites available on the system. This member is set to zero or to the bitwise OR of one or more of the following values.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    You should not rely solely on the VER_SUITE_SMALLBUSINESS flag to determine whether Small Business Server is currently installed. Both this flag and the VER_SUITE_SMALLBUSINESS_RESTRICTED flag are set when this product suite is installed. If you upgrade this installation to Windows Server, Standard Edition, the VER_SUITE_SMALLBUSINESS_RESTRICTED flag is cleared, but the VER_SUITE_SMALLBUSINESS flag remains set, which, in this case, indicates that Small Business Server was previously installed on this system. If this installation is further upgraded to Windows Server, Enterprise Edition, the VER_SUITE_SMALLBUSINESS flag remains set.</div><div> </div>

## Remarks
The information in this structure includes the major and minor version numbers, the build number, the platform identifier, the installed product suites, and the latest service pack that is installed on the system. This structure is used with the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-rtlgetversion.md">RtlGetVersion</a> and <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-rtlverifyversioninfo.md">RtlVerifyVersionInfo</a> routines.

Relying on version information is not always the best way to test whether a feature is available. For guidance, refer to the documentation for the feature you are interested in.

If possible, design the version detection code in your driver to enable the driver to run on future versions of Windows. If your driver requires a particular operating system version, be sure to treat this version as the minimum supported version, and not as the only version on which the driver can run.

The following table summarizes the version information that is returned by supported versions of Windows. Use the information in the "Other" column to distinguish between operating systems with identical version numbers.
