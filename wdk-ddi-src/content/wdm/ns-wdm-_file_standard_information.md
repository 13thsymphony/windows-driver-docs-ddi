# _FILE_STANDARD_INFORMATION structure
The <b>FILE_STANDARD_INFORMATION</b> structure is used as an argument to routines that query or set file information.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct _FILE_STANDARD_INFORMATION {
  LARGE_INTEGER AllocationSize;
  LARGE_INTEGER EndOfFile;
  ULONG         NumberOfLinks;
  BOOLEAN       DeletePending;
  BOOLEAN       Directory;
} FILE_STANDARD_INFORMATION, *PFILE_STANDARD_INFORMATION;
```

## Members


`AllocationSize`

The file allocation size in bytes. Usually, this value is a multiple of the sector or cluster size of the underlying physical device.

`EndOfFile`

The end of file location as a byte offset.

`NumberOfLinks`

The number of hard links to the file.

`DeletePending`

The delete pending status. <b>TRUE</b> indicates that a file deletion has been requested.

`Directory`

The file directory status. <b>TRUE</b> indicates the file object represents a directory.

## Remarks
<b>EndOfFile</b> specifies the byte offset to the end of the file. Because this value is zero-based, it actually refers to the first free byte in the file; that is, it is the offset to the byte immediately following the last valid byte in the file.
