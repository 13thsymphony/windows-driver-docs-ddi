# _REG_RESTORE_KEY_INFORMATION structure
The <b>REG_RESTORE_KEY_INFORMATION</b> structure contains the information for a registry key that is about to be restored.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _REG_RESTORE_KEY_INFORMATION {
  PVOID  Object;
  HANDLE FileHandle;
  ULONG  Flags;
  PVOID  CallContext;
  PVOID  ObjectContext;
  PVOID  Reserved;
} REG_RESTORE_KEY_INFORMATION, *PREG_RESTORE_KEY_INFORMATION;
````

## Members


`CallContext`

Optional driver-defined context information that the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560903">RegistryCallback</a> routine can supply. This member is defined for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system.

`FileHandle`

A handle to the file from which the hive will be restored.

`Flags`

<b>REG_FORCE_RESTORE</b>

0x00000008L

If specified, the restore operation is executed even if open handles exist at or beneath the location in the registry hierarchy to which the <i>hKey</i> parameter points.

<b>REG_WHOLE_HIVE_VOLATILE</b>

0x00000001L

If specified, a new, volatile (memory-only) set of registry information, or <i>hive</i>, is created. If REG_WHOLE_HIVE_VOLATILE is specified, the key identified by the <i>hKey</i> parameter must be either the HKEY_USERS or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE value.

<b>REG_REFRESH_HIVE</b>

0x00000002

If set, the location of the subtree that the <i>hKey</i> parameter points to is restored to its state immediately following the last flush. The subtree must not be lazy flushed (by calling <b>RegRestoreKey</b> with REG_NO_LAZY_FLUSH specified as the value of this parameter); the caller must have the trusted computing base (TCB) privilege; and the handle to which the <i>hKey</i> parameter refers must point to the root of the subtree.

`Object`

A pointer to a registry key object for the key whose name is about to be changed.

`ObjectContext`

A pointer to driver-defined context information, which the driver has associated with a registry object by calling <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-cmsetcallbackobjectcontext.md">CmSetCallbackObjectContext</a>. This member is defined for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system.

`Reserved`

This member is reserved for future use. This member is defined for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system.

## Remarks
Note that when a key is restored, only the last component of the path can be changed.

The REG_REFRESH_HIVE flag is opaque and a filter should not attempt to change it.

For more information about registry filtering operations, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545879">Filtering Registry Calls</a>.
