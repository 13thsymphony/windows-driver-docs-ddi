# PO_FX_DEVICE_POWER_NOT_REQUIRED_CALLBACK function



## -description
The <i>DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback</i> callback routine notifies the device driver that the device is not required to stay in the D0 power state.



## -syntax

````
PO_FX_DEVICE_POWER_NOT_REQUIRED_CALLBACK DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback;

VOID DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback(
  _In_ PVOID Context
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param Context [in]

A pointer to the device context. The device driver uses this context to store information about the current power state of the device. The device driver specified this pointer in the <b>DeviceContext</b> member of the <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_po_fx_device_v1.md">PO_FX_DEVICE</a> structure that the driver used to register the device with the power management framework (PoFx). This context is opaque to PoFx.


## -returns
None.


## -remarks
When PoFx calls the driver's <i>DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback</i> routine, the driver must first decide whether to initiate a transition to a low-power Dx state (by sending an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551744">IRP_MN_SET_POWER</a> request down the device stack) or to remain in the D0 state. Next, without waiting for any Dx transition to complete, the driver must call the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-pofxcompletedevicepowernotrequired.md">PoFxCompleteDevicePowerNotRequired</a> routine to notify PoFx that the driver completed its response to the <i>DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback</i> callback. The driver can call <b>PoFxCompleteDevicePowerNotRequired</b> before or after the <i>DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback</i> routine returns.

When a device is in the D0 state, and the Fx state or active/idle condition of a component in the device changes, PoFx evaluates whether the device can enter a low-power Dx state or must remain in the D0 state. If the device can enter a low-power Dx state, PoFx calls the driver's <i>DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback</i> routine.

If the device enters a low-power Dx state in response to a <i>DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback</i> callback, but PoFx later determines that the device must enter the D0 state, PoFx calls the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh450949">DevicePowerRequiredCallback</a> routine. In response to this call, the device must enter the D0 state.

To define a <i>DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback</i> callback routine, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of callback routine you're defining. Windows provides a set of callback function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the callback function types helps <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2F3549EF-B50F-455A-BDC7-1F67782B8DCA">Code Analysis for Drivers</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/74feeb16-387c-4796-987a-aff3fb79b556">Static Driver Verifier</a> (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it's a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

For example, to define a <i>DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback</i> callback routine that is named <code>MyDevicePowerNotRequiredCallback</code>, use the PO_FX_DEVICE_POWER_NOT_REQUIRED_CALLBACK type as shown in this code example:

Then, implement your callback routine as follows:

The PO_FX_DEVICE_POWER_NOT_REQUIRED_CALLBACK function type is defined in the Wdm.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation to your function definition. The _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the PO_FX_DEVICE_POWER_NOT_REQUIRED_CALLBACK function type in the header file are used. For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3260b53e-82be-4dbc-8ac5-d0e52de77f9d">Declaring Functions by Using Function Role Types for WDM Drivers</a>. For information about _Use_decl_annotations_, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=286697">Annotating Function Behavior</a>.
