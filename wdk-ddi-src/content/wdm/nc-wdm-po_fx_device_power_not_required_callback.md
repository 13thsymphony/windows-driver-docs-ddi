# PO_FX_DEVICE_POWER_NOT_REQUIRED_CALLBACK function
The <i>DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback</i> callback routine notifies the device driver that the device is not required to stay in the D0 power state.

## Syntax

```
PO_FX_DEVICE_POWER_NOT_REQUIRED_CALLBACK PoFxDevicePowerNotRequiredCallback;

void PoFxDevicePowerNotRequiredCallback(
  PVOID Context
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Context`

A pointer to the device context. The device driver uses this context to store information about the current power state of the device. The device driver specified this pointer in the <b>DeviceContext</b> member of the <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_po_fx_device_v1.md">PO_FX_DEVICE</a> structure that the driver used to register the device with the power management framework (PoFx). This context is opaque to PoFx.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

When PoFx calls the driver's <i>DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback</i> routine, the driver must first decide whether to initiate a transition to a low-power Dx state (by sending an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551744">IRP_MN_SET_POWER</a> request down the device stack) or to remain in the D0 state. Next, without waiting for any Dx transition to complete, the driver must call the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-pofxcompletedevicepowernotrequired.md">PoFxCompleteDevicePowerNotRequired</a> routine to notify PoFx that the driver completed its response to the <i>DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback</i> callback. The driver can call <b>PoFxCompleteDevicePowerNotRequired</b> before or after the <i>DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback</i> routine returns.

When a device is in the D0 state, and the Fx state or active/idle condition of a component in the device changes, PoFx evaluates whether the device can enter a low-power Dx state or must remain in the D0 state. If the device can enter a low-power Dx state, PoFx calls the driver's <i>DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback</i> routine.

If the device enters a low-power Dx state in response to a <i>DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback</i> callback, but PoFx later determines that the device must enter the D0 state, PoFx calls the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh450949">DevicePowerRequiredCallback</a> routine. In response to this call, the device must enter the D0 state.
