# InterlockedExchangePointer function



## -description
The <b>InterlockedExchangePointer</b> routine performs an atomic operation that sets a pointer to a new value.



## -syntax

````
PVOID InterlockedExchangePointer(
  _Inout_  PVOID volatile *Target,
  _In_opt_ PVOID          Value
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Target [in, out]

A pointer to a PVOID value. The routine sets (*<i>Target</i>) to <i>Value</i>.


### -param Value [in, optional]

Specifies the PVOID value to set (*<i>Target</i>) to.


## -returns
<b>InterlockedExchangePointer</b> returns the original value of the pointer at *<i>Target</i> (that is, the value of this pointer at entry to the routine).


## -remarks
<b>InterlockedExchangePointer</b> provides a fast, atomic way to synchronize updating a pointer variable that is shared by multiple threads.

<b>InterlockedExchangePointer</b> is designed for speed and, typically, is implemented inline by a compiler. <b>InterlockedExchangePointer</b> is atomic only with respect to other <b>Interlocked<i>Xxx</i></b> calls. It does not use a spin lock and can be safely used on pageable data. 

The <i>Target</i> parameter should be aligned on either a 32-bit or 64-bit boundary, depending on the system type, for better performance.

A call to <b>InterlockedExchangePointer</b> is atomic only with respect to other <b>Interlocked<i>Xxx</i></b> calls.

Interlocked operations cannot be used on non-cached memory.
