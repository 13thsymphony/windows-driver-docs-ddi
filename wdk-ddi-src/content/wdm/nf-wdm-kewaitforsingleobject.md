# KeWaitForSingleObject function
The <b>KeWaitForSingleObject</b> routine puts the current thread into a wait state until the given dispatcher object is set to a signaled state or (optionally) until the wait times out.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS KeWaitForSingleObject(
  _In_     PVOID           Object,
  _In_     KWAIT_REASON    WaitReason,
  _In_     KPROCESSOR_MODE WaitMode,
  _In_     BOOLEAN         Alertable,
  _In_opt_ PLARGE_INTEGER  Timeout
);
````

## Parameters

`Object`

Pointer to an initialized dispatcher object (event, mutex, semaphore, thread, or timer) for which the caller supplies the storage.

`WaitReason`

Specifies the reason for the wait. A driver should set this value to <b>Executive</b>, unless it is doing work on behalf of a user and is running in the context of a user thread, in which case it should set this value to <b>UserRequest</b>.

`WaitMode`

Specifies whether the caller waits in <b>KernelMode</b> or <b>UserMode</b>. Lowest-level and intermediate drivers should specify <b>KernelMode</b>. If the given <i>Object</i> is a mutex, the caller must specify <b>KernelMode</b>.

`Alertable`

Specifies a Boolean value that is <b>TRUE</b> if the wait is alertable and <b>FALSE</b> otherwise.

`Timeout`

Pointer to a time-out value that specifies the absolute or relative time, in 100-nanosecond units, at which the wait is to be completed.

A positive value specifies an absolute time, relative to January 1, 1601. A negative value specifies an interval relative to the current time. Absolute expiration times track any changes in the system time; relative expiration times are not affected by system time changes. 

If *<i>Timeout</i> = 0, the routine returns without waiting. If the caller supplies a <b>NULL</b> pointer, the routine waits indefinitely until the dispatcher object is set to the signaled state. For more information, see the following Remarks section.


## Return Value

<b>KeWaitForSingleObject</b> can return one of the following:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The dispatcher object specified by the <i>Object</i> parameter satisfied the wait.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_ALERTED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The wait was interrupted to deliver an alert to the calling thread.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_USER_APC</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The wait was interrupted to deliver a user asynchronous procedure call (APC) to the calling thread.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_TIMEOUT</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
A time-out occurred before the object was set to a signaled state. This value can be returned when the specified set of wait conditions cannot be immediately met and <i>Timeout</i> is set to zero.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

Note that the NT_SUCCESS macro recognizes all of these status values as "success" values.

## Remarks

The current state of the specified <i>Object</i> is examined to determine whether the wait can be satisfied immediately. If so, the necessary side effects are performed on the object. Otherwise, the current thread is put in a waiting state and a new thread is selected for execution on the current processor.

The <i>Alertable</i> parameter determines when the thread can be alerted and its wait state consequently aborted. For additional information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565592">Waits and APCs</a>.

A special consideration applies when the <i>Object</i> parameter passed to <b>KeWaitForSingleObject</b> is a mutex. If the dispatcher object waited on is a mutex, APC delivery is the same as for all other dispatcher objects <u>during the wait</u>. However, after <b>KeWaitForSingleObject</b> returns with STATUS_SUCCESS and the thread actually holds the mutex, only special kernel-mode APCs are delivered. Delivery of all other APCs, both kernel-mode and user-mode, is disabled. This restriction on the delivery of APCs persists until the mutex is released.

If the <i>WaitMode</i> parameter is <b>UserMode</b>, the kernel stack can be swapped out during the wait. Consequently, a caller must <u>never</u> attempt to pass parameters on the stack when calling <b>KeWaitForSingleObject</b> using the <b>UserMode</b> argument. If you allocate the event on the stack, you must set the <i>WaitMode</i> parameter to <b>KernelMode</b>.

It is especially important to check the return value of <b>KeWaitForSingleObject</b> when the <i>WaitMode</i> parameter is <b>UserMode</b> or <i>Alertable</i> is <b>TRUE</b>, because <b>KeWaitForSingleObject</b> might return early with a status of STATUS_USER_APC or STATUS_ALERTED.

All long-term waits that can be aborted by a user should be <b>UserMode</b> waits and <i>Alertable</i> should be set to <b>FALSE</b>.

Where possible, <i>Alertable</i> should be set to <b>FALSE</b> and <i>WaitMode</i> should be set to <b>KernelMode</b>, in order to reduce driver complexity. The principal exception to this is when the wait is a long-term wait.

If a <b>NULL</b> pointer is supplied for <i>Timeout</i>, the calling thread remains in a wait state until the <i>Object</i> is signaled.

A time-out value of zero allows the testing of a set of wait conditions and for the conditional performance of any side effects if the wait can be immediately satisfied, as in the acquisition of a mutex.

Time-out intervals are measured relative to the system clock, and the accuracy with which the operating system can detect the end of a time-out interval is limited by the granularity of the system clock. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj602805">Timer Accuracy</a>.

A mutex can be recursively acquired only MINLONG times. If this limit is exceeded, the routine raises a STATUS_MUTANT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED exception.

Callers of <b>KeWaitForSingleObject</b> must be running at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL. However, if <i>Timeout</i> = <b>NULL</b> or *<i>Timeout</i> != 0, the caller must be running at IRQL &lt;= APC_LEVEL and in a nonarbitrary thread context. (If <i>Timeout</i> != <b>NULL</b> and *<i>Timeout</i> = 0, the caller must be running at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL.)

<b>KeWaitForMutexObject</b> is a macro that converts to <b>KeWaitForSingleObject</b>, which can be used instead.

For better performance, use fast mutexes or guarded mutexes. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540595">Alternatives to Mutex Objects</a>.

For more information about how to use this routine, see <b>KeWaitForSingleObject</b>. 

For more information about mutex objects, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556417">Mutex Objects</a>.

A mutex can be recursively acquired only MINLONG times. If this limit is exceeded, the routine raises a STATUS_MUTANT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED exception.

Callers of <b>KeWaitForMutexObject</b> must be running at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL. However, if <i>Timeout</i> = <b>NULL</b> or *<i>Timeout</i> != 0, the caller must be running at IRQL &lt;= APC_LEVEL and in a nonarbitrary thread context. (If <i>Timeout</i> != <b>NULL</b> and *<i>Timeout</i> = 0, the caller must be running at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL.)
