# PPUT_SCATTER_GATHER_LIST callback



## -description
The <b>PutScatterGatherList</b> routine frees the previously allocated map registers and scatter/gather list used in scatter/gather DMA. 



## -prototype

````
PPUT_SCATTER_GATHER_LIST PutScatterGatherList;

VOID PutScatterGatherList(
  _In_ PDMA_ADAPTER         DmaAdapter,
  _In_ PSCATTER_GATHER_LIST ScatterGather,
  _In_ BOOLEAN              WriteToDevice
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param DmaAdapter [in]

Pointer to the <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_dma_adapter.md">DMA_ADAPTER</a> structure returned by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549220">IoGetDmaAdapter</a> that represents the bus-master adapter or DMA controller.


### -param ScatterGather [in]

Pointer to a <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_scatter_gather_list.md">SCATTER_GATHER_LIST</a> structure previously returned by <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pget_scatter_gather_list.md">GetScatterGatherList</a>. 


### -param WriteToDevice [in]

Indicates the direction of the DMA transfer: specify <b>TRUE</b> for a transfer from the buffer to the device, and <b>FALSE</b> otherwise. 


## -returns
None


## -remarks
<b>PutScatterGatherList</b>
           is not a system routine that can be called directly by name. This routine is callable only by pointer from the address returned in a 
          <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_dma_operations.md">DMA_OPERATIONS</a>
           structure. Drivers obtain the address of this routine by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549220">IoGetDmaAdapter</a>.

Drivers should call <b>PutScatterGatherList</b> after completing scatter/gather I/O. This routine flushes the adapter buffers, frees the map registers, and unmaps and frees the associated MDLs. Additionally, the routine frees the scatter/gather list if it was previously allocated by <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pget_scatter_gather_list.md">GetScatterGatherList</a>.
