# KeIpiGenericCall function
The <b>KeIpiGenericCall</b> routine causes the specified routine to run on all processors simultaneously.

## Syntax

````
ULONG_PTR KeIpiGenericCall(
  _In_ PKIPI_BROADCAST_WORKER BroadcastFunction,
  _In_ ULONG_PTR              Context
);
````

## Parameters

`BroadcastFunction`

Pointer to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550688">IpiGenericCall</a> routine. This routine is run on every processor simultaneously.

`Context`

Specifies the value to pass to <i>IpiGenericCall</i> when it is called.


## Return Value

<b>KeIpiGenericCall</b> returns the value that <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550688">IpiGenericCall</a> returns on the source processor (the processor that called <b>KeIpiGenericCall</b>).

## Remarks

When a driver calls <b>KeIpiGenericCall</b>, the system interrupts every processor and raises the IRQL to IPI_LEVEL (interprocessor interrupt level). Each processor spins on a barrier until all processors have reached the barrier; then, all processors begin calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550688">IpiGenericCall</a>. <b>KeIpiGenericCall</b> waits for all calls to <i>IpiGenericCall</i> to complete before returning.
