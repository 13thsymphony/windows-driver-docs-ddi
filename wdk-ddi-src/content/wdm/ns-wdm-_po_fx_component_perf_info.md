# _PO_FX_COMPONENT_PERF_INFO structure
The <b>PO_FX_COMPONENT_PERF_INFO</b> structure describes  all the sets of performance states for a  single component within a device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PO_FX_COMPONENT_PERF_INFO {
  ULONG                    PerfStateSetsCount;
  PO_FX_COMPONENT_PERF_SET PerfStateSets[ANYSIZE_ARRAY];
} PO_FX_COMPONENT_PERF_INFO, *PPO_FX_COMPONENT_PERF_INFO;
````

## Members


`PerfStateSets`

This member is the first element in an array of one or more <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_po_fx_component_perf_set.md">PO_FX_COMPONENT_PERF_SET</a> elements. Each  <b>PO_FX_COMPONENT_PERF_SET</b> represents one set of supported performance states for a component. If the array contains more than one element, the additional elements immediately follow the first element.

`PerfStateSetsCount`

The number of elements in the array <b>PerfStateSets</b> array.

## Remarks
When a device driver calls the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-pofxregistercomponentperfstates.md">PoFxRegisterComponentPerfStates</a> routine to register a component for performance state support with the power management framework (PoFx),  the driver can supply a <b>PO_FX_COMPONENT_PERF_INFO</b> structure that  describes the sets of the performance states supported by the component. The <b>PerfStateSets</b> member of the <b>PO_FX_COMPONENT_PERF_INFO</b> structure contains an array of <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_po_fx_component_perf_set.md">PO_FX_COMPONENT_PERF_SET</a> structures that represent the supported performance states.

Most drivers are expected to define a single set of performance states per component. For example, a driver might define one set of performance states to control the clock frequency for a component. However, some drivers may need to define more than one performance state set to control multiple dimensions of performance states for a component. For example, a driver might define two sets of performance states to control the clock frequency and bus bandwidth.
