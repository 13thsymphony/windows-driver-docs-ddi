# ExInterlockedCompareExchange64 function
The <b>ExInterlockedCompareExchange64</b> routine compares one integer variable to another and, if they are equal, sets the first variable to a caller-supplied value.

## Syntax

```
void ExInterlockedCompareExchange64(
   Destination,
   Exchange,
   Comperand,
   Lock
);
```

## Parameters

`Destination`

A pointer to an integer that will be compared and possibly replaced.

`Exchange`

A pointer to an integer that will replace the one at <i>Destination</i> if the comparison results in equality.

`Comperand`

TBD

`Lock`

A pointer to a caller-allocated spin-lock that is used if the host system does not support an 8-byte atomic compare-and-exchange operation.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

<b>ExInterlockedCompareExchange64</b> tests and, possibly, replaces the value of a given variable. For most underlying microprocessors, this routine is implemented inline by the compiler to execute as an atomic operation. If a spin lock is used, this routine can only be safely used on nonpaged parameters.

If the <i>Destination</i> and <i>Comparand</i> are unequal, <b>ExInterlockedCompareExchange64</b> simply returns the value of <i>Destination</i>.

<b>ExInterlockedCompareExchange64</b> is atomic only with respect to other <b>(Ex)Interlocked<i>Xxx</i></b> calls. 

Callers of <b>ExInterlockedCompareExchange64</b> can be running at any IRQL. The storage for the <i>Destination</i>, Comparand, and <i>Exchange</i> parameter and the list entries must be resident at all IRQLs.
