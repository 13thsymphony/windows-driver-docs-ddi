# PCANCEL_MAPPED_TRANSFER callback



## -description
The <b>CancelMappedTransfer</b> routine cancels a system DMA transfer that is currently mapped to an adapter.



## -prototype

````
PCANCEL_MAPPED_TRANSFER CancelMappedTransfer;

NTSTATUS CancelMappedTransfer(
  _In_ PDMA_ADAPTER DmaAdapter,
  _In_ PVOID        DmaTransferContext
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param DmaAdapter [in]

A pointer to a <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_dma_adapter.md">DMA_ADAPTER</a> structure. This structure is the adapter object that is waiting for the pending DMA transfer to complete. The caller obtained this pointer from a previous call to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549220">IoGetDmaAdapter</a> routine, and the caller passed this pointer to the <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pmap_transfer_ex.md">MapTransferEx</a> call that set up the map registers for the DMA transfer.


### -param DmaTransferContext [in]

A pointer to a DMA transfer context. This parameter value must be the same DMA transfer context that was passed to the <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pallocate_adapter_channel_ex.md">AllocateAdapterChannelEx</a> call that requested the adapter channel allocation.


## -returns
<b>CancelMappedTransfer</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call is successful. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate error code.


## -remarks
<b>CancelMappedTransfer</b><i> is not a system routine that can be called directly by name. This routine can be called only by pointer from the address returned in a </i><a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_dma_operations.md">DMA_OPERATIONS</a><i> structure. </i>Drivers obtain the address of this routine by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549220">IoGetDmaAdapter</a> with the <b>Version</b> member of the <i>DeviceDescription</i> parameter set to DEVICE_DESCRIPTION_VERSION3. If <b>IoGetDmaAdapter</b> returns <b>NULL</b>, the routine is not available on your platform.

This routine marks the associated transfer context as canceled, which prevents any further transfers under this context. After a transfer is canceled, its completion routine is called, but the status for the transfer might be set to <b>DmaCancelled</b>.

Regardless of whether a system DMA transfer is canceled or completed, the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545917">FlushAdapterBuffers</a> or <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pflush_adapter_buffers_ex.md">FlushAdapterBuffersEx</a> routine must always be called to flush any data that remains in the system DMA controller's internal cache at the end of a DMA transfer operation. After the transfer is canceled or completed, the <b>FlushAdapterBuffers<i>Xxx</i></b> call must occur before either the DMA channel is released or the <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pmap_transfer_ex.md">MapTransferEx</a> routine is called to set up the map registers for a new DMA transfer.
