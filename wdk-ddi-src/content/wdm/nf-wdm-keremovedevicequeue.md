# KeRemoveDeviceQueue function
The <b>KeRemoveDeviceQueue</b> routine removes an entry from the head of a specified device queue.

## Syntax

````
PKDEVICE_QUEUE_ENTRY KeRemoveDeviceQueue(
  _Inout_ PKDEVICE_QUEUE DeviceQueue
);
````

## Parameters

`DeviceQueue`

Pointer to an initialized device queue object for which the caller provides the storage.


## Return Value

If the device queue is empty but is set to a busy state, <b>KeRemoveDeviceQueue</b> returns <b>NULL</b>.

## Remarks

The specified device queue spin lock is acquired and the state of the device queue is checked. If the device queue is set to a busy state and an IRP is queued, this routine dequeues the entry and returns a pointer to the IRP. A call to <b>KeRemoveDeviceQueue</b> when the device queue object is set to a busy state but no IRPs are queued causes a state change to not-busy. The specified device queue's spin lock is released.

It is an error to call <b>KeRemoveDeviceQueue</b> when the device queue object is set to a not-busy state.
