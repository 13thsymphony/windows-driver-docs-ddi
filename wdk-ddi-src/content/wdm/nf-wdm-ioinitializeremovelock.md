# IoInitializeRemoveLock function
The <b>IoInitializeRemoveLock</b> routine initializes a remove lock for a device object.

## Syntax

```
void IoInitializeRemoveLock(
   Lock,
   Tag,
   Maxmin,
   HighWater
);
```

## Parameters

`Lock`

Pointer to a caller-supplied <b>IO_REMOVE_LOCK</b> structure that this routine initializes with information about the lock, including a counter and a synchronization event. A driver writer must allocate this structure as part of the device object's device extension.

`Tag`

TBD

`Maxmin`

TBD

`HighWater`

TBD


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

A driver can use a remove lock to track outstanding I/O operations on a device and to determine when the driver can delete its device object in response to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551738">IRP_MN_REMOVE_DEVICE</a> request.

Before calling <b>IoInitializeRemoveLock</b>, a driver should allocate an <b>IO_REMOVE_LOCK</b> structure in its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/9ea59994-1112-4ae5-96a8-fa0670694b53">device extension</a>. A driver typically calls <b>IoInitializeRemoveLock</b> in its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540521">AddDevice</a> routine, when the driver initializes the rest of the device extension for a device object.

After the <b>IoReleaseRemoveLockAndWait</b> routine returns, the driver should consider the device to be in a state in which it is ready to be removed and cannot perform I/O operations. Therefore, the driver must not call <b>IoInitializeRemoveLock</b> to re-initialize the remove lock. Violation of this rule while the driver is being verified by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557262">Driver Verifier</a> will result in a bug check.

Because the driver stores the <b>IO_REMOVE_LOCK</b> structure in the device extension of a device object, the remove lock is deleted when the driver deletes the device extension as part of processing an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551738">IRP_MN_REMOVE_DEVICE</a> request.
