# ExAllocateFromLookasideListEx function
The <b>ExAllocateFromLookasideListEx</b> routine removes the first entry from the specified lookaside list, or, if the list is empty, dynamically allocates the storage for a new entry.

## Syntax

````
PVOID ExAllocateFromLookasideListEx(
  _Inout_ PLOOKASIDE_LIST_EX Lookaside
);
````

## Parameters

`Lookaside`

A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554329">LOOKASIDE_LIST_EX</a> structure that describes a lookaside list. This structure was previously initialized by the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exinitializelookasidelistex.md">ExInitializeLookasideListEx</a> routine.


## Return Value

<b>ExAllocateFromLookasideListEx</b> returns a pointer to a lookaside-list entry, if an entry is available in the list or can be dynamically allocated. Otherwise, this routine returns <b>NULL</b>.

## Remarks

This routine removes the first entry, if an entry is available, from the specified lookaside list and returns a pointer to this entry. If the list is empty, the routine allocates storage for a new entry and returns a pointer to this entry. If this allocation fails, the routine returns <b>NULL</b>.

If the lookaside list is empty, <b>ExAllocateFromLookasideListEx</b> calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554322">LookasideListAllocateEx</a> routine to allocate storage for a new entry, if the driver has provided such a routine. Otherwise, a default allocation routine is used to allocate the entry.

After the caller finishes using the entry, it should free the entry by calling the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exfreetolookasidelistex.md">ExFreeToLookasideListEx</a> routine.

In the current implementation, a lookaside list operates as a last-in, first-out (LIFO) stack. Thus, the last entry to be freed (and pushed onto the stack) is the next entry to be allocated (popped) from the list.

For more information about lookaside lists, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565416">Using Lookaside Lists</a>.
