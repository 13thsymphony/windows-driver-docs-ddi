# IoReleaseRemoveLock function
The <b>IoReleaseRemoveLock</b> routine releases a remove lock acquired with a previous call to <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-ioacquireremovelock.md">IoAcquireRemoveLock</a>.

## Syntax

````
VOID IoReleaseRemoveLock(
  _In_ PIO_REMOVE_LOCK RemoveLock,
  _In_ PVOID           Tag
);
````

## Parameters

`RemoveLock`

Pointer to an <b>IO_REMOVE_LOCK</b> structure that the caller passed to a previous call to <b>IoAcquireRemoveLock</b>.

`Tag`

Pointer to a caller-supplied tag that was passed to a previous call to <b>IoAcquireRemoveLock</b>. 

If a driver specified a <i>Tag</i> when it acquired the lock, the driver must specify the same <i>Tag</i> when releasing the lock. If the tags do not match, this routine asserts on a checked build.

If the call to <b>IoAcquireRemoveLock</b> did not specify a <i>Tag</i>, then this parameter is <b>NULL</b>.

The I/O system only uses this parameter on checked builds.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

A driver calls <b>IoReleaseRemoveLock</b> when it has completed the I/O operation for which it called <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-ioacquireremovelock.md">IoAcquireRemoveLock</a>.

<ul>
<li>
For I/O operations (including power and PnP IRPs) that set an <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-io_completion_routine.md">IoCompletion</a> routine, a driver should call <b>IoReleaseRemoveLock</b> in the <i>IoCompletion</i> routine, after calling <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iocompleterequest.md">IoCompleteRequest</a>.

</li>
<li>
For I/O operations that do not set an <i>IoCompletion</i> routine, a driver should call <b>IoReleaseRemoveLock</b> after passing the current IRP to the next-lower driver, but before exiting the dispatch routine.

</li>
</ul>
Each call to <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-ioacquireremovelock.md">IoAcquireRemoveLock</a> must have a corresponding call to <b>IoReleaseRemoveLock</b>. 

<b>IoReleaseRemoveLock</b> decrements the count of outstanding acquisitions of the remove lock. If the count goes to zero and the driver has received an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551738">IRP_MN_REMOVE_DEVICE</a> request, <b>IoReleaseRemoveLock</b> sets an internal event. When a driver is ready to delete a device object, it calls a similar routine, <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-ioreleaseremovelockandwait.md">IoReleaseRemoveLockAndWait</a>. The driver makes this call only in its dispatch code for an <b>IRP_MN_REMOVE_DEVICE</b> request. The <b>IoReleaseRemoveLockAndWait</b> routine does not return until <b>IoReleaseRemoveLock</b> sets the event that indicates the acquisition count is zero. After <b>IoReleaseRemoveLockAndWait</b> returns, the driver can safely detach and delete the device object.
