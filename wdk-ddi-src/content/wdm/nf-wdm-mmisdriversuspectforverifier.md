# MmIsDriverSuspectForVerifier function
The <b>MmIsDriverSuspectForVerifier</b> routine indicates whether the driver represented by the specified <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/497ee2dc-671d-408e-b228-16dc24532375">driver object</a> is in the list of drivers that are selected to be verified by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557262">Driver Verifier</a>.

## Syntax

````
LOGICAL MmIsDriverSuspectForVerifier(
  _In_ struct _DRIVER_OBJECT *DriverObject
);
````

## Parameters

`DriverObject`

A pointer to the driver object. This object is a <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_driver_object.md">DRIVER_OBJECT</a> structure that represents a loaded driver image. The driver receives this pointer as an input parameter to its <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-driver_initialize.md">DriverEntry</a> routine.


## Return Value

<b>MmIsDriverSuspectForVerifier</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the driver is selected for verification. Otherwise, the routine returns <b>FALSE</b>.

## Remarks

A kernel-mode driver can call this routine to determine whether it is being monitored by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557262">Driver Verifier</a>. Driver Verifier monitors kernel-mode drivers to detect illegal function calls or actions that might corrupt the system. To select drivers to be verified, you can use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7cdf5277-7187-4e90-b22a-6f828f06e2fb">Verifier Command Line</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/37a7d348-8b55-44f7-86d6-6b195704b9fd">Driver Verifier Manager</a>. For more information about adding drivers to the driver verification list, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a752dea1-f49c-4e58-9e56-6b54701c760e">Selecting Drivers to be Verified</a>.

A related routine, <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-mmisdriververifying.md">MmIsDriverVerifying</a>, returns <b>TRUE</b> if the specified driver either is in the driver verification list or imports calls to entry points in a driver that is in the driver verification list. Otherwise, <b>MmIsDriverVerifying</b> returns <b>FALSE</b>.

For example, if driver A has an import table through which it calls one or more entry points in driver B, and driver B is in the driver verification list, then <code>MmIsDriverVerifying(A)</code> returns <b>TRUE</b> and <code>MmIsDriverSuspectForVerifier(B)</code> returns <b>TRUE</b>. If driver A is not in the driver verification list, <code>MmIsDriverSuspectForVerifier(A)</code> returns <b>FALSE</b>. Even if driver B does not call entry points in any drivers that are in the driver verification list, <code>MmIsDriverVerifying(B)</code> returns <b>TRUE</b> because driver B is in the driver verification list. If a driver C is not in the driver verification list and does not call entry points in any drivers that are in the driver verification list, <code>MmIsDriverVerifying(C)</code> and <code>MmIsDriverSuspectForVerifier(C)</code> both return <b>FALSE</b>.

Another related routine, <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-mmisdriververifyingbyaddress.md">MmIsDriverVerifyingByAddress</a>, indicates whether a driver identified by a driver image address is being verified or calls a driver that is being verified. <b>MmIsDriverVerifyingByAddress</b> is available starting with Windows Vista.
