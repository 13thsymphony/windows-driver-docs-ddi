# IoInvalidateDeviceState function
The <b>IoInvalidateDeviceState</b> routine notifies the PnP manager that some aspect of the PnP state of a device has changed.

## Syntax

```
NTKERNELAPI VOID IoInvalidateDeviceState(
  PDEVICE_OBJECT PhysicalDeviceObject
);
```

## Parameters

`PhysicalDeviceObject`

Pointer to the PDO for the device.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

Drivers call this routine to indicate that something has changed with respect to one of the following aspects of a device's PnP state:

PNP_DEVICE_DISABLED

PNP_DEVICE_DONT_DISPLAY_IN_UI

PNP_DEVICE_FAILED

PNP_DEVICE_NOT_DISABLEABLE

PNP_DEVICE_REMOVED

PNP_DEVICE_RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS_CHANGED

For descriptions of the preceding constants, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559618">PNP_DEVICE_STATE</a>.

In response to this routine, the PnP manager sends an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551698">IRP_MN_QUERY_PNP_DEVICE_STATE</a> request to the device stack, to determine the current PnP state of the device.
