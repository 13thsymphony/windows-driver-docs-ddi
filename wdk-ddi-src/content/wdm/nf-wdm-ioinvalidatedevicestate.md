# IoInvalidateDeviceState function



## -description
The <b>IoInvalidateDeviceState</b> routine notifies the PnP manager that some aspect of the PnP state of a device has changed. 



## -syntax

````
VOID IoInvalidateDeviceState(
  _In_ PDEVICE_OBJECT PhysicalDeviceObject
);
````


## -parameters

### -param PhysicalDeviceObject [in]

Pointer to the PDO for the device. 


## -returns
None


## -remarks
Drivers call this routine to indicate that something has changed with respect to one of the following aspects of a device's PnP state:

PNP_DEVICE_DISABLED

PNP_DEVICE_DONT_DISPLAY_IN_UI

PNP_DEVICE_FAILED

PNP_DEVICE_NOT_DISABLEABLE

PNP_DEVICE_REMOVED

PNP_DEVICE_RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS_CHANGED

For descriptions of the preceding constants, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559618">PNP_DEVICE_STATE</a>.

In response to this routine, the PnP manager sends an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551698">IRP_MN_QUERY_PNP_DEVICE_STATE</a> request to the device stack, to determine the current PnP state of the device.
