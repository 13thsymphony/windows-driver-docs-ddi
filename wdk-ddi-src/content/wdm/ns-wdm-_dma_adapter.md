# _DMA_ADAPTER structure
The <b>DMA_ADAPTER</b> structure describes a system-defined interface to a DMA controller for a given device. A driver calls <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iogetdmaadapter.md">IoGetDmaAdapter</a> to obtain this structure.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _DMA_ADAPTER {
  USHORT          Version;
  USHORT          Size;
  PDMA_OPERATIONS DmaOperations;
} DMA_ADAPTER, *PDMA_ADAPTER;
````

## Members


`DmaOperations`

Pointer to a <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_dma_operations.md">DMA_OPERATIONS</a> structure that contains pointers to DMA adapter functions. The version of the <b>DMA_OPERATIONS</b> structure that this member points to is determined by the version of the <b>DMA_ADAPTER</b> structure. Thus, for version 1 of the <b>DMA_ADAPTER</b> structure, <i>DmaOperations</i> points to version 1 of the <b>DMA_OPERATIONS</b> structure, and so on. For more information about structure versions, see the following Remarks section.

`Size`

Specifies the size, in bytes, of this structure.

`Version`

Specifies the version of this structure. Version 3 of the <b>DMA_ADAPTER</b> structure is available starting with Windows 8. For versions 1 and 2 of this structure, this member is set to the value 1. For more information, see the following Remarks section.

## Remarks
Drivers for devices that use DMA to transfer data use this structure to obtain the addresses of functions that enable use of a DMA controller. Usually, drivers obtain this structure by calling the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iogetdmaadapter.md">IoGetDmaAdapter</a> routine. Drivers can also obtain this structure by querying for the <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_bus_interface_standard.md">BUS_INTERFACE_STANDARD</a> interface.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  When the <b>IoGetDmaAdapter</b> routine returns a pointer to version 1 or version 2 of the <b>DMA_ADAPTER</b> structure, this routine always sets the <b>Version</b> member of this structure to 1. Thus, the caller cannot use the <b>Version</b> member to distinguish between versions 1 and 2 of the <b>DMA_ADAPTER</b> structure. For more information about how to determine the version of a <b>DMA_ADAPTER</b> structure that is returned by this routine, see <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iogetdmaadapter.md">IoGetDmaAdapter</a>.</div>
