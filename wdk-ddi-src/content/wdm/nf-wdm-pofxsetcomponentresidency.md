# PoFxSetComponentResidency function



## -description
The <b>PoFxSetComponentResidency</b> routine sets the estimated time for how long a component is likely to remain idle after the component enters the idle condition.



## -syntax

````
VOID PoFxSetComponentResidency(
  _In_ POHANDLE  Handle,
  _In_ ULONG     Component,
  _In_ ULONGLONG Residency
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Handle [in]

A handle that represents the registration of the device with the power management framework (PoFx). The device driver previously received this handle from the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-pofxregisterdevice.md">PoFxRegisterDevice</a> routine.


### -param Component [in]

The index that identifies the component. This parameter is an index into the <b>Components</b> array in the <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_po_fx_device_v1.md">PO_FX_DEVICE</a> structure that the device driver used to register the device with PoFx. If the <b>Components</b> array contains N elements, component indexes range from 0 to N–1.


### -param Residency [in]

The estimated residency time, in 100-nanosecond units. This parameter is a hint to PoFx about how long the component is likely to remain idle after a transition from the active condition to the idle condition. For more information, see Remarks.


## -returns
None.


## -remarks
The calling driver supplies an estimated residency time that PoFx can use as a hint to improve performance. PoFx uses this hint to select an appropriate low-power Fx state for a component that is in the idle condition.

The device driver can call <b>PoFxSetComponentResidency</b> each time a change in circumstances requires a change in the estimated residency time. After each call, the new estimated residency time remains in effect until the driver calls <b>PoFxSetComponentResidency</b> again to update it.

If a component is in the idle condition when <b>PoFxSetComponentResidency</b> is called, PoFx might change the component’s Fx state to accommodate the new estimated residency time specified by the caller.
