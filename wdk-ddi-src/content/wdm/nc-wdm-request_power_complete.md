# REQUEST_POWER_COMPLETE function
The <i>PowerCompletion</i> callback routine completes the processing of a power IRP.

## Syntax

```
REQUEST_POWER_COMPLETE RequestPowerComplete;

_IRQL_requires_same_ VOID RequestPowerComplete(
  PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject,
  UCHAR MinorFunction,
  POWER_STATE PowerState,
  PVOID Context,
  PIO_STATUS_BLOCK IoStatus
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`DeviceObject`

A pointer to the target <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_device_object.md">DEVICE_OBJECT</a> for the completed power IRP.

`MinorFunction`

Specifies the minor function code in the power IRP. For more information, see the list of supported <b>IRP_MN_<i>XXX</i></b> codes in the Remarks section.

`PowerState`

Specifies the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2229f34c-9b88-4e3e-802e-f7be2c7ef168">device power state</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/bb30bc89-d1f2-4cb3-bcfb-fb76c69dba27">system power state</a> that was passed to the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-porequestpowerirp.md">PoRequestPowerIrp</a> routine.

`Context`

A pointer to the context that was passed to <b>PoRequestPowerIrp</b>.

`IoStatus`

A pointer to the <a href="..\wudfwdm\ns-wudfwdm-_io_status_block.md">IO_STATUS_BLOCK</a> structure for the completed IRP.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

A driver that sends a power IRP might need to perform additional tasks after all other drivers have completed the IRP. If so, the sending driver should register a <i>PowerCompletion</i> callback routine during the call to the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-porequestpowerirp.md">PoRequestPowerIrp</a> routine that allocates the IRP.

A driver's <i>PowerCompletion</i> callback routine is used only for <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550784">IRP_MJ_POWER</a> IRPs that have minor IRP codes of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551744">IRP_MN_SET_POWER</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551699">IRP_MN_QUERY_POWER</a>, and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551766">IRP_MN_WAIT_WAKE</a>. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563731">Sending IRP_MN_QUERY_POWER or IRP_MN_SET_POWER for Device Power States</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565599">Wait/Wake Callback Routines</a>.

The I/O manager calls the sending driver's <i>PowerCompletion</i> routine only after the I/O manager has called all the <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-io_completion_routine.md">IoCompletion</a> routines that were set by other drivers as they passed the IRP down the stack. The <i>PowerCompletion</i> routine performs any additional tasks that the sender of the IRP requires after all other drivers have completed the IRP. The <i>PowerCompletion</i> routine should not free the IRP—the power manager does that.

In Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows, the <i>PowerCompletion</i> routine is called at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL or IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL. In Windows 98/Me, the <i>PowerCompletion</i> routine is always called at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL, and drivers must complete IRPs at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL.



#### Examples

To define a <i>PowerCompletion</i> callback routine, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of callback routine you're defining. Windows provides a set of callback function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the callback function types helps <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2F3549EF-B50F-455A-BDC7-1F67782B8DCA">Code Analysis for Drivers</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/74feeb16-387c-4796-987a-aff3fb79b556">Static Driver Verifier</a> (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it's a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

For example, to define a <i>PowerCompletion</i> callback routine that is named <code>MyPowerCompletion</code>, use the REQUEST_POWER_COMPLETE type as shown in this code example:

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>REQUEST_POWER_COMPLETE MyPowerCompletion;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
Then, implement your callback routine as follows:

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>_Use_decl_annotations_
VOID
  MyPowerCompletion(
    PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject,
    UCHAR MinorFunction,
    POWER_STATE PowerState,
    PVOID Context,
    PIO_STATUS_BLOCK IoStatus
    )
  {
      // Function body
  }</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
The REQUEST_POWER_COMPLETE function type is defined in the Wdm.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation to your function definition. The _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the REQUEST_POWER_COMPLETE function type in the header file are used. For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3260b53e-82be-4dbc-8ac5-d0e52de77f9d">Declaring Functions by Using Function Role Types for WDM Drivers</a>. For information about _Use_decl_annotations_, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=286697">Annotating Function Behavior</a>.
