# _SCATTER_GATHER_LIST structure
The <b>SCATTER_GATHER_LIST</b> structure describes the scatter/gather list for a DMA operation.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _SCATTER_GATHER_LIST {
  ULONG                  NumberOfElements;
  ULONG_PTR              Reserved;
  SCATTER_GATHER_ELEMENT Elements[];
} SCATTER_GATHER_LIST, *PSCATTER_GATHER_LIST;
````

## Members


`Elements`

Specifies an array of scatter/gather elements that comprise a scatter/gather list. Each array element is a structure of type <b>SCATTER_GATHER_ELEMENT</b>, which is defined as follows:

<pre class="syntax" xml:space="preserve"><code>typedef struct _SCATTER_GATHER_ELEMENT {
  PHYSICAL_ADDRESS  Address;
  ULONG  Length;
  ULONG_PTR  Reserved;
} SCATTER_GATHER_ELEMENT, *PSCATTER_GATHER_ELEMENT;</code></pre>
The <b>SCATTER_GATHER_ELEMENT</b> structure specifies the length, in bytes, of a physically contiguous scatter/gather region and the starting physical address of this region.

`NumberOfElements`

Specifies the number of elements in the <b>Elements</b> array.

`Reserved`

Reserved for future use.

## Remarks
For a driver that performs scatter/gather DMA, the <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pget_scatter_gather_list.md">GetScatterGatherList</a> or <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pbuild_scatter_gather_list.md">BuildScatterGatherList</a> routine creates a scatter/gather list and passes this list to the driver's <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-driver_list_control.md">AdapterListControl</a> routine. This scatter/gather list consists of a <b>SCATTER_GATHER_LIST</b> structure that is immediately followed in memory by a <b>SCATTER_GATHER_ELEMENT</b> array. The number of elements in this array is specified by the <b>NumberOfElements</b> member of the <b>SCATTER_GATHER_LIST</b> structure.

For more information about scatter/gather lists, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565510">Using Scatter/Gather DMA</a>.
