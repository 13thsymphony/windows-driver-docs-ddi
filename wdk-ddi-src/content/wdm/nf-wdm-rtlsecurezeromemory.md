# RtlSecureZeroMemory function
The <b>RtlSecureZeroMemory</b> routine fills a block of memory with zeros in a way that is guaranteed to be secure.

## Syntax

````
PVOID RtlSecureZeroMemory(
  _Out_ PVOID  ptr,
  _In_  SIZE_T cnt
);
````

## Parameters

`ptr`

Pointer to the memory buffer to be filled with zeros.

`cnt`

Specifies the number of bytes to be filled with zeros.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

The effect of <b>RtlSecureZeroMemory</b> is identical to that of <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-rtlzeromemory.md">RtlZeroMemory</a>, except that it is guaranteed to zero the memory location, even if it is not subsequently written to. (The compiler can optimize away a call to <b>RtlZeroMemory</b>, if it determines that the caller does not access that memory range again.)

Use <b>RtlSecureZeroMemory</b> to guarantee that sensitive information has been zeroed out. For example, suppose that a function uses a local array variable to store password information. Once the function exits, the password information can remain in the same memory location unless zeroed out by <b>RtlSecureZeroMemory</b>.

<b>RtlSecureZeroMemory</b> is slower than <b>RtlZeroMemory</b>; therefore, if security is not an issue, use <b>RtlZeroMemory</b> instead.

Callers of <b>RtlSecureZeroMemory</b> can be running at any IRQL if the <i>ptr</i> block is in nonpaged pool. Otherwise, the caller must be running at IRQL &lt;= APC_LEVEL.
