# _DEVICE_REMOVAL_POLICY Enumeration
The <b>DEVICE_REMOVAL_POLICY</b> enumeration describes a device's removal policy.

## Syntax
```
typedef enum _DEVICE_REMOVAL_POLICY {
  RemovalPolicyExpectNoRemoval        ,
  RemovalPolicyExpectOrderlyRemoval   ,
  RemovalPolicyExpectSurpriseRemoval
} DEVICE_REMOVAL_POLICY, *PDEVICE_REMOVAL_POLICY;
```

## Constants

<table>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>RemovalPolicyExpectNoRemoval</td>
                    <td>The device is not typically removed.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>RemovalPolicyExpectOrderlyRemoval</td>
                    <td>The device is typically removed in an orderly fashion. (Before the device is removed, the Plug and Play [PnP] manager sends an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551705">IRP_MN_QUERY_REMOVE_DEVICE</a> request to the device's driver.)</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>RemovalPolicyExpectSurpriseRemoval</td>
                    <td>The device can be removed suddenly. (The driver receives no advance warning that the device will be removed. The Plug and Play [PnP] manager sends an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551760">IRP_MN_SURPRISE_REMOVAL</a> request when the device is removed.)</td>
                </tr>
</table>

## Remarks

The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549203">IoGetDeviceProperty</a> routine supplies a <b>DEVICE_REMOVAL_POLICY</b> enumeration value when a driver requests <b>DevicePropertyRemovalPolicy</b>. The operating system uses the value as a hint as to how the device is typically removed from the computer.
