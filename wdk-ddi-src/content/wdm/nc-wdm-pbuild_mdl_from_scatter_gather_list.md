# PBUILD_MDL_FROM_SCATTER_GATHER_LIST callback function
The <b>BuildMdlFromScatterGatherList</b> routine builds an MDL from a scatter/gather list allocated by the system.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This routine is reserved for system use.</div><div> </div>

## Syntax

```
PBUILD_MDL_FROM_SCATTER_GATHER_LIST PbuildMdlFromScatterGatherList;

NTSTATUS PbuildMdlFromScatterGatherList(
  PDMA_ADAPTER DmaAdapter,
  PSCATTER_GATHER_LIST ScatterGather,
  PMDL OriginalMdl,
  PMDL *TargetMdl
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`DmaAdapter`

Pointer to the <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_dma_adapter.md">DMA_ADAPTER</a> structure returned by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549220">IoGetDmaAdapter</a> that represents the bus-master adapter or DMA controller.

`ScatterGather`

Pointer to the <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_scatter_gather_list.md">SCATTER_GATHER_LIST</a> structure passed to the driver's <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-driver_list_control.md">AdapterListControl</a> routine.

`OriginalMdl`

Pointer to the original MDL that the driver used to build the scatter/gather list.

`*TargetMdl`

Pointer to a variable the routine uses to return the MDL created to hold the buffer described by the scatter/gather list. The value returned can be the same as <i>OriginalMdl</i>.


## Return Value

<b>BuildMdlFromScatterGatherList</b> returns one of the following status codes:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The operation succeeded.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The <i>OriginalMdl</i> parameter is <b>NULL</b>.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
There is not enough memory available to allocate a new MDL.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_NONE_MAPPED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The system has already created a new MDL for the memory locations in the scatter/gather list. (This only happens if the routine is called twice on the same scatter/gather list.)

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

<b>BuildMdlFromScatterGatherList</b>
           is not a system routine that can be called directly by name. This routine can be called only by pointer from the address returned in a 
          <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_dma_operations.md">DMA_OPERATIONS</a>
           structure. Drivers obtain the address of this routine by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549220">IoGetDmaAdapter</a> with the <b>Version</b> member of the <i>DeviceDescription</i> parameter set to DEVICE_DESCRIPTION_VERSION2. If <b>IoGetDmaAdapter</b> returns <b>NULL</b>, the routine is not available on your platform.

When a driver creates a scatter/gather list to write to a device, the system can make a copy of the data to be written, and use that copy to perform the DMA operation. Use this routine to access the memory locations in the scatter/gather list, regardless of whether those locations are a copy.

## Requirements
