# PO_FX_COMPONENT_IDLE_CONDITION_CALLBACK function
The <i>ComponentIdleConditionCallback</i> callback routine notifies the driver that the specified component completed a transition from the active condition to the idle condition.

## Syntax

```
PO_FX_COMPONENT_IDLE_CONDITION_CALLBACK PoFxComponentIdleConditionCallback;

void PoFxComponentIdleConditionCallback(
  PVOID Context,
  ULONG Component
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Context`

A pointer to the device context. The device driver uses this context to store information about the current power state of the device. The device driver specified this pointer in the <b>DeviceContext</b> member of the <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_po_fx_device_v1.md">PO_FX_DEVICE</a> structure that the driver used to register the device with the power management framework (PoFx). This context is opaque to PoFx.

`Component`

The index that identifies the component. This parameter is an index into the <b>Components</b> array in the <b>PO_FX_DEVICE</b> structure that the device driver used to register the device with PoFx. If the <b>Components</b> array contains N elements, component indexes range from 0 to N–1.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

When the driver no longer needs to access a component that is in the active condition, the driver should call the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-pofxidlecomponent.md">PoFxIdleComponent</a> routine to switch the component to the idle condition. In response to the <b>PoFxIdleComponent</b> call, PoFx initiates the transition to the idle condition, and then calls the <i>ComponentIdleConditionCallback</i> routine to notify the driver when this transition is complete.

The driver must call <b>PoFxCompleteIdleCondition</b> in response to every <i>ComponentIdleConditionCallback</i> callback. The <b>PoFxCompleteIdleCondition</b> call can occur either during the <i>ComponentIdleConditionCallback</i> callback or after the callback returns. The driver should complete any work that requires access to the hardware component before the call to <b>PoFxCompleteIdleCondition</b>. After this call, the component might not stay in the F0 power state.

A component can be safely accessed only when the component is in the active condition. Do not rely on the Fx power state of a component to determine whether the component can be accessed. If the component is in the F0 state and is in the idle condition, the component might be about to switch to another Fx state.
