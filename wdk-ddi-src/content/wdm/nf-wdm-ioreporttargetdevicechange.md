# IoReportTargetDeviceChange function
The <b>IoReportTargetDeviceChange</b> routine notifies the PnP manager that a custom event has occurred on a device.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS IoReportTargetDeviceChange(
  _In_ PDEVICE_OBJECT PhysicalDeviceObject,
  _In_ PVOID          NotificationStructure
);
````

## Parameters

`PhysicalDeviceObject`

Pointer to the PDO of the device being reported.

`NotificationStructure`

Pointer to a caller-supplied <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_target_device_custom_notification.md">TARGET_DEVICE_CUSTOM_NOTIFICATION</a> structure describing the custom event. The PnP manager sends this structure to drivers that registered for notification of the event.

<i>NotificationStructure</i>.<b>FileObject</b> must be <b>NULL</b>. <i>NotificationStructure</i>.<b>Event</b> must contain the custom GUID for the event. The other fields of the <i>NotificationStructure</i> must be filled in as appropriate for the custom event.

The PnP manager fills in the <i>NotificationStructure</i>.<b>FileObject</b> field when it sends notifications to registrants.


## Return Value

<b>IoReportTargetDeviceChange</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS or an appropriate error status. Possible error status values include the following.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_REQUEST</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The caller specified a system PnP event, such as GUID_TARGET_DEVICE_QUERY_REMOVE. This routine is only for custom events.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

After <b>IoReportTargetDeviceChange</b> notifies the PnP manager that a custom event has occurred on a device, the PnP manager sends notification of the event to drivers that registered for notification on the device. Do not use this routine to report system PnP events, such as GUID_TARGET_DEVICE_REMOVE_COMPLETE.

A driver that defines a custom device event calls <b>IoReportTargetDeviceChange</b> to inform the PnP manager that the custom event has occurred. Custom notification can be used for events like a volume label change.

A driver should call the asynchronous form of this routine, <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-ioreporttargetdevicechangeasynchronous.md">IoReportTargetDeviceChangeAsynchronous</a>, instead of this routine, to prevent deadlocks.

Certain kernel-mode components can call this synchronous routine. For example, a file system can call <b>IoReportTargetDeviceChange</b> to report a "get off the volume" custom event when a component tries to open the volume for exclusive access. Clients that register for notification on file system volumes are careful to not request an exclusive open in a PnP notification callback routine.

The custom notification structure contains a driver-defined event with its own GUID. Driver writers can generate GUIDs with Uuidgen.exe or Guidgen.exe (which are included in the Microsoft Windows SDK).

Callers of <b>IoReportTargetDeviceChange</b> must be running at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL in the context of a system thread. To report a target device change from IRQL &gt; PASSIVE_LEVEL, call <b>IoReportTargetDeviceChangeAsynchronous</b>.

<b>IoReportTargetDeviceChange</b> is not supported on Windows 98/Me; it returns STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.
