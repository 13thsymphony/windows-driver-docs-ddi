# PoFxCompleteDevicePowerNotRequired function
The <b>PoFxCompleteDevicePowerNotRequired</b> routine notifies the power management framework (PoFx) that the calling driver has completed its response to a call to the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh450946">DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback</a> callback routine.

## Syntax

````
VOID PoFxCompleteDevicePowerNotRequired(
  _In_ POHANDLE Handle
);
````

## Parameters

`Handle`

A handle that represents the registration of the device with PoFx. The device driver previously received this handle from the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-pofxregisterdevice.md">PoFxRegisterDevice</a> routine.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

After PoFx calls the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh450946">DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback</a> callback routine, the driver must respond by calling <b>PoFxCompleteDevicePowerNotRequired</b>.

PoFx calls the driver's <i>DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback</i> routine to inform the driver that the device is no longer required to remain in the D0 state. In response to this call, the driver can choose to enter a low-power Dx state or to remain in the D0 state. After the driver has completed its response to the <i>DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback</i> call, the driver calls <b>PoFxCompleteDevicePowerNotRequired</b> to inform PoFx. The <b>PoFxCompleteDevicePowerNotRequired</b> call can occur either during or after the <i>DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback</i> call.
