# DRIVER_CONTROL function



## -description
This routine starts a DMA data-transfer or a data transfer operation. 



## -syntax

````
DRIVER_CONTROL MyControl;

IO_ALLOCATION_ACTION MyControl(
  _In_    struct _DEVICE_OBJECT *DeviceObject,
  _Inout_ struct _IRP           *Irp,
  _In_    PVOID                 MapRegisterBase,
  _In_    PVOID                 Context
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param DeviceObject [in]

Caller-supplied pointer to a <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_device_object.md">DEVICE_OBJECT</a> structure. This is the device object for the target device, previously created by the driver's <i>AddDevice</i> routine.


### -param Irp [in, out]

Caller-supplied pointer to an <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_irp.md">IRP</a> structure. <i>Irp</i> is equal to the value of the <b>CurrentIrp</b> member of <i>DeviceObject</i> when the callback routine was registered.


### -param MapRegisterBase [in]

In the case of <i>AdapterControl</i>, this is a caller-supplied opaque value that represents  the map registers that the system has assigned for this transfer operation. The driver passes this value to <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pflush_adapter_buffers.md">FlushAdapterBuffers</a>, <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pfree_map_registers.md">FreeMapRegisters</a>, and <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pmap_transfer.md">MapTransfer</a>.

In the case of <i>ControllerControl</i>, this is not used.


### -param Context [in]

Caller-supplied pointer to driver-defined context information, specified in a previous call to <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pallocate_adapter_channel.md">AllocateAdapterChannel</a>.


## -returns
The routine must return one of the values defined by the <a href="..\wdm\ne-wdm-_io_allocation_action.md">IO_ALLOCATION_ACTION</a> enumeration. Drivers of bus-master devices return either <b>DeallocateObject</b> or <b>DeallocateObjectKeepRegisters</b>; drivers that use system DMA return <b>KeepObject</b>.


## -remarks
<b>About implementing <i>AdapterControl</i>:  </b><p class="note">To register an <i>AdapterControl</i> routine for a specific device object, a driver must call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549220">IoGetDmaAdapter</a> to obtain an adapter object, then call <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pallocate_adapter_channel.md">AllocateAdapterChannel</a> to request use of the adapter and to supply the <i>AdapterControl</i> routine's address. When the adapter is free, the system calls the <i>AdapterControl</i> routine.

<p class="note">If <i>AdapterControl</i> has been registered by a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563858">StartIo</a> routine, then the <i>Irp</i> parameter is guaranteed to point to the IRP currently being processed by the <i>StartIo</i> routine. Otherwise, drivers must set the <b>CurrentIrp</b> member of the device object structure before calling <b>AllocateAdapterChannel</b>.

<b>About implementing <i>ControllerControl</i>:  </b>A driver's <i>ControllerControl</i> routine executes in an arbitrary thread context at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL.

To register a <i>ControllerControl</i> routine for a specific device object, a driver must call <a href="..\ntddk\nf-ntddk-iocreatecontroller.md">IoCreateController</a> to obtain a controller object, then call <a href="..\ntddk\nf-ntddk-ioallocatecontroller.md">IoAllocateController</a> to request use of the controller and to supply the <i>ControllerControl</i> routine's address. When the controller is free, the system calls the <i>ControllerControl</i> routine.

The DRIVER_CONTROL function type is defined in the Wdm.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation to your function definition. The _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the DRIVER_CONTROL function type in the header file are used. For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3260b53e-82be-4dbc-8ac5-d0e52de77f9d">Declaring Functions by Using Function Role Types for WDM Drivers</a>. For information about _Use_decl_annotations_, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=286697">Annotating Function Behavior</a>.

To define a callback routine, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of callback routine you're defining. Windows provides a set of callback function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the callback function types helps <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2F3549EF-B50F-455A-BDC7-1F67782B8DCA">Code Analysis for Drivers</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/74feeb16-387c-4796-987a-aff3fb79b556">Static Driver Verifier</a> (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it's a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

For example, to define an <i>AdapterControl</i> callback routine that is named <code>MyAdapterControl</code>, use the DRIVER_CONTROL type as shown in this code example:

Then, implement your callback routine as follows:
