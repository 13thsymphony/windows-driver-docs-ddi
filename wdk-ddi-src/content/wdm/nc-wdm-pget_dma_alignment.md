# PGET_DMA_ALIGNMENT callback



## -description
The <b>GetDmaAlignment</b> routine returns the alignment requirements of the DMA system.



## -prototype

````
PGET_DMA_ALIGNMENT GetDmaAlignment;

ULONG GetDmaAlignment(
  _In_ PDMA_ADAPTER DmaAdapter
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param DmaAdapter [in]

A pointer to the <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_dma_adapter.md">DMA_ADAPTER</a> structure returned by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549220">IoGetDmaAdapter</a> that represents the bus-master adapter or DMA controller. 


## -returns
<b>GetDmaAlignment</b> returns the alignment requirements, in bytes, of the DMA system.  The starting address and length of DMA buffers must be a multiple of this value.


## -remarks
<b>GetDmaAlignment</b>
           is not a system routine that can be called directly by name. This routine is callable only by pointer from the address returned in a 
          <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_dma_operations.md">DMA_OPERATIONS</a>
           structure. Drivers obtain the address of this routine by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549220">IoGetDmaAdapter</a>.

A driver can call this routine to determine alignment requirements for DMA buffers it allocates. The returned value should be used to set the <b>AlignmentRequirement</b> field in the device object. A driver may need to increase this value because of additional hardware device restrictions.  For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547807">Initializing a Device Object</a>.
