# ClfsScanLogContainers function
The <b>ClfsScanLogContainers</b> routine retrieves descriptive information for a sequence of containers that belong to a particular CLFS log.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS ClfsScanLogContainers(
  _Inout_ PCLFS_SCAN_CONTEXT pcxScan,
  _In_    CLFS_SCAN_MODE     eScanMode
);
````

## Parameters

`pcxScan`

A pointer to a <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_cls_scan_context.md">CLFS_SCAN_CONTEXT</a> structure. The caller previously allocated the structure and initialized it by calling <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-clfscreatescancontext.md">ClfsCreateScanContext</a>. In particular, the <b>pInfoContainer</b> member was initialized to point to an array of <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_cls_container_information.md">CLFS_CONTAINER_INFORMATION</a> structures, and the <b>cContainers</b> member was initialized to the number of elements in the array. On return, the structures in the array receive descriptive information for the containers in the sequence.

`eScanMode`

A set of flags that specify the direction of the scan and whether the scan context should be closed. The following flags are available to callers of this routine.
<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
CLFS_SCAN_FORWARD

</td>
<td>
Scan in the forward direction. For example, if container 5 is the most recently scanned container and <i>pxcScan</i>-&gt;<b>cContainers</b> is equal to two, this routine will return descriptors for containers 6 and 7.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
CLFS_SCAN_BACKWARD

</td>
<td>
Scan in the backward direction. For example, if container 5 is the most recently scanned container and <i>pxcScan</i>-&gt;<b>cContainers</b> is equal to two, this routine will return descriptors for containers 4 and 3.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
CLFS_SCAN_CLOSE

</td>
<td>
Free all resources associated with the scan context pointed to by <i>pcxScan</i>.

</td>
</tr>
</table> 

If the CLFS_SCAN_CLOSE flag is set, both the CLFS_SCAN_FORWARD and CLFS_SCAN_BACKWARD flags must be clear.

If the CLFS_SCAN_CLOSE flag is clear, only one of the direction flags (CLFS_SCAN_FORWARD or CLFS_SCAN_BACKWARD) must be set.


## Return Value

<b>ClfsScanLogContainers</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if it succeeds; otherwise, it returns one of the error codes defined in Ntstatus.h.

## Remarks

CLFS uses the <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_cls_scan_context.md">CLFS_SCAN_CONTEXT</a> structure to track where a container scan starts (the <b>cIndex</b> member) and how many containers are scanned in each call to <b>ClfsScanLogContainers</b>. The value N of the <b>cContainers</b> member specifies that each time <b>ClfsScanLogContainers</b> is called, the next N containers are scanned.

The <b>cContainersReturned</b> member of the <b>CLFS_SCAN_CONTEXT</b> structure receives the number of containers actually scanned in a single call to <b>ClfsScanLogContainers</b>.

When <b>ClfsScanLogContainers</b> returns STATUS_NO_MORE_ENTRIES, there are no more containers to be scanned.

When you have finished using the scan context pointed to by <i>pcxScan</i>, you must call <b>ClfsScanLogContainers</b>, with <i>eScanMode</i> equal to CLFS_SCAN_CLOSE, to free any resources associated with the scan context.
