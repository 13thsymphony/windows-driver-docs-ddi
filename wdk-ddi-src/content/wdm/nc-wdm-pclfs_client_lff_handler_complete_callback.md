# PCLFS_CLIENT_LFF_HANDLER_COMPLETE_CALLBACK callback function
The <i>ClfsLogGrowthCompleteCallback</i> function implements the actions that the client will take when space is freed in a log that had previously been full.

## Syntax

```
PCLFS_CLIENT_LFF_HANDLER_COMPLETE_CALLBACK PclfsClientLffHandlerCompleteCallback;

void PclfsClientLffHandlerCompleteCallback(
  PLOG_FILE_OBJECT LogFile,
  NTSTATUS OperationStatus,
  BOOLEAN LogIsPinned,
  PVOID ClientData
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`LogFile`

A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554316">LOG_FILE_OBJECT</a> structure that represents the CLFS log stream whose log has finished growing.

`OperationStatus`

The status of the client's earlier request to handle a log file full condition. This will be either STATUS_SUCCESS or an error status that indicates the reason that the request could not be completed successfully.

`LogIsPinned`

If <b>TRUE</b>, specifies that the log tail is currently pinned;  <b>FALSE</b> if the log tail is not pinned.

`ClientData`

A pointer to client-supplied information.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

Because a call to <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-clfsmgmthandlelogfilefull.md">ClfsMgmtHandleLogFileFull</a> completes asynchronously, any actions that the client will take when the log file full condition has been handled belong in the <i>ClfsLogGrowthCompleteCallback</i> function.

If a call to the <b>ClfsMgmtHandleLogFileFull</b> routine returned returns STATUS_PENDING, then the <i>ClfsLogGrowthCompleteCallback</i> function will be invoked when the operation completes. If a different status was returned, then the <i>ClfsLogGrowthCompleteCallback</i> function will not be invoked.

The <i>ClfsLogGrowthCompleteCallback</i> function should only perform a minimal amount of processing before returning. For example, the <i>ClfsLogGrowthCompleteCallback</i> function might follow the following procedure:

<ol>
<li>
If the value of the <i>OperationStatus</i> parameter is an error status, return.

</li>
<li>
If the value of the <i>OperationStatus</i> parameter is STATUS_SUCCESS, create and queue a work item to inform the client that it can resume processing.

</li>
</ol>
When a client uses the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-clfsmgmtregistermanagedclient.md">ClfsMgmtRegisterManagedClient</a> routine to register with CLFS management, the client provides both a pointer to the <i>ClfsLogGrowthCompleteCallback</i> function and the custom data that will be passed as a parameter to the <i>ClfsLogGrowthCompleteCallback</i> function when this function is called.
