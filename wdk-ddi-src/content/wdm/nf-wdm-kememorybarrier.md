# KeMemoryBarrier function
The <b>KeMemoryBarrier</b> routine creates a barrier at its position in the code—across which the compiler and the processor cannot move any operations.

## Syntax

````
VOID KeMemoryBarrier(void);
````

## Parameters

This function has no parameters.

## Return Value

None

## Remarks

The <b>KeMemoryBarrier</b> routine inserts a memory barrier into your code. This barrier guarantees that every operation that appears in the source code before the call to <b>KeMemoryBarrier</b> will complete before any operation that appears after the call.

The implementation of the <b>KeMemoryBarrier</b> routine depends on the processor architecture. For example, for an x86 processor, the Wdm.h header file defines <b>KeMemoryBarrier</b> to be the following inline function:
<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>FORCEINLINE
VOID
KeMemoryBarrier (
    VOID
    )
{
    LONG Barrier;

    __asm {
        xchg Barrier, eax
    }
}</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>In this definition, the braces that follow the <b>__asm</b> keyword contain inline assembly code. The compiler optimizer cannot move an instruction from a position before the inline assembly code to a position after the inline assembly code, and vice versa. In addition, the <b>xchg</b> instruction implicitly includes the <b>lock</b> prefix, which forces the processor hardware to complete the memory operations for all instructions that precede the <b>xchg</b> instruction before it initiates memory operations for instructions that follow the <b>xchg</b> instruction.

<b>KeMemoryBarrier</b> prevents both the compiler and the processor from moving operations across the barrier. To prevent only the compiler from moving operations, call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552973">KeMemoryBarrierWithoutFence</a>.
