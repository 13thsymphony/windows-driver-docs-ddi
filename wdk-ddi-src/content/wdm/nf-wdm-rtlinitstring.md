# RtlInitString function
The <b>RtlInitString</b> routine initializes a counted string of 8-bit characters.

## Syntax

````
VOID RtlInitString(
  _Out_    PSTRING DestinationString,
  _In_opt_ PCSZ    SourceString
);
````

## Parameters

`DestinationString`

A pointer to the <b>STRING</b> structure to be initialized. The Ntdef.h header file defines this structure to be identical to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540605">ANSI_STRING</a> structure.

`SourceString`

A pointer to a null-terminated character string. This string is used to initialize the counted string pointed to by <i>DestinationString</i>.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

This routine initializes a counted character string.

The routine copies the <i>SourceString</i> pointer value to the <b>Buffer</b> member of the <b>STRING</b> structure pointed to by <i>DestinationString</i>. The <b>Length</b> member of this structure is set to the length, in bytes, of the source string, excluding the terminating null. The <b>MaximumLength</b> member of the structure is set to the length, in bytes, of the source string, including the terminating null. If <i>SourceString</i> is <b>NULL</b>, <b>Length</b> and <b>MaximumLength</b> are both set to zero.

<b>RtlInitString</b> does not alter the source string pointed to by <i>SourceString</i>.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  If the source string is longer than MAXUSHORT - 1 bytes, <b>RtlInitString</b> sets the <b>Length</b> member of the <b>STRING</b> structure pointed to by <i>DestinationString</i> to MAXUSHORT - 1, and sets the <b>MaximumLength</b> member of this structure to MAXUSHORT.  In this case, the <b>Length</b> and <b>MaximumLength</b> values misrepresent the length of the null-terminated source string, and relying on the accuracy of these values is potentially dangerous.</div><div> </div>Callers of <b>RtlInitString</b> can be running at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL if the <i>DestinationString</i> buffer is nonpageable. Usually, callers run at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL because most other <b>Rtl<i>Xxx</i>String</b> routines cannot be called at IRQL &gt; PASSIVE_LEVEL.

The <b>RTL_CONSTANT_STRING</b> macro creates a string or Unicode string structure to hold a counted string.


<pre class="syntax">STRING RTL_CONSTANT_STRING(
  [in]  PCSZ SourceString
);

UNICODE_STRING RTL_CONSTANT_STRING(
  [in]  PCWSTR SourceString
);</pre>




<b>RTL_CONSTANT_STRING</b> returns either a string structure or Unicode string structure.

The <b>RTL_CONSTANT_STRING</b> macro replaces the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-rtlinitansistring.md">RtlInitAnsiString</a>, <b>RtlInitString</b>, and <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-rtlinitunicodestring.md">RtlInitUnicodeString</a> routines when passing a constant string.

You can use <b>RTL_CONSTANT_STRING</b> to initialize global variables.
