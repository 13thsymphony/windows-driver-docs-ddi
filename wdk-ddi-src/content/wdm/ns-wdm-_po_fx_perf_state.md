# _PO_FX_PERF_STATE structure
The <b>PO_FX_PERF_STATE</b> structure represents a performance state for a single component within a device.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _PO_FX_PERF_STATE {
  ULONGLONG Value;
  PVOID     Context;
} PO_FX_PERF_STATE, *PPO_FX_PERF_STATE;
````

## Members


`Context`

A pointer to additional context for the performance state that cannot be presented by the <b>Value</b> member. This data can be shared between the driver and the platform extension plug-in (PEP).

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Using the <b>Context</b> member can hinder the visualization of performance states in Windows Performance Analyzer.</div>
<div> </div>

`Value`

The value of this performance state. The units are specified by the <b>Unit</b> member of the <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_po_fx_component_perf_set.md">PO_FX_COMPONENT_PERF_SET</a> that contains this performance state. For example, if <b>Value</b> is 100000000 and the <b>Unit</b> member of the  <b>PO_FX_COMPONENT_PERF_SET</b> is <b>PoFxPerfStateUnitFrequency</b>, this performance state represents 100 MHz.

## Remarks
The <b>States</b> member of the <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_po_fx_component_perf_set.md">PO_FX_COMPONENT_PERF_SET</a> structure contains an array of <b>PO_FX_PERF_STATE</b> elements.

## Requirements

| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows version** | Supported starting with Windows 10. Supported starting with Windows 10. |
