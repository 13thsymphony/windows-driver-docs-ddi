# FREE_FUNCTION_EX function
The <i>LookasideListFreeEx</i> routine frees the storage for a lookaside-list entry when a client tries to insert the entry into a lookaside list that is full.

## Syntax

```
FREE_FUNCTION_EX FreeFunctionEx;

void FreeFunctionEx(
  __drv_freesMem(Mem)PVOID Buffer,
  PLOOKASIDE_LIST_EX Lookaside
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Buffer`

A pointer to the lookaside-list entry that is to be freed.

`Lookaside`

A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554329">LOOKASIDE_LIST_EX</a> structure that describes the lookaside list. This structure was previously initialized by the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exinitializelookasidelistex.md">ExInitializeLookasideListEx</a> routine.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

A driver that creates a lookaside list can implement a <i>LookasideListFreeEx</i> routine to free previously allocated buffers when the list becomes full and can contain no more buffers. A buffer that is not in use is stored as an entry in the list. All entries in a lookaside list are buffers of a uniform size, which the driver specifies when the list is initialized.

The driver supplies a pointer to a custom <i>LookasideListFreeEx</i> routine as an input parameter in the <b>ExInitializeLookasideListEx</b> call that initializes the lookaside list. If the driver sets this parameter to <b>NULL</b>, the lookaside list uses a default deallocation routine instead.

A driver calls the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exfreetolookasidelistex.md">ExFreeToLookasideListEx</a> routine to insert a previously allocated entry into a lookaside list. If the list is full (that is, if the list already contains the system-determined maximum number of entries), <b>ExFreeToLookasideListEx</b> calls <i>LookasideListFreeEx</i> to free the storage for the entry.

The <i>LookasideListFreeEx</i> routine can use the <i>Lookaside</i> parameter to access private context data that the driver has associated with the lookaside list. For more information, see the code example in <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exinitializelookasidelistex.md">ExInitializeLookasideListEx</a>.

For more information about lookaside lists, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565416">Using Lookaside Lists</a>.

The <i>LookasideListFreeEx</i> routine is called at the same IRQL as the call to <b>ExFreeToLookasideListEx</b> that frees the entry. For a call to free an entry that resides in paged memory, the caller must be running IRQL &lt;= APC_LEVEL. For a call to free an entry that resides in nonpaged memory, the caller must be running IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL.
