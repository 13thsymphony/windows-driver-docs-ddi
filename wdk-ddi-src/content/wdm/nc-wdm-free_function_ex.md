# FREE_FUNCTION_EX callback



## -description
The <i>LookasideListFreeEx</i> routine frees the storage for a lookaside-list entry when a client tries to insert the entry into a lookaside list that is full. 



## -prototype

````
FREE_FUNCTION_EX LookasideListFreeEx;

VOID LookasideListFreeEx(
  _In_    PVOID              Buffer,
  _Inout_ PLOOKASIDE_LIST_EX Lookaside
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param Buffer [in]

A pointer to the lookaside-list entry that is to be freed. 


### -param Lookaside [in, out]

A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554329">LOOKASIDE_LIST_EX</a> structure that describes the lookaside list. This structure was previously initialized by the <a href="kernel.exinitializelookasidelistex">ExInitializeLookasideListEx</a> routine. 


## -returns
None


## -remarks
A driver that creates a lookaside list can implement a <i>LookasideListFreeEx</i> routine to free previously allocated buffers when the list becomes full and can contain no more buffers. A buffer that is not in use is stored as an entry in the list. All entries in a lookaside list are buffers of a uniform size, which the driver specifies when the list is initialized.

The driver supplies a pointer to a custom <i>LookasideListFreeEx</i> routine as an input parameter in the <b>ExInitializeLookasideListEx</b> call that initializes the lookaside list. If the driver sets this parameter to <b>NULL</b>, the lookaside list uses a default deallocation routine instead.

A driver calls the <a href="kernel.exfreetolookasidelistex">ExFreeToLookasideListEx</a> routine to insert a previously allocated entry into a lookaside list. If the list is full (that is, if the list already contains the system-determined maximum number of entries), <b>ExFreeToLookasideListEx</b> calls <i>LookasideListFreeEx</i> to free the storage for the entry.

The <i>LookasideListFreeEx</i> routine can use the <i>Lookaside</i> parameter to access private context data that the driver has associated with the lookaside list. For more information, see the code example in <a href="kernel.exinitializelookasidelistex">ExInitializeLookasideListEx</a>.

For more information about lookaside lists, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565416">Using Lookaside Lists</a>.

The <i>LookasideListFreeEx</i> routine is called at the same IRQL as the call to <b>ExFreeToLookasideListEx</b> that frees the entry. For a call to free an entry that resides in paged memory, the caller must be running IRQL &lt;= APC_LEVEL. For a call to free an entry that resides in nonpaged memory, the caller must be running IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL.

To define a <i>LookasideListFreeEx</i> callback routine, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of callback routine you're defining. Windows provides a set of callback function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the callback function types helps <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2F3549EF-B50F-455A-BDC7-1F67782B8DCA">Code Analysis for Drivers</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/74feeb16-387c-4796-987a-aff3fb79b556">Static Driver Verifier</a> (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it's a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

For example, to define a <i>LookasideListFreeEx</i> callback routine that is named <code>MyLookasideListFreeEx</code>, use the FREE_FUNCTION_EX type as shown in this code example:

Then, implement your callback routine as follows:

The FREE_FUNCTION_EX function type is defined in the Wdm.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation to your function definition. The _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the FREE_FUNCTION_EX function type in the header file are used. For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3260b53e-82be-4dbc-8ac5-d0e52de77f9d">Declaring Functions by Using Function Role Types for WDM Drivers</a>. For information about _Use_decl_annotations_, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=286697">Annotating Function Behavior</a>.
