# KeRevertToUserAffinityThreadEx function
The <b>KeRevertToUserAffinityThreadEx</b> routine restores the previous affinity of the current thread.

## Syntax

```
NTKERNELAPI VOID KeRevertToUserAffinityThreadEx(
  KAFFINITY Affinity
);
```

## Parameters

`Affinity`

A <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551830">KAFFINITY</a>-typed variable that specifies the new system affinity of the current thread. Set this parameter to the value that was returned by a previous call to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553271">KeSetSystemAffinityThreadEx</a> routine.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

<b>KeRevertToUserAffinityThreadEx</b> changes the affinity of the current thread. The affinity value is a mask that identifies a set of processors on which the thread can run. If successful, the routine schedules the thread to run on a processor in this set.

If the <i>Affinity</i> value is nonzero, <b>KeRevertToUserAffinityThreadEx</b> sets the affinity mask of the thread to the <i>Affinity</i> value. If the <i>Affinity</i> value is zero, <b>KeRevertToUserAffinityThreadEx</b> restores the original user affinity mask of the thread. This original user affinity mask was saved in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/698de86b-1790-42d5-a482-82e4431ce7af">thread object</a> by a previous call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553271">KeSetSystemAffinityThreadEx</a>. A call to <b>KeRevertToUserAffinityThreadEx</b> has no effect unless it is preceded by a call to <b>KeSetSystemAffinityThreadEx</b>.

If the <i>Affinity</i> value is nonzero, the routine changes the affinity mask of the current thread to the <i>Affinity</i> value only if both of the following are true:

<ul>
<li>
The <i>Affinity</i> value is valid (that is, only mask bits that correspond to logical processors are set).

</li>
<li>
At least one of the processors that is specified in the <i>Affinity</i> value is active.

</li>
</ul>
If either of these conditions is not met, the call to <b>KeRevertToUserAffinityThreadEx</b> has no effect.

Windows 7 and later versions of Windows support processor groups. Drivers that are designed to handle information about processor groups should use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553195">KeRevertToUserGroupAffinityThread</a> routine, which specifies a processor group, instead of <b>KeRevertToUserAffinityThreadEx</b>, which does not. However, the implementation of <b>KeRevertToUserAffinityThreadEx</b> in Windows 7 and later versions of Windows provides compatibility for drivers that were written for earlier versions of Windows, which do not support processor groups. In this implementation, a nonzero <i>Affinity</i> value is an affinity mask that specifies a set of logical processors in group 0 on which the thread can run. If <i>Affinity</i> is zero, the thread reverts to its original user-mode group number and affinity mask.

If <b>KeRevertToUserAffinityThreadEx</b> is called at IRQL &lt;= APC_LEVEL and the call is successful, the new (reverted) affinity mask takes effect immediately. When the call returns, the calling thread is already running on a processor that is specified in the new affinity mask. If <b>KeRevertToUserAffinityThreadEx</b> is called at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL and the call is successful, the pending processor change is deferred until the caller lowers the IRQL below DISPATCH_LEVEL.
