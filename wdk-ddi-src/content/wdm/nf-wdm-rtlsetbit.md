# RtlSetBit function
The <b>RtlSetBit</b> routine sets the specified bit in a bitmap to one.

## Syntax

````
VOID RtlSetBit(
  _In_ PRTL_BITMAP BitMapHeader,
  _In_ ULONG       BitNumber
);
````

## Parameters

`BitMapHeader`

Pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563614">RTL_BITMAP</a> structure that describes the bitmap. This structure must have been initialized by the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-rtlinitializebitmap.md">RtlInitializeBitMap</a> routine.

`BitNumber`

Specifies the zero-based index of the bit within the bitmap. The routine sets this bit to one.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

Callers of <b>RtlSetBit</b> must be running at IRQL &lt;= APC_LEVEL if the memory that contains the bitmap variable is pageable or the memory at <i>BitMapHeader</i> is pageable. Otherwise, <b>RtlSetBit</b> can be called at any IRQL.
