# KBUGCHECK_CALLBACK_ROUTINE function
The <i>BugCheckCallback</i> routine is executed whenever the system issues a bug check.

## Syntax

```
KBUGCHECK_CALLBACK_ROUTINE KbugcheckCallbackRoutine;

_IRQL_requires_same_ VOID KbugcheckCallbackRoutine(
  IN PVOID Buffer,
  IN ULONG Length
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Buffer`

A pointer to the buffer that was specified when the callback was registered.

`Length`

Specifies the length, in bytes, of the buffer that is pointed to by the <i>Buffer</i> parameter.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

Drivers can supply a <i>BugCheckCallback</i> that resets the device to a known state if the system issues a bug check.

Use <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-keregisterbugcheckcallback.md">KeRegisterBugCheckCallback</a> to register a <i>BugCheckCallback</i> routine. A driver can subsequently remove the callback by using the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-kederegisterbugcheckcallback.md">KeDeregisterBugCheckCallback</a> routine. If the driver can be unloaded, it must remove any registered callbacks in its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564886">Unload</a> routine.

A <i>BugCheckCallback</i> routine is strongly restricted in the actions it can take. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566401">Writing a Bug Check Callback Routine</a>. The routine <u>can</u> safely use the <b>READ_PORT_<i>XXX</i></b>, <b>READ_REGISTER_<i>XXX</i></b>, <b>WRITE_PORT_<i>XXX</i></b>, and <b>WRITE_REGISTER_<i>XXX</i></b> routines to interact with the device.

Drivers that require more sophisticated interaction with the system as it issues a bug check can instead implement <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540677">BugCheckDumpIoCallback</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540679">BugCheckSecondaryDumpDataCallback</a> routines.

Note that beginning with the Windows XP SP1 and Windows Server 2003 operating systems, <i>BugCheckCallback</i> routines execute after the system crash dump file has already been written. (On earlier versions of Windows, the routines execute <u>before</u> the crash dump file is written.) Thus, any data that is stored in the buffer specified by the <i>Buffer</i> parameter will not appear in the crash dump file. Drivers that are required to write data to the crash dump file instead implement a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540679">BugCheckSecondaryDumpDataCallback</a> routine. (On earlier versions of Windows, the data written to <i>Buffer</i> does appear in the crash dump file.)
