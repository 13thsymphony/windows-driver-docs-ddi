# ClfsReadPreviousRestartArea function
The <b>ClfsReadPreviousRestartArea</b> routine reads the previous restart record relative to the current record in a read context.

## Syntax

```
CLFSUSER_API NTSTATUS ClfsReadPreviousRestartArea(
  PVOID     pvReadContext,
  PVOID     *ppvRestartBuffer,
  PULONG    pcbRestartBuffer,
  PCLFS_LSN plsnRestart
);
```

## Parameters

`pvReadContext`

A pointer to a read context obtained by a previous call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541709">ClfsReadRestartArea</a>.

`ppvRestartBuffer`

A pointer to a variable that receives a pointer to the data buffer of the restart record that is read.

`pcbRestartBuffer`

A pointer to a ULONG-typed variable that receives the size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by *<i>ppvRestartBuffer</i>. This is the length of the data buffer of the restart record that is read.

`plsnRestart`

A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541824">CLFS_LSN</a> structure that receives the previous LSN of the restart record that was read.


## Return Value

<b>ClfsReadPreviousRestartArea</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if it succeeds; otherwise, it returns one of the error codes defined in Ntstatus.h. If there are no previous restart areas, the return value is STATUS_LOG_START_OF_LOG.

## Remarks

For an explanation of CLFS concepts and terminology, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a9685648-b08c-48ca-b020-e683068f2ea2">Common Log File System</a>.

For information about reading records from CLFS streams, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560785">Reading Data Records from a CLFS Stream</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560786">Reading Restart Records from a CLFS Stream</a>.

Read contexts are not thread-safe. Clients are responsible for serializing access to read contexts.

Clients append restart records to a CLFS log by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541770">ClfsWriteRestartArea</a>.       

With the <b>ReadPreviousLogRestartArea</b> routine, clients can implement a form of fuzzy checkpointing. For example, the checkpoint state could consist of the log records delimited by two or more restart records.
