# _WORK_QUEUE_TYPE enumeration



## -description
The <b>WORK_QUEUE_TYPE</b> enumeration type indicates the type of system worker thread that handles a work item.



## -syntax

````
typedef enum _WORK_QUEUE_TYPE { 
  CriticalWorkQueue,
  DelayedWorkQueue,
  HyperCriticalWorkQueue,
  NormalWorkQueue,
  BackgroundWorkQueue,
  RealTimeWorkQueue,
  SuperCriticalWorkQueue,
  MaximumWorkQueue,
  CustomPriorityWorkQueue  = 32
} WORK_QUEUE_TYPE;
````


## -enum-fields

### -field CriticalWorkQueue

Indicates a real-time system worker thread. The assigned priority level is 13.


### -field DelayedWorkQueue

Indicates an ordinary worker thread. The assigned priority level is 12.


### -field HyperCriticalWorkQueue

System  priority level. The assigned priority level is 15.


### -field NormalWorkQueue

System priority level. The assigned priority level is 8


### -field BackgroundWorkQueue

System priority level. The assigned priority level is 7.


### -field RealTimeWorkQueue

System  priority level. The assigned priority level is18.


### -field SuperCriticalWorkQueue

System  priority level. The assigned priority level is 14.


### -field MaximumWorkQueue

System  priority maximum. No priority level assigned.


### -field CustomPriorityWorkQueue

The queue has a custom priority level assigned by the caller. The <b>CustomPriorityWorkQueue</b> value is the base priority level for the custom priority queue. Work items are queued at a particular priority by setting <i>QueueType</i> to <b>CustomPriorityWorkQueue</b> + <i>Priority</i> where <i>Priority</i> is the <b>KPRIORITY</b> value for the work item.

This queue type is valid starting with Windows 8.1.


## -remarks
For drivers targeting Windows 8.1 or later versions of Windows, use of only <b>CustomPriorityWorkQueue</b> with a custom priority level is recommended.

 A work queue priority &lt; 17 is advised since queuing  
    at a higher priority may interfere with work item processing by critical system components.
