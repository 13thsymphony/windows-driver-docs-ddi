# _WORK_QUEUE_TYPE Enumeration
The <b>WORK_QUEUE_TYPE</b> enumeration type indicates the type of system worker thread that handles a work item.

## Syntax
````
typedef enum _WORK_QUEUE_TYPE { 
  CriticalWorkQueue,
  DelayedWorkQueue,
  HyperCriticalWorkQueue,
  NormalWorkQueue,
  BackgroundWorkQueue,
  RealTimeWorkQueue,
  SuperCriticalWorkQueue,
  MaximumWorkQueue,
  CustomPriorityWorkQueue  = 32
} WORK_QUEUE_TYPE;
````

## Constants

<table>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>BackgroundWorkQueue</td>
                    <td>System priority level. The assigned priority level is 7.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>CriticalWorkQueue</td>
                    <td>Indicates a real-time system worker thread. The assigned priority level is 13.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>CustomPriorityWorkQueue</td>
                    <td>The queue has a custom priority level assigned by the caller. The <b>CustomPriorityWorkQueue</b> value is the base priority level for the custom priority queue. Work items are queued at a particular priority by setting <i>QueueType</i> to <b>CustomPriorityWorkQueue</b> + <i>Priority</i> where <i>Priority</i> is the <b>KPRIORITY</b> value for the work item.

This queue type is valid starting with Windows 8.1.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>DelayedWorkQueue</td>
                    <td>Indicates an ordinary worker thread. The assigned priority level is 12.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>HyperCriticalWorkQueue</td>
                    <td>System  priority level. The assigned priority level is 15.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>MaximumWorkQueue</td>
                    <td>System  priority maximum. No priority level assigned.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>NormalWorkQueue</td>
                    <td>System priority level. The assigned priority level is 8</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>RealTimeWorkQueue</td>
                    <td>System  priority level. The assigned priority level is18.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>SuperCriticalWorkQueue</td>
                    <td>System  priority level. The assigned priority level is 14.</td>
                </tr>
</table>

    ## Remarks

        For drivers targeting Windows 8.1 or later versions of Windows, use of only <b>CustomPriorityWorkQueue</b> with a custom priority level is recommended.

 A work queue priority &lt; 17 is advised since queuing  
    at a higher priority may interfere with work item processing by critical system components.
