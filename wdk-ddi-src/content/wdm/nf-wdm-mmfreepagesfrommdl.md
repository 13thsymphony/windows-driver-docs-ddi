# MmFreePagesFromMdl function



## -description
The <b>MmFreePagesFromMdl</b> routine frees all the physical pages that are described by an MDL that was created by the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-mmallocatepagesformdl.md">MmAllocatePagesForMdl</a> routine. 



## -syntax

````
VOID MmFreePagesFromMdl(
  _In_ PMDLX MemoryDescriptorList
);
````


## -parameters

### -param MemoryDescriptorList [in]

Pointer to an MDL that was created by <b>MmAllocatePagesForMdl</b>.


## -returns
None


## -remarks
<b>MmFreePagesFromMdl</b> can only be used to free the memory pages that are described by an MDL that was created by <b>MmAllocatePagesForMdl</b>.

After calling <b>MmFreePagesFromMdl</b>, the caller must also call <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exfreepool.md">ExFreePool</a> to release the memory that was allocated for the MDL structure.

<b>MmFreePagesFromMdl</b> runs at IRQL &lt;= APC_LEVEL. For Windows Server 2008 and later versions of the Windows operating system, you can also call this routine at DISPATCH_LEVEL. However, you can improve driver performance by calling at IRQL &lt;= APC_LEVEL.
