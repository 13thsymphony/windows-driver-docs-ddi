# MmFreePagesFromMdl function
The <b>MmFreePagesFromMdl</b> routine frees all the physical pages that are described by an MDL that was created by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554482">MmAllocatePagesForMdl</a> routine.

## Syntax

```

  PMDL MemoryDescriptorList
);
```

## Parameters

## Remarks

<b>MmFreePagesFromMdl</b> can only be used to free the memory pages that are described by an MDL that was created by <b>MmAllocatePagesForMdl</b>.

After calling <b>MmFreePagesFromMdl</b>, the caller must also call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544590">ExFreePool</a> to release the memory that was allocated for the MDL structure.

<b>MmFreePagesFromMdl</b> runs at IRQL &lt;= APC_LEVEL. For Windows Server 2008 and later versions of the Windows operating system, you can also call this routine at DISPATCH_LEVEL. However, you can improve driver performance by calling at IRQL &lt;= APC_LEVEL.
