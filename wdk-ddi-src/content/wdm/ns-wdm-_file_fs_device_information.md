# _FILE_FS_DEVICE_INFORMATION structure
The <b>FILE_FS_DEVICE_INFORMATION</b> structure provides file system device information about the type of device object associated with a file object.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _FILE_FS_DEVICE_INFORMATION {
  DEVICE_TYPE DeviceType;
  ULONG       Characteristics;
} FILE_FS_DEVICE_INFORMATION, *PFILE_FS_DEVICE_INFORMATION;
````

## Members


`Characteristics`

The device characteristics. For a description of relevant values, see <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_device_object.md">DEVICE_OBJECT</a>.

`DeviceType`

Set when a driver calls <b>IoCreateDevice</b> as appropriate for the type of underlying device. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563821">Specifying Device Types</a>.
