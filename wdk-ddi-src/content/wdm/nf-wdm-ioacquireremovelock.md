# IoAcquireRemoveLock function
The <b>IoAcquireRemoveLock</b> routine increments the count for a remove lock, 
   indicating that the associated device object should not be detached from the device stack or deleted.

## Syntax

```
void IoAcquireRemoveLock(
   RemoveLock,
   Tag
);
```

## Parameters

`RemoveLock`

Pointer to an <b>IO_REMOVE_LOCK</b> structure that the caller initialized with a 
      previous call to 
      <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549324">IoInitializeRemoveLock</a>.

`Tag`

Optionally points to a caller-supplied tag that identifies this instance of acquiring the remove lock. For 
       example, a driver Dispatch routine typically sets this parameter to a pointer to the IRP the routine is 
       processing.

If a driver specifies a <i>Tag</i> on a call to 
       <b>IoAcquireRemoveLock</b>, the driver must supply the same 
       <i>Tag</i> in the corresponding call to 
       <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549560">IoReleaseRemoveLock</a>.

The <i>Tag</i> does not have to be unique, but should be something meaningful during 
       debugging.

The I/O system uses this parameter on checked builds only.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

A driver must initialize a remove lock with a call to 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549324">IoInitializeRemoveLock</a> before using the 
     lock.

A driver must call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549560">IoReleaseRemoveLock</a> to 
     release the lock when it is no longer needed.
