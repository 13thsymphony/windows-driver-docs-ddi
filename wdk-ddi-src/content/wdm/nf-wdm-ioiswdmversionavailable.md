# IoIsWdmVersionAvailable function
The <b>IoIsWdmVersionAvailable</b> routine checks whether a given WDM version is supported by the operating system.

## Syntax

````
BOOLEAN IoIsWdmVersionAvailable(
  _In_ UCHAR MajorVersion,
  _In_ UCHAR MinorVersion
);
````

## Parameters

`MajorVersion`

Specifies the major version number of WDM that is requested.

`MinorVersion`

Specifies the minor version number of WDM that is requested.


## Return Value

<b>IoIsWdmVersionAvailable</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the version of WDM that the operating system provides is greater than or equal to the version number of WDM being requested. Otherwise, it returns <b>FALSE</b>.

## Remarks

Drivers should use the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-rtlisntddiversionavailable.md">RtlIsNtDdiVersionAvailable</a> routine instead of the <b>IoIsWdmVersionAvailable</b> routine.

Cross-platform drivers should use this routine to check the WDM version before performing any operations that vary by platform or are not supported in all versions of WDM.

The WDM_MAJORVERSION and WDM_MINORVERSION constants, which are defined in the Wdm.h header file, specify the WDM major and minor version numbers for the current version of Windows. The following lists the WDM version provided with each operating system.

Windows 7

6

0x00

Windows Server 2008 R2

Windows Server 2008

Windows Vista

Windows Server 2003

1

0x30

Windows XP

0x20

Windows 2000

0x10

Windows Me

0x05

Windows 98

Note that the minor version number is defined as a hexadecimal value.

Later versions of WDM support all the features available in earlier versions of WDM; that is, each version of WDM is a superset of the previous WDM version.

The following call returns <b>TRUE</b> on any of the listed operating systems, because all these systems support all the features of WDM 1.0:

The following example shows how a driver can dynamically detect the current operating system:

As the example shows, calling <b>IoIsWdmVersionAvailable</b>(1, 5) returns <b>TRUE</b> on Windows Me, Windows 2000, and any succeeding operating systems, but <b>FALSE</b> on Windows 98 and Windows 98 SE.
