# InterlockedCompareExchangePointer function



## -description
The <b>InterlockedCompareExchangePointer</b> routine performs an atomic operation that compares the input pointer value pointed to by <i>Destination</i> with the pointer value <i>Comparand</i>.


## -syntax

````
PVOID InterlockedCompareExchangePointer(
  _Inout_ PVOID *Destination ,
  _In_    PVOID Exchange ,
  _In_    PVOID Comparand
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Destination  [in, out]

A pointer to a PVOID value. If (*<i>Destination</i>) = <i>Comparand</i>, then the routine sets (*<i>Destination</i>) to <i>Exchange</i>.

### -param Exchange  [in]

Specifies the PVOID value to set (*<i>Destination</i>) to.

### -param Comparand [in]

Specifies the PVOID value to compare with (*<i>Destination</i>).

## -returns
<b>InterlockedCompareExchangePointer</b> returns the original value of the pointer at *<i>Destination</i> (that is, the value of this pointer at entry to the routine).

## -remarks
If <i>Comparand</i> is equal to *<i>Destination</i>, then *<i>Destination</i> is set to equal <i>Exchange</i>. Otherwise, *<i>Destination</i> is unchanged.

<b>InterlockedCompareExchangePointer</b> provides a fast, atomic way to synchronize the testing and updating of a pointer variable that is shared by multiple threads. If the input value pointed to by <i>Destination</i> equals the value of <i>Comparand</i>, the value pointed to by <i>Destination</i> is set to the value of <i>Exchange</i>.

<b>InterlockedCompareExchangePointer</b> is designed for speed and, typically, is implemented inline by a compiler. <b>InterlockedCompareExchangePointer</b> is atomic only with respect to other <b>Interlocked<i>Xxx</i></b> calls. It does not use a spin lock and can be safely used on pageable data.

The <b>InterlockedCompareExchangePointer</b> routine is atomic only with respect to other <b>Interlocked<i>Xxx</i></b> calls.

Interlocked operations cannot be used on non-cached memory.
