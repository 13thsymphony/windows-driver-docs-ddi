## -parameters

### -param DmaAdapter [in]

A pointer to a <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_dma_adapter.md">DMA_ADAPTER</a> structure. This structure is the adapter object that represents the driver's bus-master DMA device or system DMA channel. The caller obtained this pointer from a previous call to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549220">IoGetDmaAdapter</a> routine.


### -param DeviceObject [in]

A pointer to a <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_device_object.md">DEVICE_OBJECT</a> structure. This structure is the physical device object (PDO) that represents the target device for the requested DMA operation.


### -param DmaTransferContext [in]

A pointer to an initialized DMA transfer context. This context was initialized by a previous call to the <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pinitialize_dma_transfer_context.md">InitializeDmaTransferContext</a> routine. This context must be unique across all adapter allocation requests. To cancel a pending allocation request, the caller must supply the DMA transfer context for the request to the <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pcancel_adapter_channel.md">CancelAdapterChannel</a> routine.


### -param Mdl [in]

A pointer to an MDL chain that describes the physical page layout for a collection of locked-down buffers in virtual memory. The scatter/gather list for the DMA transfer will use the region of this memory that is specified by the <i>Offset</i> and <i>Length</i> parameters. For more information about MDL chains, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565421">Using MDLs</a>.


### -param Offset [in]

The starting offset for the scatter/gather DMA transfer. This parameter is a byte offset from the start of the buffer in the first MDL in the MDL chain. If the MDLs in the MDL chain specify a total of N bytes of buffer space, valid values of <i>Offset</i> are in the range 0 to N–1.


### -param Length [in]

The size, in bytes, of the DMA transfer. If the MDL chain specifies a total of N bytes of buffer space, valid values of <i>Length</i> are in the range 1 to N–<i>Offset</i>.


### -param Flags [in]

The adapter channel allocation flags. The following flag is supported.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>

### -param DMA_SYNCHRONOUS_CALLBACK

</td>
<td width="60%">
The <b>BuildScatterGatherListEx</b> routine is called synchronously. If this flag is set, and the required DMA resources are not immediately available, the call fails and returns STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

If the <b>DMA_SYNCHRONOUS_CALLBACK</b> flag is set, the <i>ExecutionRoutine</i> parameter is optional and can be <b>NULL</b>. If this flag is not set, <i>ExecutionRoutine</i> must be a valid, non-<b>NULL</b> pointer. For more information about this flag, see the Remarks section.


### -param ExecutionRoutine [in, optional]

A pointer to the driver-supplied <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-driver_list_control.md">AdapterListControl</a> routine that initiates the DMA transfer for the driver. The I/O manager calls the <i>AdapterListControl</i> routine after the required resources are allocated for the adapter object. After the <i>AdapterListControl</i> routine returns, the I/O manager automatically frees the adapter object and the resources that were allocated for this object.

If the <b>DMA_SYNCHRONOUS_CALLBACK</b> flag is set, <i>ExecutionRoutine</i> is optional and can be <b>NULL</b>.  If <i>ExecutionRoutine</i> is <b>NULL</b>, the caller can use the resources allocated by <b>BuildScatterGatherListEx</b>. For more information, see the Remarks section.


### -param Context [in, optional]

The driver-determined, adapter-control context. This context is passed to the <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-driver_list_control.md">AdapterListControl</a> routine as the <i>Context</i> parameter.


### -param WriteToDevice [in]

The direction of the DMA transfer. Set this parameter to <b>TRUE</b> for a write operation, which transfers data from memory to the device. Set this parameter to <b>FALSE</b> for a read operation, which transfers data from the device to memory.


### -param ScatterGatherBuffer [in]

A pointer to a caller-allocated buffer into which the routine writes the scatter/gather list for the DMA transfer. This list begins with a <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_scatter_gather_list.md">SCATTER_GATHER_LIST</a> structure, which is followed by a <b>SCATTER_GATHER_ELEMENT</b> array.


### -param ScatterGatherBufferLength [in]

The size, in bytes, of the buffer passed in the <i>ScatterGatherBuffer</i> parameter. The allocated buffer size must be large enough to contain the scatter/gather list, plus internal data that the operating system stores in this buffer. To calculate the required buffer size, call the <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pget_dma_transfer_info.md">GetDmaTransferInfo</a> or <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pcalculate_scatter_gather_list_size.md">CalculateScatterGatherList</a> routine.


### -param DmaCompletionRoutine [in, optional]

Not used. Set to <b>NULL</b>.


### -param CompletionContext [in, optional]

Not used. Set to <b>NULL</b>.


### -param ScatterGatherList [out, optional]

A pointer to a variable into which the routine writes a pointer to the scatter/gather list for the DMA transfer. This list begins with a <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_scatter_gather_list.md">SCATTER_GATHER_LIST</a> structure, which contains a pointer to a <b>SCATTER_GATHER_ELEMENT</b> array. This output pointer always matches the <i>ScatterGatherBuffer</i> parameter value.

If the <b>DMA_SYNCHRONOUS_CALLBACK</b> flag is set and the <i>ExecutionRoutine</i> parameter is <b>NULL</b>, <i>ScatterGatherList</i> must be a valid, non-<b>NULL</b> pointer. If <i>ExecutionRoutine</i> is non-<b>NULL</b>, <i>ScatterGatherList</i> is optional and can be <b>NULL</b> if the calling driver does not require the scatter/gather list. The <b>BuildScatterGatherListEx</b> call fails if the <b>DMA_SYNCHRONOUS_CALLBACK</b> flag is set and <i>ScatterGatherList</i> and <i>ExecutionRoutine</i> are both <b>NULL</b>, or if the <b>DMA_SYNCHRONOUS_CALLBACK</b> flag is not set and <i>ExecutionRoutine</i> is <b>NULL</b>.


## -returns
<b>BuildScatterGatherListEx</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call is successful. Possible error return values include the following status codes.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETERS</b></dt>
</dl>The routine failed due to invalid parameter values passed by the caller.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL</b></dt>
</dl>The caller-supplied buffer in <i>ScatterGatherBuffer</i> is too small to contain the scatter/gather list.
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES</b></dt>
</dl>The routine failed to allocate resources required for the DMA transfer.

 


## -remarks
<b>BuildScatterGatherListEx</b><i> is not a system routine that can be called directly by name. This routine can be called only by pointer from the address returned in a </i><a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_dma_operations.md">DMA_OPERATIONS</a><i> structure. </i>Drivers obtain the address of this routine by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549220">IoGetDmaAdapter</a> with the <b>Version</b> member of the <i>DeviceDescription</i> parameter set to DEVICE_DESCRIPTION_VERSION3. If <b>IoGetDmaAdapter</b> returns <b>NULL</b>, the routine is not available on your platform.

Use <b>BuildScatterGatherListEx</b> only for bus-master adapters. Do not use this routine for a system DMA adapter.

<b>BuildScatterGatherListEx</b> is similar to the <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pget_scatter_gather_list_ex.md">GetScatterGatherListEx</a> routine, except that it requires the caller to allocate the buffer for the scatter/gather list.

For example, a driver might preallocate one or more scatter/gather buffers during device initialization. Later, a <b>BuildScatterGatherListEx</b> call that uses such a buffer can succeed in conditions of low memory availability that might cause a <b>GetScatterGatherListEx</b> call to fail.

By default, <b>BuildScatterGatherListEx</b> returns asynchronously, without waiting for the requested resource allocation to complete. After this return, the caller can, if necessary, cancel the pending allocation request by calling the <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pcancel_adapter_channel.md">CancelAdapterChannel</a> routine.

If the calling driver sets the <b>DMA_SYNCHRONOUS_CALLBACK</b> flag, the <b>BuildScatterGatherListEx</b> routine behaves as follows:

If the requested resources are not immediately available, <b>BuildScatterGatherListEx</b> does not wait for resources, does not build a scatter/gather list, and does not call the <i>AdapterListControl</i> routine. Instead,  <b>BuildScatterGatherListEx</b> fails and returns STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES.

The driver is not required to supply an <i>AdapterListControl</i> routine if the <b>DMA_SYNCHRONOUS_CALLBACK</b> flag is set.

If the driver supplies an <i>AdapterListControl</i> routine, the <b>DMA_SYNCHRONOUS_CALLBACK</b> flag indicates that this routine is to be called in the context of the calling thread, before <b>BuildScatterGatherListEx</b> returns.

If the driver does not supply an <i>AdapterListControl</i> routine, the driver can use the allocated resources and scatter/gather list after <b>BuildScatterGatherListEx</b> returns. In this case, the driver must supply a valid, non-<b>NULL</b> <i>ScatterGatherList</i> pointer. In addition, after the driver-initiated DMA transfer completes, the driver must call the <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pfree_adapter_object.md">FreeAdapterObject</a> routine to free the resources that <b>BuildScatterGatherListEx</b> allocated for the adapter object.

<b>BuildScatterGatherListEx</b> is an extended version of the <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pbuild_scatter_gather_list.md">BuildScatterGatherList</a> routine. The following list summarizes the features that are available only in the extended version:



The calling driver can specify a starting offset for a scatter/gather DMA transfer instead of starting the transfer at the first buffer address at the start of the MDL chain.

The driver can call <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pcancel_adapter_channel.md">CancelAdapterChannel</a> to cancel a pending allocation request when the DMA adapter is queued to wait for DMA resources.

The driver can set the <b>DMA_SYNCHRONOUS_CALLBACK</b> flag to request that the driver-supplied <i>AdapterListControl</i> routine be called in the calling thread, before <b>BuildScatterGatherListEx</b> returns.
