# _MM_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS_LIST structure
The <b>MM_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS_LIST</b> structure specifies a range of physical addresses.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct _MM_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS_LIST {
  PHYSICAL_ADDRESS PhysicalAddress;
  SIZE_T           NumberOfBytes;
} MM_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS_LIST, *PMM_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS_LIST;
```

## Members


`PhysicalAddress`

The starting physical address of the range. This address must be aligned to a page boundary in physical memory.

`NumberOfBytes`

The number of bytes in the range. This member must be nonzero and an integer multiple of the memory page size.

## Remarks
The first parameter to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj206443">MmAllocateMdlForIoSpace</a> routine is a pointer to an array of <b>MM_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS_LIST</b> structures.
