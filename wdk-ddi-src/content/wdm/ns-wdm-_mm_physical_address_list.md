## -description
The <b>MM_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS_LIST</b> structure specifies a range of physical addresses.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _MM_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS_LIST {
  PHYSICAL_ADDRESS PhysicalAddress;
  SIZE_T           NumberOfBytes;
} MM_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS_LIST, *PMM_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS_LIST;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field PhysicalAddress

The starting physical address of the range. This address must be aligned to a page boundary in physical memory.


### -field NumberOfBytes

The number of bytes in the range. This member must be nonzero and an integer multiple of the memory page size.


## -remarks
The first parameter to the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-mmallocatemdlforiospace.md">MmAllocateMdlForIoSpace</a> routine is a pointer to an array of <b>MM_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS_LIST</b> structures.
