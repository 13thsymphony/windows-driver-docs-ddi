# ClfsWriteRestartArea function
The <b>ClfsWriteRestartArea</b> routine atomically appends a new restart record to a CLFS stream, flushes the restart record to stable storage, and optionally updates the base LSN of the stream.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS ClfsWriteRestartArea(
  _Inout_   PVOID     pvMarshalContext,
  _In_      PVOID     pvRestartBuffer,
  _In_      ULONG     cbRestartBuffer,
  _In_opt_  PCLFS_LSN plsnBase,
  _In_      ULONG     fFlags,
  _Out_opt_ PULONG    pcbWritten,
  _Out_opt_ PCLFS_LSN plsnNext
);
````

## Parameters

`pvMarshalContext`

A pointer to an opaque context that represents a marshalling area associated with a CLFS stream. The caller previously obtained this pointer by calling <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-clfscreatemarshallingarea.md">ClfsCreateMarshallingArea</a>.

`pvRestartBuffer`

A pointer to a buffer that contains the data for the restart record.

`cbRestartBuffer`

The size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by <i>pvRestartBuffer</i>. This is the size of the restart data.

`plsnBase`

A pointer to a <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_cls_lsn.md">CLFS_LSN</a> structure that specifies a new base LSN for the stream. If this parameter is <b>NULL</b>, the base LSN is not changed.

`fFlags`

This parameter must be one of the following values.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
0

</td>
<td>
The restart record is placed in newly allocated space in an I/O block. The number of reserved records in the marshalling area is not changed.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
CLFS_FLAG_USE_RESERVATION

</td>
<td>
The restart record is placed in previously reserved space in an I/O block. The number of reserved records in the marshalling area is reduced by one.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

`pcbWritten`

A pointer to a ULONG-typed variable that receives the number of bytes actually forced to stable storage. This parameter can be <b>NULL</b>.

`plsnNext`

A pointer to a <b>CLFS_LSN</b> structure that receives the LSN of the newly written restart record.


## Return Value

<b>ClfsWriteRestartArea</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if it succeeds; otherwise, it returns one of the error codes defined in Ntstatus.h.

## Remarks

Typically ClfsWriteRestartArea is called as the last act of a client checkpoint.

ClfsWriteRestartArea is a relatively expensive operation because it causes a flush of all records currently in the marshalling area along with a flush of stream and log metadata.

At any one time, only one marshalling area should be used to write data to a stream. Having two marshalling areas writing into the stream might result in stream corruption.

If you just want to set the base LSN of a stream, use <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-clfsadvancelogbase.md">ClfsAdvanceLogBase</a>, which does not necessarily flush any data to stable storage.
