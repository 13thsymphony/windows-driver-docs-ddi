# KSTART_ROUTINE callback



## -description
The <i>ThreadStart</i> routine provides an entry point for a driver-created system thread.



## -prototype

````
KSTART_ROUTINE ThreadStart;

VOID ThreadStart(
  _In_ PVOID StartContext
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param StartContext [in]

A caller-supplied pointer to driver-defined context information that is specified in the <i>StartContext</i> parameter a previous call to <a href="kernel.pscreatesystemthread">PsCreateSystemThread</a>.


## -returns
None

To define a <i>ThreadStart</i> callback routine, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of callback routine you're defining. Windows provides a set of callback function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the callback function types helps <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/2F3549EF-B50F-455A-BDC7-1F67782B8DCA">Code Analysis for Drivers</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/74feeb16-387c-4796-987a-aff3fb79b556">Static Driver Verifier</a> (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it's a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

For example, to define a <i>ThreadStart</i> callback routine that is named <code>MyThreadStart</code>, use the KSTART_ROUTINE type as shown in this code example:

Then, implement your callback routine as follows:

The KSTART_ROUTINE function type is defined in the Wdm.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation to your function definition. The _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the KSTART_ROUTINE function type in the header file are used. For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/3260b53e-82be-4dbc-8ac5-d0e52de77f9d">Declaring Functions by Using Function Role Types for WDM Drivers</a>. For information about _Use_decl_annotations_, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=286697">Annotating Function Behavior</a>.
