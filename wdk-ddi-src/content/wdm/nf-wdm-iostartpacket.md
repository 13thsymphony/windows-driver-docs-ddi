# IoStartPacket function
The <b>IoStartPacket</b> routine calls the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563858">StartIo</a> routine with the given IRP or inserts the IRP into the device queue associated with the given device object if the device is already busy.

## Syntax

```
NTKERNELAPI VOID IoStartPacket(
  PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject,
  PIRP           Irp,
  PULONG         Key,
  PDRIVER_CANCEL CancelFunction
);
```

## Parameters

`DeviceObject`

Pointer to the target device object for the IRP.

`Irp`

Pointer to the IRP to be processed.

`Key`

Pointer to a value that determines where to insert the packet into the device queue. If this is zero, the packet is inserted at the tail of the device queue.

`CancelFunction`

Specifies the entry point for a driver-supplied <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh406716">Cancel</a> routine.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

If the driver is already busy processing a request for the target device object, then the packet is queued in the device queue. Otherwise, this routine calls the driver's <i>StartIo</i> routine with the specified IRP.

If a non-NULL <i>CancelFunction</i> pointer is supplied, it is set in the IRP so the driver's <i>Cancel</i> routine is called if the IRP is canceled before its completion.

Drivers that do not have a <i>StartIo</i> routine cannot call <b>IoStartPacket</b>.

Callers of <b>IoStartPacket</b> must be running at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL. Usually, this routine is called from a device driver's Dispatch routine at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL.
