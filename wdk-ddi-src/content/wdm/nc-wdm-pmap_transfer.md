# PMAP_TRANSFER callback function
The <b>MapTransfer</b> routine sets up map registers for an adapter object to map a DMA transfer from a locked-down buffer.

## Syntax

```
PMAP_TRANSFER PmapTransfer;

PHYSICAL_ADDRESS PmapTransfer(
  PDMA_ADAPTER DmaAdapter,
  PMDL Mdl,
  PVOID MapRegisterBase,
  PVOID CurrentVa,
  PULONG Length,
  BOOLEAN WriteToDevice
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`DmaAdapter`

Pointer to the DMA adapter object returned by <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iogetdmaadapter.md">IoGetDmaAdapter</a> and previously passed to <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pallocate_adapter_channel.md">AllocateAdapterChannel</a> for the current IRP's transfer request.

`Mdl`

Pointer to one of the following: the MDL that describes the buffer at <b>MdlAddress</b> in the current IRP or the MDL that describes the common buffer set up by the driver of a subordinate device (auto-initialize mode).

`MapRegisterBase`

Specifies the map registers allocated for the DMA operation.  The system passes this value  to the driver's <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-driver_control.md">AdapterControl</a> routine.

`CurrentVa`

Pointer to the current virtual address of the data to be transferred for a DMA transfer operation.

`Length`

Specifies the length, in bytes, to be mapped. If the driver indicated that its device was a bus master with scatter/gather support when it called <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iogetdmaadapter.md">IoGetDmaAdapter</a>, the value of <i>Length</i> on return from <b>MapTransfer</b> indicates how many bytes were mapped. Otherwise, the input and output values of <i>Length</i> are identical.

`WriteToDevice`

Indicates the direction of the transfer operation: <b>TRUE</b> for a transfer from the locked-down buffer to the device.


## Return Value

<b>MapTransfer</b> returns the logical address of the region mapped, which the driver of a bus-master adapter can use. Drivers of devices that use a system DMA controller cannot use this value and should ignore it.

## Remarks

<b>MapTransfer</b><u> is not a system routine that can be called directly by name. This routine is callable only by pointer from the address returned in a 
          </u><a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_dma_operations.md">DMA_OPERATIONS</a><u> structure</u>. Drivers obtain the address of this routine by calling <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iogetdmaadapter.md">IoGetDmaAdapter</a>. 

The <i>DmaAdapter</i> must have already been allocated as a result of the driver's preceding call to <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pallocate_adapter_channel.md">AllocateAdapterChannel</a>.

The number of map registers that can be set up cannot exceed the maximum returned when the driver called <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iogetdmaadapter.md">IoGetDmaAdapter</a>.

A driver can get the initial <i>CurrentVa</i> for the start of a packet-based DMA transfer by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554539">MmGetMdlVirtualAddress</a>. However, the value returned is an index into the <i>Mdl</i>, rather than a valid virtual address. If the driver must split a large transfer request into more than one DMA operation, it must update <i>CurrentVa</i> and <i>Length</i> for each DMA operation.

The driver of a bus-master device with scatter/gather support can use the returned logical address and updated <i>Length</i> value to build a scatter/gather list, calling <b>MapTransfer</b> repeatedly until it has used all available map registers for the transfer operation. However, such a driver could more simply use the <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pget_scatter_gather_list.md">GetScatterGatherList</a> routine.
