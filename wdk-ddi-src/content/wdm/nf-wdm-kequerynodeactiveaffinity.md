# KeQueryNodeActiveAffinity function
The <b>KeQueryNodeActiveAffinity</b> routine gets the current processor affinity of a specified node in a multiprocessor system that has a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture.

## Syntax

````
VOID KeQueryNodeActiveAffinity(
  _In_      USHORT          NodeNumber,
  _Out_opt_ PGROUP_AFFINITY Affinity,
  _Out_opt_ PUSHORT         Count
);
````

## Parameters

`NodeNumber`

The node number. If a multiprocessor system contains <i>n</i> nodes, the nodes are numbered from 0 to <i>n</i>-1. To obtain the highest node number (<i>n</i>-1) in the system, call the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-kequeryhighestnodenumber.md">KeQueryHighestNodeNumber</a> routine.

`Affinity`

A pointer to a caller-allocated buffer into which the routine writes a <a href="..\minitape\ns-minitape-_group_affinity.md">GROUP_AFFINITY</a> structure. This structure contains the group number of the group that contains the node that is identified by <i>NodeNumber</i>, and an affinity mask that indicates which logical processors in the node are active. You can set this parameter to <b>NULL</b> if you do not need this information.

`Count`

A pointer to a location into which the routine writes the number of active processors that are represented in the node affinity mask that is pointed to by <i>Affinity</i>. You can set this parameter to <b>NULL</b> if you do not need this information.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

The caller-allocated buffer that is pointed to by the <i>Affinity</i> parameter must be large enough to contain a <b>GROUP_AFFINITY</b> structure. The <b>Mask</b> member of this structure contains an affinity mask that indicates which processors are active. If a processor is active, the corresponding bit in the mask is one. All other bits are zero.

In a NUMA multiprocessor architecture, a node is a collection of processors that share fast access to a region of memory. Memory access is non-uniform because a processor can access the memory in its node faster than it can access the memory in other nodes.

The number of processors in a node cannot exceed the number of bits in the affinity mask in the structure that is pointed to by <i>Affinity</i>. The affinity mask also determines the maximum number of processors in a group.

If, during system initialization, Windows encounters a NUMA hardware node that contains more logical processors than will fit into a group, Windows splits the node into smaller, logical nodes. Each of these nodes does not exceed the maximum group size. The <i>NodeNumber</i> parameter identifies a logical node. To obtain the maximum number of processors per group, call the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-kequerymaximumprocessorcountex.md">KeQueryMaximumProcessorCountEx</a> routine.
