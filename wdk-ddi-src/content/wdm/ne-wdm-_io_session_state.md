# _IO_SESSION_STATE Enumeration
The <b>IO_SESSION_STATE</b> enumeration contains constants that indicate the current state of a user session.

## Syntax
```
typedef enum _IO_SESSION_STATE {
  IoSessionStateCreated               ,
  IoSessionStateInitialized           ,
  IoSessionStateConnected             ,
  IoSessionStateDisconnected          ,
  IoSessionStateDisconnectedLoggedOn  ,
  IoSessionStateLoggedOn              ,
  IoSessionStateLoggedOff             ,
  IoSessionStateTerminated            ,
  IoSessionStateMax
} IO_SESSION_STATE, *PIO_SESSION_STATE;
```

## Constants

<table>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>IoSessionStateCreated</td>
                    <td>The session has been created.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>IoSessionStateInitialized</td>
                    <td>The session has been initialized but has not yet been created.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>IoSessionStateConnected</td>
                    <td>The session is connected but the user has not yet logged on.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>IoSessionStateDisconnected</td>
                    <td>The session has been disconnected.</td>

                    <td>IoSessionStateDisconnectedLoggedOn</td>
                    <td>The session was disconnected while the user was logged on.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>IoSessionStateLoggedOn</td>
                    <td>The user is logged on to the session.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>IoSessionStateLoggedOff</td>
                    <td>The user has logged off of the session.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>IoSessionStateTerminated</td>
                    <td>The session has been terminated.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>IoSessionStateMax</td>
                    <td>Specifies the maximum value in this enumeration type.</td>
                </tr>
</table>

## Remarks

When a driver calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549164">IoGetContainerInformation</a> routine to obtain information about a user session (<i>InformationClass</i> = <b>IoSessionStateInformation</b>), the I/O manager writes an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550636">IO_SESSION_STATE_INFORMATION</a> structure to the buffer pointed to by the routine's <i>Buffer</i> parameter. The I/O manager sets the <b>SessionState</b> member of this structure to an <b>IO_SESSION_STATE</b> enumeration constant (other than <b>IoSessionStateMax</b>).

The following table shows the session state transitions. For each state transition, the table shows the following:

<ul>
<li>
The <i>from</i> state (a column label in a gray box)

</li>
<li>
The <i>to</i> state (a row label in a gray box)

</li>
<li>
The event that causes the transition (a table entry in a white box)

</li>
</ul>
A blank white box indicates that no transition can occur directly from the associated <i>from</i> state to the corresponding <i>to</i> state.

<img alt="Table listing session state transitions " src="images/sessionstate.png"/>
In the preceding table, the <i>from</i> and <i>to</i> states are represented by <b>IO_SESSION_STATE</b> enumeration constants, and the events are represented by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550623">IO_SESSION_EVENT</a> enumeration constants. For example, if the session state is <b>IoSessionStateConnected</b> (abbreviated as "Connected" in the table), an <b>IoSessionEventLogon</b> event (abbreviated as "Logon") causes a transition to the <b>IoSessionStateLoggedOn</b> state (abbreviated as "LoggedOn"). The starting state for a new session is <b>IoSessionStateInitialized</b> (abbreviated as "Initialized").
