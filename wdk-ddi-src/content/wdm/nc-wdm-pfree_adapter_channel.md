# PFREE_ADAPTER_CHANNEL callback function
The <b>FreeAdapterChannel</b> routine releases the system DMA controller when a driver has completed all DMA operations necessary to satisfy the current IRP.

## Syntax

```
PFREE_ADAPTER_CHANNEL PfreeAdapterChannel;

void PfreeAdapterChannel(
  PDMA_ADAPTER DmaAdapter
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`DmaAdapter`

Pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544062">DMA_ADAPTER</a>  structure returned by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549220">IoGetDmaAdapter</a> that represents the bus-master adapter or DMA controller.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

<b>FreeAdapterChannel</b>
           is not a system routine that can be called directly by name. This routine is callable only by pointer from the address returned in a 
          <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544071">DMA_OPERATIONS</a>
           structure. Drivers obtain the address of this routine by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549220">IoGetDmaAdapter</a>.

After a driver has transferred all the data and called <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545917">FlushAdapterBuffers</a>, it calls <b>FreeAdapterChannel</b> to release the system DMA controller that was previously allocated with a call to <b>AllocateAdapterChannel</b>.

<b>FreeAdapterChannel</b> frees any map registers that were allocated by an earlier call to <b>AllocateAdapterChannel</b>. A driver calls this routine only if its <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540504">AdapterControl</a> routine returns <b>KeepObject</b>.
