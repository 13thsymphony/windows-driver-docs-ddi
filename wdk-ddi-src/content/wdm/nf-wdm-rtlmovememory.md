# RtlMoveMemory macro



## -description
The <b>RtlMoveMemory</b> routine copies the contents of a source memory block to a destination memory block, and supports overlapping source and destination memory blocks.



## -syntax

````
VOID RtlMoveMemory(
  _Out_       VOID UNALIGNED *Destination,
  _In_  const VOID UNALIGNED *Source,
  _In_        SIZE_T         Length
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Destination [out]

A pointer to the destination memory block to copy the bytes to.


### -param Source [in]

A pointer to the source memory block to copy the bytes from.


### -param Length [in]

The number of bytes to copy from the source to the destination.


## -remarks
The source memory block, which is defined by <i>Source</i> and <i>Length</i>, can overlap the destination memory block, which is defined by <i>Destination</i> and <i>Length</i>.

The <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-rtlcopymemory.md">RtlCopyMemory</a> routine runs faster than <b>RtlMoveMemory</b>, but <b>RtlCopyMemory</b> requires that the source and destination memory blocks do not overlap.

Callers of <b>RtlMoveMemory</b> can be running at any IRQL if the source and destination memory blocks are in nonpaged system memory. Otherwise, the caller must be running at IRQL &lt;= APC_LEVEL.
