## -description
The <b>REG_REPLACE_KEY_INFORMATION</b> structure describes the metadata that is about to be replaced for a key.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _REG_REPLACE_KEY_INFORMATION {
  PVOID           Object;
  PUNICODE_STRING OldFileName;
  PUNICODE_STRING NewFileName;
  PVOID           CallContext;
  PVOID           ObjectContext;
  PVOID           Reserved;
} REG_REPLACE_KEY_INFORMATION, *PREG_REPLACE_KEY_INFORMATION;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Object

A pointer to a registry key object for the key whose metadata is about to be replaced.


### -field OldFileName

The name of the file that receives a backup copy of the registry information being replaced.


### -field NewFileName

The name of the file with the registry information. This file is typically created by using the <b>RegSaveKey</b> function.


### -field CallContext

Optional driver-defined context information that the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560903">RegistryCallback</a> routine can supply. This member is defined for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system.


### -field ObjectContext

A pointer to driver-defined context information, which the driver has associated with a registry object by calling <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-cmsetcallbackobjectcontext.md">CmSetCallbackObjectContext</a>. This member is defined for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system.


### -field Reserved

This member is reserved for future use. This member is defined for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system.


## -remarks
The system passes this structure to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560903">RegistryCallback</a> routine every time a thread attempts to replace the metadata for a key.
