# _REG_REPLACE_KEY_INFORMATION structure
The <b>REG_REPLACE_KEY_INFORMATION</b> structure describes the metadata that is about to be replaced for a key.

## Syntax
```
typedef struct _REG_REPLACE_KEY_INFORMATION {
  PVOID           Object;
  PUNICODE_STRING OldFileName;
  PUNICODE_STRING NewFileName;
  PVOID           CallContext;
  PVOID           ObjectContext;
  PVOID           Reserved;
} REG_REPLACE_KEY_INFORMATION, *PREG_REPLACE_KEY_INFORMATION;
```

## Members


`Object`

A pointer to a registry key object for the key whose metadata is about to be replaced.

`OldFileName`

The name of the file that receives a backup copy of the registry information being replaced.

`NewFileName`

The name of the file with the registry information. This file is typically created by using the <b>RegSaveKey</b> function.

`CallContext`

Optional driver-defined context information that the driver's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560903">RegistryCallback</a> routine can supply. This member is defined for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system.

`ObjectContext`

A pointer to driver-defined context information, which the driver has associated with a registry object by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541924">CmSetCallbackObjectContext</a>. This member is defined for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system.

`Reserved`

This member is reserved for future use. This member is defined for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system.

## Remarks
The system passes this structure to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560903">RegistryCallback</a> routine every time a thread attempts to replace the metadata for a key.

For more information about registry filtering operations, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545879">Filtering Registry Calls</a>.
