# _COUNTED_REASON_CONTEXT structure



## -description
The <b>COUNTED_REASON_CONTEXT</b> structure contains one or more strings that give reasons for a power request.


## -syntax

````
typedef struct _COUNTED_REASON_CONTEXT {
  ULONG Version;
  ULONG Flags;
  union {
    struct {
      UNICODE_STRING  ResourceFileName;
      USHORT          ResourceReasonId;
      ULONG           StringCount;
      PUNICODE_STRING ReasonStrings;
    };
    UNICODE_STRING SimpleString;
  };
} COUNTED_REASON_CONTEXT, *PCOUNTED_REASON_CONTEXT;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Version

The version number of the structure. Set this member to DIAGNOSTIC_REASON_VERSION.

### -field Flags

Indicates whether the structure contains a simple reason string or a detailed set of reason strings. Set this member to one of the following constants:
<ul>
<li>
DIAGNOSTIC_REASON_SIMPLE_STRING
</li>
<li>
DIAGNOSTIC_REASON_DETAILED_STRING
</li>
</ul>
If <b>Flags</b> = DIAGNOSTIC_REASON_SIMPLE_STRING, the <b>SimpleString</b> member of the union is valid. If <b>Flags</b> = DIAGNOSTIC_REASON_DETAILED_STRING, the <b>ResourceFileName</b>, <b>ResourceReasonId</b>, <b>StringCount</b>, and <b>ReasonStrings</b> members are valid (and the <b>SimpleString</b> member is not valid).

### -field ResourceFileName

A pointer to a wide-character, null-terminated string that contains the pathname of a resource file. This resource file contains one or more localized strings that give reasons for a power request. This member is optional and can be specified as <b>NULL</b> or as an empty string if no resource file is required. This member is valid only if <b>Flags</b> = DIAGNOSTIC_REASON_DETAILED_STRING. 

### -field ResourceReasonId

The resource ID assigned to the first reason string in the resource file that is specified by <b>ResourceFileName</b>. This member is valid only if <b>Flags</b> = DIAGNOSTIC_REASON_DETAILED_STRING. 

### -field StringCount

The number of reason strings in the <b>ReasonStrings</b> array or in the resource file that is specified by <b>ResourceFileName</b>. This member is valid only if <b>Flags</b> = DIAGNOSTIC_REASON_DETAILED_STRING. 

### -field ReasonStrings

A pointer to an array of string pointers. Each array element is a pointer to a wide-character, null-terminated string. The number of array elements is specified by <b>StringCount</b>. This member is valid only if <b>Flags</b> = DIAGNOSTIC_REASON_DETAILED_STRING. 

### -field SimpleString

A pointer to a wide-character, null-terminated string that explains the reason for a power request. This member is valid only if <b>Flags</b> = DIAGNOSTIC_REASON_SIMPLE_STRING. 

## -remarks
This structure is used by the <a href="kernel.pocreatepowerrequest">PoCreatePowerRequest</a> routine.

The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559829">power manager</a> uses the reason string or strings contained in this structure as a diagnostic aid during functional and performance testing.

The <b>COUNTED_REASON_CONTEXT</b> structure can contain either a simple reason string or a set of detailed reason strings. If <b>Flags</b> = DIAGNOSTIC_REASON_SIMPLE_STRING, the <b>SimpleString</b> member points to a string that explains the reason for the power request. If <b>Flags</b> = DIAGNOSTIC_REASON_DETAILED_STRING, the <b>ResourceFileName</b>, <b>ResourceReasonId</b>, <b>StringCount</b>, and <b>ReasonStrings</b> members can give a detailed set of reasons for the power request.

The DIAGNOSTIC_REASON_DETAILED_STRING flag supports localization. If the localized resource file specified by <b>ResourceFileName</b> exists, the power manager retrieves a set of resource strings from the file and uses these strings in place of the strings contained in the <b>ReasonStrings</b> array. <b>ResourceId</b> specifies the resource index of the first string in the file to use as a reason string, and <b>StringCount</b> specifies the number of resource strings to use as reason strings. The resource strings must have consecutive resource indexes.
