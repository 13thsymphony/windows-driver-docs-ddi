# IoCheckLinkShareAccess function
The <b>IoCheckLinkShareAccess</b> routine is called by file system drivers (FSDs) or other highest-level drivers to check whether link shared access to a file object is permitted.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS IoCheckLinkShareAccess(
  _In_        ACCESS_MASK        DesiredAccess,
  _In_        ULONG              DesiredShareAccess,
  _Inout_     PFILE_OBJECT       FileObject,
  _Inout_     PSHARE_ACCESS      ShareAccess,
  _Inout_opt_ PLINK_SHARE_ACCESS LinkShareAccess,
  _In_        ULONG              IoShareAccessFlags
);
````

## Parameters

`DesiredAccess`

Specifies an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540466">ACCESS_MASK</a> value that indicates the desired type of access to the given file object.

`DesiredShareAccess`

Specifies the desired type of shared access to the file object for the current open request. The value of this parameter is usually the same as the <i>ShareAccess</i> parameter that is passed to the file system or highest-level driver by the I/O manager when the open request was made. This value can be zero, or any combination of the following:

FILE_SHARE_READ

FILE_SHARE_WRITE

FILE_SHARE_DELETE

`FileObject`

A pointer to the file object for which to check access for the current open request.

`ShareAccess`

A pointer to the common share-access data structure that is associated with <i>FileObject</i>. Drivers should treat this structure as opaque.

`LinkShareAccess`

A pointer to the common link share-access data structure (<a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_link_share_access.md">LINK_SHARE_ACCESS</a>) that is associated with <i>FileObject</i>. Drivers should treat this structure as opaque.

`IoShareAccessFlags`

A bitmask of these flags:

IO_SHARE_ACCESS_NO_WRITE_PERMISSION        (0x80000000) specifies that the user has no write permission for the file. This flag is used to prevent opening a file for exclusive read access 
when the user does not have appropriate permissions. 

IO_CHECK_SHARE_ACCESS_UPDATE_SHARE_ACCESS  (0x00000001) indicates whether the SHARE_ACCESS structure
is updated.


## Return Value

The <b>IoCheckLinkShareAccess</b> routine returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the requester's access to the file object is compatible with the way in which it is currently open. If the request is denied because of a sharing violation, then STATUS_SHARING_VIOLATION is returned.

## Remarks

The <i>ShareAccess</i> parameter must be locked against other accesses
    from other threads while this routine is executing.  Otherwise the counts
    can be synchronization.

## Requirements
