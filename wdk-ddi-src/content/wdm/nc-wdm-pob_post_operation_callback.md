# POB_POST_OPERATION_CALLBACK callback function
The <i>ObjectPostCallback</i> routine is called by the operating system after a process or thread handle operation occurs.

## Syntax

```
POB_POST_OPERATION_CALLBACK PobPostOperationCallback;

void PobPostOperationCallback(
  PVOID RegistrationContext,
  POB_POST_OPERATION_INFORMATION OperationInformation
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`RegistrationContext`

The context that the driver specifies as the <i>CallBackRegistration</i>-&gt;<b>RegistrationContext</b> parameter of the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-obregistercallbacks.md">ObRegisterCallbacks</a> routine. The meaning of this value is driver-defined.

`OperationInformation`

A pointer to an <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_ob_post_operation_information.md">OB_POST_OPERATION_INFORMATION</a> structure that specifies the parameters of the handle operation.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

Use the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-obregistercallbacks.md">ObRegisterCallbacks</a> routine to register an <i>ObjectPostCallback</i> routine, and use the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-obunregistercallbacks.md">ObUnRegisterCallbacks</a> routine to unregister the routine.

An <i>ObjectPostCallback</i> routine is called after an operation on a process handle or thread handle completes, whereas an <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pob_pre_operation_callback.md">ObjectPreCallback</a> routine is called before the operation occurs. The <i>OperationInformation</i> parameter of the <i>ObjectPreCallback</i> routine is a pointer to an <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_ob_pre_operation_information.md">OB_PRE_OPERATION_INFORMATION</a> structure, which contains information that you can modify. In contrast, the <i>OperationInformation</i> parameter of the <i>ObjectPostCallback</i> routine is a pointer to an <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_ob_post_operation_information.md">OB_POST_OPERATION_INFORMATION</a> structure. The contents of this structure are informational and you cannot modify them.

This routine is called at PASSIVE_LEVEL in an arbitrary thread context with normal kernel APCs disabled. Special kernel APCs are not disabled. For more information about APCs, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564853">Types of APCs</a>.
