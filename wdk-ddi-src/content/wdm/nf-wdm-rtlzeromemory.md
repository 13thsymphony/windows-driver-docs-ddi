# RtlZeroMemory macro



## -description
The <b>RtlZeroMemory</b> routine fills a block of memory with zeros, given a pointer to the block and the length, in bytes, to be filled.



## -syntax

````
VOID RtlZeroMemory(
  _Out_ VOID UNALIGNED *Destination,
  _In_  SIZE_T         Length
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Destination [out]

A pointer to the memory block to be filled with zeros.


### -param Length [in]

The number of bytes to fill with zeros.


## -remarks
To zero out a memory buffer to erase security-sensitive data, use <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-rtlsecurezeromemory.md">RtlSecureZeroMemory</a> instead.

Callers of <b>RtlZeroMemory</b> can be running at any IRQL if the destination memory block is in nonpaged system memory. Otherwise, the caller must be running at IRQL &lt;= APC_LEVEL.
