# TRANSLATE_BUS_ADDRESS callback function
The <i>TranslateBusAddress</i> routine translates addresses on the parent bus to logical addresses.

## Syntax

```
TRANSLATE_BUS_ADDRESS TranslateBusAddress;

_IRQL_requires_same_ BOOLEAN TranslateBusAddress(
  PVOID Context,
  PHYSICAL_ADDRESS BusAddress,
  ULONG Length,
  PULONG AddressSpace,
  PPHYSICAL_ADDRESS TranslatedAddress
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`Context`

A pointer to interface-specific context information. The caller passes the value that is passed as the <b>Context</b> member of the <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_bus_interface_standard.md">BUS_INTERFACE_STANDARD</a> structure for the interface.

`BusAddress`

The bus-relative address to be translated.

`Length`

The length, in bytes, of the input memory that <i>BusAddress</i> points to.

`AddressSpace`

On input, the address space in which the device's hardware address resides. A value of 0x0 signifies memory space, and a value of 0x1 signifies port I/O space. On output, <i>AddressSpace</i> indicates the address space in which the <i>TranslatedAddress</i> resides.

`TranslatedAddress`

The translated (logical) address that corresponds to the bus-relative address that the caller provides in <i>BusAddress</i>.


## Return Value

The 
      <i>TranslateBusAddress</i> routine returns <b>TRUE</b> if the translation operation succeeded and <b>FALSE</b> otherwise.
