## -struct-fields

### -field Version

Contains a 3-bit integer that indicates the version of the <i>PCI Power Management Interface Specification </i>that the device complies with. For a list of values that can be assigned to this member, see the <i>PCI Local Bus Specification</i>. 

### -field PMEClock

Indicates, when 1, that the device relies on the presence of the PCI clock for operation of the PME signal. When this member is a "0", no PCI clock is required to generate the PME signal. 

### -field Rsvd1

Reserved. 

### -field DeviceSpecificInitialization

Indicates when 1 that the device requires a special initialization. For more information about this value, see the <i>PCI Local Bus Specification</i>.

### -field Rsvd2

Reserved. 

### -field Support


### -field Rsvd2

Reserved. 

### -field D1

Reserved. 

### -field D2

Reserved. 

### -field PMED0

Indicates that the device can assert the PME signal from D0. 

### -field PMED1

Indicates that the device can assert the PME signal from D1. 

### -field PMED2

Indicates that the device can assert the PME signal from D2. 

### -field PMED3Hot

Indicates that the device can assert the PME signal from D3. 

### -field PMED3Cold

Indicates that the device can assert the PME signal from D3.

## -remarks
The power management capabilities register, whose contents are reported in the PCI_PMC structure, provides information about the power management capabilities of the device.
