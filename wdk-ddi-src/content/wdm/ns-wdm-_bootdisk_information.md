# _BOOTDISK_INFORMATION structure
The <b>BOOTDISK_INFORMATION</b> structure contains basic information describing the boot and system disks.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _BOOTDISK_INFORMATION {
  LONGLONG BootPartitionOffset;
  LONGLONG SystemPartitionOffset;
  ULONG    BootDeviceSignature;
  ULONG    SystemDeviceSignature;
} BOOTDISK_INFORMATION, *PBOOTDISK_INFORMATION;
````

## Members


`BootDeviceSignature`

If the boot disk is formatted with an MBR partition table, this specifies the signature for the disk's MBR partition table. Otherwise, this member is unused.

`BootPartitionOffset`

Specifies the offset, in bytes, on the boot disk where the boot partition begins.

`SystemDeviceSignature`

If the system disk is formatted with an MBR partition table, this specifies the signature for the disk's MBR partition table. Otherwise, this member is unused.

`SystemPartitionOffset`

Specifies the offset, in bytes, on the system disk where the system partition begins.

## Remarks
<a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iogetbootdiskinformation.md">IoGetBootDiskInformation</a> returns this structure to describe the boot and system disks.

## Requirements
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| ---- |:---- |
| **Windows version** | Drivers on Microsoft Windows XP and later versions of the Windows operating system should use the BOOTDISK_INFORMATION_EX structure instead. Drivers on Microsoft Windows XP and later versions of the Windows operating system should use the BOOTDISK_INFORMATION_EX structure instead. |
| **Header** | wdm.h (include Wdm.h, Ntddk.h, Ntifs.h) |
