## Members


`SizeOfFastIoDispatch`

Set to <b>sizeof</b>(FAST_IO_DISPATCH).

`FastIoCheckIfPossible`

A pointer to a callback routine that checks if fast I/O is possible for a either a read or a write operation.

`FastIoRead`

A pointer to a callback routine that does a fast cached read, bypassing the IRP read path.  It is used to perform a copy read
    for a cached file object.

`FastIoWrite`

A pointer to a callback routine that does a fast cached write, bypassing the IRP write path.  It is used to perform a copy write
    for a cached file object.

`FastIoQueryBasicInfo`

A pointer to a callback routine for fast query of basic file information.

`FastIoQueryStandardInfo`

A pointer to a callback routine for fast query of standard file information.

`FastIoLock`

A pointer to a callback routine for doing a fast lock on a file object.

`FastIoUnlockSingle`

A pointer to a callback routine for doing a fast release of a single lock on a file object.

`FastIoUnlockAll`

A pointer to a callback routine for doing a fast release of a all locks held on a file object.

`FastIoUnlockAllByKey`

A pointer to a callback routine for doing a fast release of a all locks grouped by a key.

`FastIoDeviceControl`

A pointer to a callback routine for fast device control processing.

`AcquireFileForNtCreateSection`

A pointer to a callback routine used by the memory manager to acquire a file exclusively.

`ReleaseFileForNtCreateSection`

A pointer to a callback routine used by the memory manager to release a previously acquired file.

`FastIoDetachDevice`

A pointer to a callback routine that is invoked to detach the current device object from a device object that
    is being deleted.

`FastIoQueryNetworkOpenInfo`

A pointer to a callback routine for fast query of network file information.

`AcquireForModWrite`

A pointer to a callback routine that decides which file system resource the modified page
    writer should acquire and acquires it if possible.

`MdlRead`

A pointer to a callback routine that does a fast cached MDL read, bypassing the IRP read path.  It is used to perform a copy read
    for a cached file object.

`MdlReadComplete`

A pointer to a callback routine that performs a fast completion of an MDL read.

`PrepareMdlWrite`

A pointer to a callback routine that does a fast cached MDL write, bypassing the IRP write path.  It is used to perform a copy write
    for a cached file object.

`MdlWriteComplete`

A pointer to a callback routine that performs a fast completion of an MDL write.

`FastIoReadCompressed`

A pointer to a callback routine that performs a fast  compressed read of data from a file.

`FastIoWriteCompressed`

A pointer to a callback routine that performs a fast  compressed write of data to  a file.

`MdlReadCompleteCompressed`

A pointer to a callback routine that completes  a fast  MDL compressed read of data from  a file.

`MdlWriteCompleteCompressed`

A pointer to a callback routine that completes  a fast  MDL compressed write of data to  a file.

`FastIoQueryOpen`

A pointer to a callback routine that implements  a fast  open for path based queries.

`ReleaseForModWrite`

This routine releases a file system resource previously acquired for
    the modified page write.

`AcquireForCcFlush`

A pointer to a callback routine that acquires a file system resource prior to a cache flush.

`ReleaseForCcFlush`

A pointer to a callback routine that releases a file system resource previously acquired for a cache flush.
