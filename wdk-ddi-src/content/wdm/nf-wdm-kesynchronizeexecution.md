# KeSynchronizeExecution function



## -description
The <b>KeSynchronizeExecution</b> routine synchronizes the execution of the specified routine with the interrupt service routine (ISR) that is assigned to a set of one or more interrupt objects.



## -syntax

````
BOOLEAN KeSynchronizeExecution(
  _Inout_  PKINTERRUPT           Interrupt,
  _In_     PKSYNCHRONIZE_ROUTINE SynchronizeRoutine,
  _In_opt_ PVOID                 SynchronizeContext
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Interrupt [in, out]

A pointer to a set of interrupt objects. The caller obtained this pointer from the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-ioconnectinterrupt.md">IoConnectInterrupt</a> or <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-ioconnectinterruptex.md">IoConnectInterruptEx</a> routine.


### -param SynchronizeRoutine [in]

Specifies a caller-supplied <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563928">SynchCritSection</a> routine whose execution is to be synchronized with the execution of the ISR assigned to the interrupt objects.


### -param SynchronizeContext [in, optional]

A pointer to a caller-supplied context value to be passed to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563928">SynchCritSection</a> routine when it is called.


## -returns
<b>KeSynchronizeExecution</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, it returns <b>FALSE</b>.


## -remarks
When this routine is called, the following occurs:

The IRQL is raised to the <i>SynchronizeIrql</i> value specified in the call to <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-ioconnectinterrupt.md">IoConnectInterrupt</a> or <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-ioconnectinterruptex.md">IoConnectInterruptEx</a>.

Access to <i>SynchronizeContext</i> is synchronized with the assigned ISR by acquiring the associated interrupt object spin lock (or system event object, in the case of an ISR that runs at PASSIVE_LEVEL).

The specified <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563928">SynchCritSection</a> routine is called with the <i>SynchronizeContext</i> value as its parameter.

If the ISR runs at DIRQL &gt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL, the <i>SynchCritSection</i> routine runs at the same DIRQL and must therefore run for as brief a time as possible to avoid delaying other high-priority tasks.

Callers of <b>KeSynchronizeExecution</b> must be running at IRQL &lt;= DIRQL; that is, at an IRQL that is less than or equal to the value of the <b>SynchronizeIrql</b> value that the caller specified when it registered its ISR with <b>IoConnectInterrupt</b> or <b>IoConnectInterruptEx</b>.

Starting with Windows 8, a driver can call <b>KeSynchronizeExecution</b> to synchronize execution of a <i>SynchCritSection</i> routine with an ISR that runs at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL. In earlier versions of Windows, <b>KeSynchronizeExecution</b> can synchronize execution only with an ISR that runs at IRQL &gt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh698277">Using Passive-Level Interrupt Service Routines</a>.
