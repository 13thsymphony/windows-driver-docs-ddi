# _BOOTDISK_INFORMATION_EX structure
The <b>BOOTDISK_INFORMATION_EX</b> structure contains extended information describing the boot and system disks.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _BOOTDISK_INFORMATION_EX {
  LONGLONG BootPartitionOffset;
  LONGLONG SystemPartitionOffset;
  ULONG    BootDeviceSignature;
  ULONG    SystemDeviceSignature;
  GUID     BootDeviceGuid;
  GUID     SystemDeviceGuid;
  BOOLEAN  BootDeviceIsGpt;
  BOOLEAN  SystemDeviceIsGpt;
} BOOTDISK_INFORMATION_EX, *PBOOTDISK_INFORMATION_EX;
````

## Members


`BootDeviceGuid`

If the <b>BootDeviceIsGpt</b> member is <b>TRUE</b>, this specifies the GUID for the boot disk. Otherwise, this member is unused.

`BootDeviceIsGpt`

<b>TRUE</b> if the boot disk is formatted with the GPT partition table type.

`BootDeviceSignature`

If the <b>BootDeviceIsGpt</b> member is <b>FALSE</b>, this specifies the signature for the disk's MBR partition table. Otherwise, this member is unused.

`BootPartitionOffset`

Specifies the offset, in bytes, on the boot disk where the boot partition begins.

`SystemDeviceGuid`

If the <b>SystemDeviceIsGpt</b> member is <b>TRUE</b>, this specifies the GUID for the boot disk. Otherwise, this member is unused.

`SystemDeviceIsGpt`

<b>TRUE</b> if the system disk is formatted with the GPT partition table type.

`SystemDeviceSignature`

If the <b>SystemDeviceIsGpt</b> member is <b>FALSE</b>, this specifies the signature for the disk's MBR partition table. Otherwise, this member is unused.

`SystemPartitionOffset`

Specifies the offset, in bytes, on the system disk where the system partition begins.

## Remarks
On Windows XP and later, <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iogetbootdiskinformation.md">IoGetBootDiskInformation</a> returns this structure to describe the boot and system disks.
