# ExReleaseRundownProtection function



## -description
The <b>ExReleaseRundownProtection</b> routine releases run-down protection that the caller previously acquired by calling the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exacquirerundownprotection.md">ExAcquireRundownProtection</a> routine.



## -syntax

````
VOID ExReleaseRundownProtection(
  _Inout_ PEX_RUNDOWN_REF RunRef
);
````


## -parameters

### -param RunRef [in, out]

A pointer to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj569379">EX_RUNDOWN_REF</a> structure that was initialized by a previous call to the  <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exinitializerundownprotection.md">ExInitializeRundownProtection</a> routine. The run-down protection routines use this structure to track the run-down status of the associated shared object. This structure is opaque to drivers.


## -returns
None.


## -remarks
A driver that calls <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exacquirerundownprotection.md">ExAcquireRundownProtection</a> to acquire run-time protection for an object access is responsible for calling <b>ExReleaseRundownProtection</b> to release the run-time protection when the access is finished.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj569382">Run-Down Protection</a>.
