# ExReleaseRundownProtection function
The <b>ExReleaseRundownProtection</b> routine releases run-down protection that the caller previously acquired by calling the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj569371">ExAcquireRundownProtection</a> routine.

## Syntax

```
NTKERNELAPI VOID ExReleaseRundownProtection(
  PEX_RUNDOWN_REF RunRef
);
```

## Parameters

`RunRef`

A pointer to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj569379">EX_RUNDOWN_REF</a> structure that was initialized by a previous call to the  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj569373">ExInitializeRundownProtection</a> routine. The run-down protection routines use this structure to track the run-down status of the associated shared object. This structure is opaque to drivers.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

A driver that calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj569371">ExAcquireRundownProtection</a> to acquire run-time protection for an object access is responsible for calling <b>ExReleaseRundownProtection</b> to release the run-time protection when the access is finished.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj569382">Run-Down Protection</a>.
