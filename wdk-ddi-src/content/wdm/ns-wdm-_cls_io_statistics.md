# _CLS_IO_STATISTICS structure
The <b>CLFS_IO_STATISTICS</b> structure holds I/O statistics data for a Common Log File System (CLFS) log.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _CLS_IO_STATISTICS {
  CLFS_IO_STATISTICS_HEADER hdrIoStats;
  ULONGLONG                 cFlush;
  ULONGLONG                 cbFlush;
  ULONGLONG                 cMetaFlush;
  ULONGLONG                 cbMetaFlush;
} CLS_IO_STATISTICS, *PCLS_IO_STATISTICS, **PPCLS_IO_STATISTICS, CLFS_IO_STATISTICS, *PCLFS_IO_STATISTICS, **PPCLFS_IO_STATISTICS;
````
