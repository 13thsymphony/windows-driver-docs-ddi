# IoInitializeWorkItem function
The <b>IoInitializeWorkItem</b> routine initializes a work item that the caller has already allocated.

## Syntax

````
VOID IoInitializeWorkItem(
  _In_ PVOID        IoObject,
  _In_ PIO_WORKITEM IoWorkItem
);
````

## Parameters

`IoObject`

Pointer to the caller's driver object or to one of the caller's device objects. If the caller will later pass the work item to <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-ioqueueworkitem.md">IoQueueWorkItem</a>, <i>IoObject</i> must point to a device object.

`IoWorkItem`

Pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550679">IO_WORKITEM</a> structure to initialize.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

The driver allocates its own storage for an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550679">IO_WORKITEM</a> structure, and then calls <b>IoInitializeWorkItem</b> to initialize it. Memory must be allocated from nonpaged pool. To determine the number of bytes that is necessary to hold an <b>IO_WORKITEM</b> structure, call <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iosizeofworkitem.md">IoSizeofWorkItem</a>.

An <b>IO_WORKITEM</b> structure that is initialized by <b>IoInitializeWorkItem</b><u>must</u> be uninitialized by <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iouninitializeworkitem.md">IoUninitializeWorkItem</a> before it is freed.

A related routine, <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-ioallocateworkitem.md">IoAllocateWorkItem</a>, both allocates and initializes a work item. By combining allocation and initialization into a single call, <b>IoAllocateWorkItem</b> might be more convenient for some drivers to use than <b>IoInitializeWorkItem</b>, which does initialization only. However, <b>IoInitializeWorkItem</b> is required by drivers that must initialize work items in previously allocated storage.

For example, a driver might allocate a block of storage for a pool of work items. The driver can call <b>IoInitializeWorkItem</b> to initialize a work item when the work item is allocated from the pool. The driver can call <b>IoUninitializeWorkItem</b> to uninitialize the work item when it is returned to the pool. During the initial storage allocation for the pool, the driver can call <b>IoSizeofWorkitem</b> to determine how much storage to allocate for each work item.

For more information about work items, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564587">System Worker Threads</a>.
