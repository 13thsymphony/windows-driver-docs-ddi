# ClfsDeleteLogByPointer function
The <b>ClfsDeleteLogByPointer</b> routine marks a CLFS stream for deletion.

## Syntax

```
CLFSUSER_API NTSTATUS ClfsDeleteLogByPointer(
  PLOG_FILE_OBJECT plfoLog
);
```

## Parameters

`plfoLog`

A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554316">LOG_FILE_OBJECT</a> structure that represents an open instance of the stream to be deleted. The caller previously obtained this pointer by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540792">ClfsCreateLogFile</a>.


## Return Value

<b>ClfsDeleteLogByPointer</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if it succeeds; otherwise, it returns one of the error codes defined in Ntstatus.h.

## Remarks

<b>ClfsDeleteLogByPointer</b> marks a stream for deletion but does not close the log file object pointed to by <i>plfoLog</i>. To close a log file object, call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540789">ClfsCloseLogFileObject</a>. A stream marked for deletion is deleted after all log file objects associated with the stream are closed.

A CLFS stream marked for deletion will refuse subsequent requests to open the stream.

For an explanation of CLFS concepts and terminology, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a9685648-b08c-48ca-b020-e683068f2ea2">Common Log File System</a>.
