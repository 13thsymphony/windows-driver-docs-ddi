# ExDeleteTimer function
The <b>ExDeleteTimer</b> routine deletes a timer object that was previously allocated by the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exallocatetimer.md">ExAllocateTimer</a> routine.

## Syntax

````
BOOLEAN ExDeleteTimer(
  _In_ PEX_TIMER              Timer,
  _In_ BOOLEAN                Cancel,
  _In_ BOOLEAN                Wait,
  _In_ PEXT_DELETE_PARAMETERS Parameters
);
````

## Parameters

`Timer`

A pointer to an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/exxxxtimer-routines-and-ex-timer-objects">EX_TIMER</a> structure. This structure is a timer object that was previously allocated by the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exallocatetimer.md">ExAllocateTimer</a> routine.

`Cancel`

Whether to cancel the timer if it is currently set. If <b>TRUE</b>, the routine cancels the timer if the timer is set. If <b>FALSE</b>, the routine does not cancel the timer if it is set. If the caller sets <i>Wait</i> to <b>TRUE</b>, <i>Cancel</i> must also be <b>TRUE</b>; otherwise, a bug check occurs.

`Wait`

Whether to wait for the timer to finish expiring if the timer has already started the process of expiring. If <b>TRUE</b>, the routine waits for the timer to expire. If <b>FALSE</b>, the routine does not wait. For more information, see Remarks.

`Parameters`

A pointer to an <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_ext_delete_parameters.md">EXT_DELETE_PARAMETERS</a> structure. The calling driver previously called the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exinitializedeletetimerparameters.md">ExInitializeDeleteTimerParameters</a> routine to initialize this structure.


## Return Value

This routine returns <b>TRUE</b> if <i>Cancel</i> is <b>TRUE</b> and the timer was canceled. Otherwise, the routine returns <b>FALSE</b>. For more information, see Remarks.

## Remarks

After your driver calls this routine, the timer object pointed to by <i>Timer</i> might no longer be valid. However, the <i>Timer</i> parameter value passed to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn265190">ExTimerCallback</a> callback routine, if the driver implements this routine, is always a valid pointer to a timer object.

If <i>Cancel</i> is <b>TRUE</b>, a return value of <b>FALSE</b> indicates that the timer was never set, or that the timer was set but expired before it could be canceled.  If <i>Cancel</i> is <b>FALSE</b>, the routine always returns <b>FALSE</b>.

This routine can block if <i>Wait</i> is <b>TRUE</b>. If <b>ExDeleteTimer</b> is called from the driver's <i>ExTimerCallback</i> routine, which is called at DISPATCH_LEVEL, the <i>Wait</i> parameter in this call must be <b>FALSE</b>.

If <i>Wait</i> is <b>TRUE</b>, the routine must be called at IRQL &lt;= APC_LEVEL. If <i>Wait</i> is <b>FALSE</b>, the routine can be called at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn265175">Deleting a System-Allocated Timer Object</a>.
