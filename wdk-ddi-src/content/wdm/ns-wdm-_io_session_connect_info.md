# _IO_SESSION_CONNECT_INFO structure
The <b>IO_SESSION_CONNECT_INFO</b> structure provides information about a user session.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _IO_SESSION_CONNECT_INFO {
  ULONG   SessionId;
  BOOLEAN LocalSession;
} IO_SESSION_CONNECT_INFO, *PIO_SESSION_CONNECT_INFO;
````

## Members


`LocalSession`

Indicates whether the user session is a local session or a remote session. If <b>TRUE</b>, the user is logged on locally. If <b>FALSE</b>, the user is logged on remotely.

`SessionId`

Session ID. This member contains the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=155045">Terminal Services</a> session identifier of the user session for which the driver is receiving this notification.

## Remarks
If a driver is registered to receive notifications of events in a user session, and if this session enters the <i>connected</i> state, the I/O manager calls the driver's <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-io_session_notification_function.md">IO_SESSION_NOTIFICATION_FUNCTION</a> function. For this call, the I/O manager sets the function's <i>Event</i> parameter to <b>IoSessionEventConnected</b>. Additionally, the I/O manager sets the function's <i>NotificationPayload</i> parameter to point to an <b>IO_SESSION_CONNECT_INFO</b> structure that contains information about the user session. For more information about <b>IoSessionEventConnected</b>, see <a href="..\wdm\ne-wdm-_io_session_event.md">IO_SESSION_EVENT</a>.

## Requirements
