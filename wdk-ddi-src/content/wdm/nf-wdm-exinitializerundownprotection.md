# ExInitializeRundownProtection function
The <b>ExInitializeRundownProtection</b> routine initializes run-down protection on a shared object.

## Syntax

````
VOID ExInitializeRundownProtection(
  _Out_ PEX_RUNDOWN_REF RunRef
);
````

## Parameters

`RunRef`

A pointer to a caller-allocated <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj569379">EX_RUNDOWN_REF</a> structure that is to be initialized. The allocation must be 4-byte aligned on 32-bit platforms, and 8-byte aligned on 64-bit platforms. For more information, see Remarks.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

This routine is called by the driver that owns an object that resides in shared memory and is that accessed by other drivers.

<b>ExInitializeRundownProtection</b> must be called to initialize an <b>EX_RUNDOWN_REF</b> structure before it is passed as a parameter to any other run-down protection routine.

The run-down protection routines use the <b>EX_RUNDOWN_REF</b> structure to track the run-down status of a shared object that is associated with the structure. This status information includes a count of instances of run-down protection that are currently in effect on the object. <b>ExInitializeRundownProtection</b> initializes this count to zero.

After an <b>EX_RUNDOWN_REF</b> structure is initialized, other drivers that access the associated object can call the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exacquirerundownprotection.md">ExAcquireRundownProtection</a> and <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exreleaserundownprotection.md">ExReleaseRundownProtection</a> routines to acquire and release run-down protection on the object.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj569382">Run-Down Protection</a>.
