# MmLockPagableDataSection function
The <b>MmLockPagableDataSection</b> routine locks an entire section of driver data into system space.

## Syntax

````
PVOID MmLockPagableDataSection(
  _In_ PVOID AddressWithinSection
);
````

## Parameters

`AddressWithinSection`

Specifies the symbolic address of one item of data within the pageable section.


## Return Value

<b>MmLockPagableDataSection</b> returns an opaque value that identifies the section. This value must be passed subsequently to <b>MmLockPagableSectionByHandle</b> or to <b>MmUnlockPagableImageSection</b>.

## Remarks

Drivers can use this routine, <b>MmLockPagableSectionByHandle</b>, and <b>MmUnlockPagableImageSection</b> to make their private data that is typically pageable locked into memory.

Data can be locked down if:

<ul>
<li>
The data is typically accessed at &lt;= APC_LEVEL, but it might need to be accessed at higher IRQL levels for short periods. 

</li>
<li>
The driver uses the data infrequently and predictably. 

</li>
</ul>
For example, drivers for mixer devices use pageable-data sections. Because the driver uses sufficient data to make creating a pageable-data section worthwhile and the driver knows when the data is needed, such a driver uses <b>MmLockPagableDataSection</b>,  <b>MmLockPagableSectionByHandle</b> and <b>MmUnlockPagableImageSection</b> to bring a data section into system space when needed and make it available to be paged out when not needed.

A single call to <b>MmLockPagableDataSection</b> causes the entire section, containing the referenced data, to be locked into system space.

It is an expensive operation to lock down a section. If a pageable-data section is locked down in more than one place by a driver, use <b>MmLockPagableDataSection</b> for the first request. Make subsequent lock requests by calling <b>MmLockPagableSectionByHandle</b>, passing the handle returned by <b>MmLockPagableDataSection</b>. Locking by handle significantly improves driver performance. A locked down section is unlocked by calling <b>MmUnlockPagableImageSection</b>.

The memory manager maintains a reference count on the section. A pageable-data section is only available to be paged out when the reference count is zero. Every lock request increments the count; every unlock request decrements the count. A driver must unlock a section as many times as it locks a section to ensure that such a section will be available to be paged out when the section is not needed. A handle is always valid, no matter what the count. If the count on a handle is zero and a call is made to <b>MmLockPagableSectionByHandle</b>, the count is set to one, and if the section has been paged out, it will be paged in.

Data in a pageable-data section is marked by a compiler directive. To create a pageable data section, use <b>#pragma data_seg ("PAGE")</b>, at the beginning of the data module, and <b>#pragma data_seg ()</b> at the end of the module. The keyword <b>PAGE</b> is case-sensitive, that is, <b>PAGE</b> must be capitalized.

Note that there is also a <b>#pragma data_seg("INIT")</b> that is used to make data discardable after system initialization. Except for the use of <b>INIT</b> rather than <b>PAGE</b>, the syntax is the same. However the result is not; use of the <b>PAGE</b> directive makes the data section pageable. When the <b>INIT</b> directive is used, the data in the section is discarded as soon as the driver returns from its driver entry routine or its reinitialization routine if the driver has one.
