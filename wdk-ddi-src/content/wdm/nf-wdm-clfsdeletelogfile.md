# ClfsDeleteLogFile function
The <b>ClfsDeleteLogFile</b> routine marks a CLFS stream for deletion.

## Syntax

```
CLFSUSER_API NTSTATUS ClfsDeleteLogFile(
  PUNICODE_STRING puszLogFileName,
  PVOID           pvReserved,
  ULONG           fLogOptionFlag,
  PVOID           pvContext,
  ULONG           cbContext
);
```

## Parameters

`puszLogFileName`

A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564879">UNICODE_STRING</a> structure that supplies the name of the CLFS stream to be deleted. 

If the stream to be deleted is the only stream of a dedicated log, the name has the form log:<i>physical log name</i>, where <i>physical log name</i> is the path name of the physical log on the underlying file system.

If the stream to be deleted is one of the streams of a multiplexed log, the name has the form log:<i>physical log name</i>::<i>stream name</i>, where <i>physical log name</i> is the path name of  the physical log on the underlying file system and <i>stream name</i> is the unique name of the stream to be deleted.

`pvReserved`

TBD

`fLogOptionFlag`

A value that indicates the relationship between CLFS and the component that is deleting the log. For a list of possible values, see the description of the <i>fLogOptionFlag</i> parameter of the <b>ClfsCreateLogFile</b> routine.

`pvContext`

A pointer to a context. The way the context is interpreted depends on the value passed in <i>fLogOptionFlag</i>.

`cbContext`

The size, in bytes, of the context pointed to by <i>pvContex</i>t. If <i>pvContext</i> is not <b>NULL</b>, this parameter must be greater than zero.


## Return Value

<b>ClfsDeleteLogFile</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if it succeeds; otherwise, it returns one of the error codes defined in Ntstatus.h.

## Remarks

The Common Log File System (CLFS) uses the LOG_FILE_OBJECT structure to represent logs. The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540792">ClfsCreateLogFile</a> function returns a pointer to LOG_FILE_OBJECT, which clients then pass to other CLFS functions.

CLFS clients do not directly access the members of a LOG_FILE_OBJECT structure. For information about the members, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545834">FILE_OBJECT</a>.



<b>ClfsDeleteLogFile</b> marks a stream for deletion but does not close any log file objects that are currently open. To close a log file object, call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540789">ClfsCloseLogFileObject</a>. A stream marked for deletion is deleted after all log file objects associated with the stream are closed.

A CLFS stream marked for deletion will refuse subsequent requests to open the stream.

The name of a physical CLFS log does not include the .blf extension.

For an explanation of CLFS concepts and terminology, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a9685648-b08c-48ca-b020-e683068f2ea2">Common Log File System</a>.
