# ClfsDeleteLogFile function



## -description
The <b>ClfsDeleteLogFile</b> routine marks a CLFS stream for deletion.



## -syntax

````
NTSTATUS ClfsDeleteLogFile(
  _In_     PUNICODE_STRING puszLogFileName,
  _In_opt_ PVOID           psdLogFile,
  _In_     ULONG           fLogOptionFlag,
  _In_opt_ PVOID           pvContext,
  _In_     ULONG           cbContext
);
````


## -parameters

### -param puszLogFileName [in]

A pointer to a <a href="..\wudfwdm\ns-wudfwdm-_unicode_string.md">UNICODE_STRING</a> structure that supplies the name of the CLFS stream to be deleted. 

If the stream to be deleted is the only stream of a dedicated log, the name has the form log:<i>physical log name</i>, where <i>physical log name</i> is the path name of the physical log on the underlying file system.

If the stream to be deleted is one of the streams of a multiplexed log, the name has the form log:<i>physical log name</i>::<i>stream name</i>, where <i>physical log name</i> is the path name of  the physical log on the underlying file system and <i>stream name</i> is the unique name of the stream to be deleted.


### -param psdLogFile [in, optional]

A pointer to a <a href="..\ntifs\ns-ntifs-_security_descriptor.md">SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR</a> structure that supplies the security attributes for accessing the stream. This parameter can be <b>NULL</b>.


### -param fLogOptionFlag [in]

A value that indicates the relationship between CLFS and the component that is deleting the log. For a list of possible values, see the description of the <i>fLogOptionFlag</i> parameter of the <b>ClfsCreateLogFile</b> routine.


### -param pvContext [in, optional]

A pointer to a context. The way the context is interpreted depends on the value passed in <i>fLogOptionFlag</i>.


### -param cbContext [in]

The size, in bytes, of the context pointed to by <i>pvContex</i>t. If <i>pvContext</i> is not <b>NULL</b>, this parameter must be greater than zero.


## -returns
<b>ClfsDeleteLogFile</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if it succeeds; otherwise, it returns one of the error codes defined in Ntstatus.h.


## -remarks
<b>ClfsDeleteLogFile</b> marks a stream for deletion but does not close any log file objects that are currently open. To close a log file object, call <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-clfscloselogfileobject.md">ClfsCloseLogFileObject</a>. A stream marked for deletion is deleted after all log file objects associated with the stream are closed.

A CLFS stream marked for deletion will refuse subsequent requests to open the stream.

The name of a physical CLFS log does not include the .blf extension.
