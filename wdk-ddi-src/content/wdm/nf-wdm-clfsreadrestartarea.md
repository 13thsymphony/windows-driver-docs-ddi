# ClfsReadRestartArea function
The <b>ClfsReadRestartArea</b> routine reads the restart record that was most recently written to a specified CLFS stream.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS ClfsReadRestartArea(
  _Inout_ PVOID     pvMarshalContext,
  _Out_   PVOID     *ppvRestartBuffer,
  _Out_   PULONG    pcbRestartBuffer,
  _Out_   PCLFS_LSN plsn,
  _Out_   PVOID     *ppvReadContext
);
````

## Parameters

`pvMarshalContext`

A pointer to an opaque context that represents a marshalling area associated with a CLFS stream. The caller previously obtained this pointer by calling <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-clfscreatemarshallingarea.md">ClfsCreateMarshallingArea</a>.

`ppvRestartBuffer`

A pointer to a variable that receives a pointer to the data buffer of the restart record.

`pcbRestartBuffer`

A pointer to a ULONG-typed variable that receives the size, in bytes, of the data buffer pointed to by <i>pcbRestartBuffer</i>. This is the length of the data buffer of the restart record.

`plsn`

A pointer to a CLFS_LSN structure that receives the LSN of the restart record that was read.

`ppvReadContext`

A pointer to a variable that receives a pointer to an opaque read context. The caller can pass this context to <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-clfsreadpreviousrestartarea.md">ClfsReadPreviousRestartArea</a> or <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-clfsreadnextlogrecord.md">ClfsReadNextLogRecord</a>. When the caller has finished using the read context, it must free the context by calling <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-clfsterminatereadlog.md">ClfsTerminateReadLog</a>.


## Return Value

<b>ClfsReadRestartArea</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if it succeeds; otherwise, it returns one of the error codes defined in Ntstatus.h.

## Remarks

For an explanation of CLFS concepts and terminology, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a9685648-b08c-48ca-b020-e683068f2ea2">Common Log File System</a>.

For information about reading records from CLFS streams, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560785">Reading Data Records from a CLFS Stream</a> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560786">Reading Restart Records from a CLFS Stream</a>.

Read contexts are not thread-safe. Clients are responsible for serializing access to read contexts.
