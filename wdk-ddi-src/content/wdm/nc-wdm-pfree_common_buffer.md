# PFREE_COMMON_BUFFER callback function
The <b>FreeCommonBuffer</b> routine frees a common buffer allocated by <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pallocate_common_buffer.md">AllocateCommonBuffer</a>, along with all resources the buffer uses.

## Syntax

```
PFREE_COMMON_BUFFER PfreeCommonBuffer;

void PfreeCommonBuffer(
  PDMA_ADAPTER DmaAdapter,
  ULONG Length,
  PHYSICAL_ADDRESS LogicalAddress,
  PVOID VirtualAddress,
  BOOLEAN CacheEnabled
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`DmaAdapter`

Pointer to the <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_dma_adapter.md">DMA_ADAPTER</a> structure returned by <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iogetdmaadapter.md">IoGetDmaAdapter</a> that represents the bus-master adapter or DMA controller.

`Length`

Specifies the number of bytes to deallocate.

`LogicalAddress`

Specifies the logical address of the allocated memory range.

`VirtualAddress`

Pointer to the corresponding virtual address of the allocated memory range.

`CacheEnabled`

Indicates whether the allocated memory is cached.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

<b>FreeCommonBuffer</b>
           is not a system routine that can be called directly by name. This routine is callable only by pointer from the address returned in a 
          <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_dma_operations.md">DMA_OPERATIONS</a>
           structure. Drivers obtain the address of this routine by calling <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iogetdmaadapter.md">IoGetDmaAdapter</a>.

To release a common buffer, a driver calls <b>FreeCommonBuffer</b> to unmap both its logical and virtual addresses. The parameters passed to <b>FreeCommonBuffer</b> must match exactly those passed to and returned from <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pallocate_common_buffer.md">AllocateCommonBuffer</a>. A driver cannot free part of an allocated common buffer.
