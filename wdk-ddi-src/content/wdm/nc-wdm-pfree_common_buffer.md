# PFREE_COMMON_BUFFER callback



## -description
The <b>FreeCommonBuffer</b> routine frees a common buffer allocated by <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pallocate_common_buffer.md">AllocateCommonBuffer</a>, along with all resources the buffer uses.



## -prototype

````
PFREE_COMMON_BUFFER FreeCommonBuffer;

VOID FreeCommonBuffer(
  _In_ PDMA_ADAPTER     DmaAdapter,
  _In_ ULONG            Length,
  _In_ PHYSICAL_ADDRESS LogicalAddress,
  _In_ PVOID            VirtualAddress,
  _In_ BOOLEAN          CacheEnabled
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param DmaAdapter [in]

Pointer to the <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_dma_adapter.md">DMA_ADAPTER</a> structure returned by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549220">IoGetDmaAdapter</a> that represents the bus-master adapter or DMA controller.


### -param Length [in]

Specifies the number of bytes to deallocate.


### -param LogicalAddress [in]

Specifies the logical address of the allocated memory range.


### -param VirtualAddress [in]

Pointer to the corresponding virtual address of the allocated memory range.


### -param CacheEnabled [in]

Indicates whether the allocated memory is cached.


## -returns
None


## -remarks
<b>FreeCommonBuffer</b>
           is not a system routine that can be called directly by name. This routine is callable only by pointer from the address returned in a 
          <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_dma_operations.md">DMA_OPERATIONS</a>
           structure. Drivers obtain the address of this routine by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549220">IoGetDmaAdapter</a>.

To release a common buffer, a driver calls <b>FreeCommonBuffer</b> to unmap both its logical and virtual addresses. The parameters passed to <b>FreeCommonBuffer</b> must match exactly those passed to and returned from <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pallocate_common_buffer.md">AllocateCommonBuffer</a>. A driver cannot free part of an allocated common buffer.
