# _GENERIC_MAPPING structure
The <b>GENERIC_MAPPING</b> structure describes the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540466">ACCESS_MASK</a> value of specific access rights associated with each type of generic access right.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _GENERIC_MAPPING {
  ACCESS_MASK GenericRead;
  ACCESS_MASK GenericWrite;
  ACCESS_MASK GenericExecute;
  ACCESS_MASK GenericAll;
} GENERIC_MAPPING, *PGENERIC_MAPPING;
````

## Members


`GenericAll`

Describes the specific access rights corresponding to the GENERIC_ALL access right.

`GenericExecute`

Describes the specific access rights corresponding to the GENERIC_EXECUTE access right.

`GenericRead`

Describes the specific access rights corresponding to the GENERIC_READ access right.

`GenericWrite`

Describes the specific access rights corresponding to the GENERIC_WRITE access right.

## Remarks
Use the <a href="..\ntddk\nf-ntddk-iogetfileobjectgenericmapping.md">IoGetFileObjectGenericMapping</a> routine to get the specific access rights corresponding to generic access rights for file objects. Use <a href="..\ntddk\nf-ntddk-rtlmapgenericmask.md">RtlMapGenericMask</a> to subtract off the access rights within an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540466">ACCESS_MASK</a> that do not derive from generic access rights.

For more information about generic access rights, see the reference page for <b>GENERIC_MAPPING</b> in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.
