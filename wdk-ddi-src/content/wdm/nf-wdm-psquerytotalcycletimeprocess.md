# PsQueryTotalCycleTimeProcess function
The <b>PsQueryTotalCycleTimeProcess</b> routine returns the accumulated cycle time for the specified process.

## Syntax

````
ULONG64 PsQueryTotalCycleTimeProcess(
  _Inout_ PEPROCESS Process,
  _Out_   PULONG64  CycleTimeStamp
);
````

## Parameters

`Process`

A pointer to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544273">EPROCESS</a> structure that serves as the kernel object for the process.

`CycleTimeStamp`

A pointer to a ULONG64 variable to which the routine writes the current cycle counter value for the process.


## Return Value

<b>PsQueryTotalCycleTimeProcess</b> returns the accumulated cycle time for the specified process.

## Remarks

This routine uses the time stamp counter to get the number of processor clock cycles used by the specified process.
