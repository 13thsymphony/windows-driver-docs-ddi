# ExReleaseSpinLockShared function
The <b>ExReleaseSpinLockShared</b> routine releases ownership of a  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/a37c0db4-ff9c-4958-a9f4-62b671458d03">spin lock</a> that the caller previously acquired for shared access, and restores the IRQL to its original value.

## Syntax

````
VOID ExReleaseSpinLockShared (
  _Inout_ PEX_SPIN_LOCK SpinLock,
  _In_    KIRQL         OldIrql
);
````

## Parameters

`Arg1`



`OldIrql`

The interrupt request level (IRQL) to restore. Set this parameter to the KIRQL value that was returned by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh451053">ExAcquireSpinLockShared</a> call that acquired the spin lock.


## Return Value

None.

## Remarks

This routine must be called only for a spin lock that is owned by the caller.

On entry to this routine, the caller must be running at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL. Before exiting, <b>ExReleaseSpinLockShared</b> restores the IRQL to the value specified by the <i>OldIrql</i> parameter.

The caller should hold the spin lock only briefly before releasing it. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548114">Introduction to Spin Locks</a>.
