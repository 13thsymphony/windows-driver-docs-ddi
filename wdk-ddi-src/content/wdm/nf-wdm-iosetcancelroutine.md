# IoSetCancelRoutine function
The <b>IoSetCancelRoutine</b> routine sets up a driver-supplied <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh406716">Cancel</a> routine to be called if a given IRP is canceled.

## Syntax

````
PDRIVER_CANCEL IoSetCancelRoutine(
  _In_ PIRP           Irp,
  _In_ PDRIVER_CANCEL CancelRoutine
);
````

## Parameters

`Irp`

Pointer to the IRP being put into or removed from a cancelable state.

`CancelRoutine`

Specifies the entry point of the caller-supplied <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh406716">Cancel</a> routine to be called if the specified IRP is canceled or is <b>NULL</b> if the given IRP is being removed from the cancelable state. This routine is declared as follows:
<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>VOID
(*PDRIVER_CANCEL)(
    IN PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject,
    IN PIRP Irp
    );</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>


## Return Value

<b>IoSetCancelRoutine</b> returns the previous value of <i>Irp</i>-&gt;<b>CancelRoutine</b>. If no <i>Cancel</i> routine was previously set, or if IRP cancellation is already in progress, <b>IoSetCancelRoutine</b> returns <b>NULL</b>.

## Remarks

This routine can disable the <i>Cancel</i> routine currently set in an IRP.

A driver must hold the system cancel spin lock when calling this routine if the driver uses the I/O manager-supplied device queue in the device object. The driver runs at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL after calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548196">IoAcquireCancelSpinLock</a> until it releases the cancel spin lock with <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549550">IoReleaseCancelSpinLock</a>.

If the driver manages its own queues of IRPs, then the driver need not hold the cancel spin lock when calling this routine. <b>IoSetCancelRoutine</b> uses an interlocked exchange intrinsic to set the address of the <i>Cancel</i> routine as an atomic operation. Reduced usage of the cancel spin lock can improve driver performance and overall system performance.

Driver <i>Cancel</i> routines are called at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL with the cancel spin lock held. The <i>Cancel</i> routine must release the cancel spin lock before it returns control.
