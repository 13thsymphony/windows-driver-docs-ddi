# _REG_SET_KEY_SECURITY_INFORMATION structure



## -description
The <b>REG_SET_KEY_SECURITY_INFORMATION</b> structure specifies security information for a registry key object.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _REG_SET_KEY_SECURITY_INFORMATION {
  PVOID                 Object;
  PSECURITY_INFORMATION SecurityInformation;
  PSECURITY_DESCRIPTOR  SecurityDescriptor;
  PVOID                 CallContext;
  PVOID                 ObjectContext;
  PVOID                 Reserved;
} REG_SET_KEY_SECURITY_INFORMATION, *PREG_SET_KEY_SECURITY_INFORMATION;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field Object

A pointer to the registry key object for the key whose security information is being set.


### -field SecurityInformation

A pointer to a <a href="ifsk.security_information">SECURITY_INFORMATION</a>-typed variable that identifies the type of security information that is being set.


### -field SecurityDescriptor

A pointer to a <a href="ifsk.security_descriptor">SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR</a> structure that contains security information for the key object.


### -field CallContext

Optional driver-defined context information that the driver's <a href="kernel.registrycallback">RegistryCallback</a> routine can supply. This member is defined for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system.


### -field ObjectContext

A pointer to driver-defined context information that the driver has associated with a registry object by calling <a href="kernel.cmsetcallbackobjectcontext">CmSetCallbackObjectContext</a>. This member is defined for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system.


### -field Reserved

This member is reserved for future use. This member is defined for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system.


## -remarks
The system passes the <b>REG_SET_KEY_SECURITY_INFORMATION</b> structure to the <a href="kernel.registrycallback">RegistryCallback</a> routine every time a thread attempts to set a key's security information—for example, when a driver calls <a href="kernel.zwsetsecurityobject">ZwSetSecurityObject</a>.
