## Remarks
All members of this structure, with the exception of <b>Size</b>, are pointers to functions that drivers use to perform DMA operations for their devices. Drivers obtain these pointers by calling the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549220">IoGetDmaAdapter</a> routine. The version of the <b>DMA_OPERATIONS</b> structure that this routine returns depends on the <b>Version</b> member of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543107">DEVICE_DESCRIPTION</a> structure that is passed to <b>IoGetDmaAdapter</b> as an input parameter. If <b>Version</b> is DEVICE_DESCRIPTION_VERSION or DEVICE_DESCRIPTION_VERSION1, version 1 of this structure is returned. If <b>Version</b> is DEVICE_DESCRIPTION_VERSION2, version 2 of this structure is returned. Version 2 of <b>DMA_OPERATIONS</b> is available starting with  Windows XP. If <b>Version</b> is DEVICE_DESCRIPTION_VERSION3, version 3 of this structure is returned. Version 3 of <b>DMA_OPERATIONS</b> is available starting with  WindowsÂ 8.
