# KeRestoreFloatingPointState function
The <b>KeRestoreFloatingPointState</b> routine restores the nonvolatile floating-point context saved by the preceding call to <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-kesavefloatingpointstate.md">KeSaveFloatingPointState</a>.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS KeRestoreFloatingPointState(
  _In_ PKFLOATING_SAVE FloatSave
);
````

## Parameters

`FloatSave`

A pointer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554233">KFLOATING_SAVE</a> structure that was passed in the preceding call to <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-kesavefloatingpointstate.md">KeSaveFloatingPointState</a>.


## Return Value

<b>KeRestoreFloatingPointState</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS.

## Remarks

<b>KeRestoreFloatingPointState</b> is the reciprocal of <b>KeSaveFloatingPointState</b>. 

Any routine that calls <b>KeSaveFloatingPointState</b><i> must</i> call <b>KeRestoreFloatingPointState</b> before that routine returns control, and it must be running at the same IRQL as that from which the preceding call to <b>KeSaveFloatingPointState</b> occurred. Failure to meet either of these conditions causes a system bug check.

Kernel-mode driver code must ensure that calls to <b>KeSaveFloatingPointState</b> and <b>KeRestoreFloatingPointState</b> are properly nested. This is required so that, at each nesting level, the state that was restored by the <b>KeRestoreFloatingPointState</b> call is the same state that was saved by the corresponding <b>KeSaveFloatingPointState</b> call. To ensure proper nesting, kernel-mode driver code must follow these rules:
<ul>
<li>
A <b>KeRestoreFloatingPointState</b> call that restores a saved state must be running at the same IRQL as the <b>KeSaveFloatingPointState</b> call that saved the state.

</li>
<li>
If a pair of <b>KeSaveFloatingPointState</b> and <b>KeRestoreFloatingPointState</b> calls is nested within a pair of surrounding <b>KeSaveFloatingPointState</b> and <b>KeRestoreFloatingPointState</b> calls, the IRQL for the nested calls must not be lower than the IRQL for the surrounding calls. 

</li>
<li>
Typically, the caller-allocated <b>KFLOATING_SAVE</b> structure that contains the state that was saved by <b>KeSaveFloatingPointState</b> resides on the stack. The stack naturally preserves the nesting of saved state information. If driver code stores the state in a location other than the stack, the driver writer must take special care to preserve the nesting of the <b>KeSaveFloatingPointState</b> and <b>KeRestoreFloatingPointState</b> calls. 

</li>
<li>
The <b>KeRestoreFloatingPointState</b> call that restores a saved state must be running in the same thread as the <b>KeSaveFloatingPointState</b> call that saved the state. 

</li>
</ul>
