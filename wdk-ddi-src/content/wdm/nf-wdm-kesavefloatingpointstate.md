# KeSaveFloatingPointState function
The <b>KeSaveFloatingPointState</b> routine saves the nonvolatile floating-point context so the caller can carry out floating-point operations.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS KeSaveFloatingPointState(
  _Out_ PKFLOATING_SAVE FloatSave
);
````

## Parameters

`FloatSave`

Pointer to a caller-allocated resident buffer, which must be at least <b>sizeof</b>(<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554233">KFLOATING_SAVE</a>).


## Return Value

<b>KeSaveFloatingPointState</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if it saved the current thread's floating-point context and set up a fresh floating-point context for the caller. Otherwise, it returns one of the following error status codes.

</td>
<td width="60%">
The system is configured to use floating-point emulation, rather than doing floating-point operations in the processors.

</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
<b>KeSaveFloatingPointState</b> could not allocate sufficient memory to save the current thread's floating-point context.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

A successful call to <b>KeSaveFloatingPointState</b> allows the caller to carry out floating-point operations of its own, but such a caller must restore the previous nonvolatile floating-point context as soon as its floating-point operations are done. Any routine that calls <b>KeSaveFloatingPointState</b> must call <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-kerestorefloatingpointstate.md">KeRestoreFloatingPointState</a> before that routine returns control.

If the call to <b>KeSaveFloatingPointState</b> is successful, the data at <i>FloatSave</i> is opaque to the caller. The caller should not release the memory that it allocated for this data until after the call to <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-kerestorefloatingpointstate.md">KeRestoreFloatingPointState</a>.

In Windows Vista and earlier versions of Windows, a <b>KeSaveFloatingPointState</b> call and the corresponding <b>KeRestoreFloatingPointState</b> call must occur in a guarded region. That is, the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-keenterguardedregion.md">KeEnterGuardedRegion</a> routine must be called before <b>KeSaveFloatingPointState</b> is called, and the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-keleaveguardedregion.md">KeLeaveGuardedRegion</a> routine must be called after <b>KeRestoreFloatingPointState</b> is called. No such requirement exists in Windows 7 and later versions of Windows.

For performance reasons, drivers should avoid doing any floating-point operations unless absolutely necessary. The overhead of saving and restoring the current thread's nonvolatile floating-point state degrades the performance of any driver that does floating-point operations.
