# _KINTERRUPT_POLARITY Enumeration
The <b>KINTERRUPT_POLARITY</b> enumeration indicates how a device signals an interrupt request on an interrupt line.

## Syntax
````
typedef enum _KINTERRUPT_POLARITY { 
  InterruptPolarityUnknown,
  InterruptActiveHigh,
  InterruptRisingEdge             = InterruptActiveHigh,
  InterruptActiveLow,
  InterruptFallingEdge            = InterruptActiveLow,
  InterruptActiveBoth,
  InterruptActiveBothTriggerLow   = InterruptActiveBoth,
  InterruptActiveBothTriggerHigh
} KINTERRUPT_POLARITY, *PKINTERRUPT_POLARITY;
````

## Constants

<table>

<tr>
<td>InterruptActiveBoth</td>
<td>Active-both interrupt. The interrupt input type is edge-triggered, and an interrupt request is indicated by a low-to-high or a high-to-low transition on the interrupt line. After a low-to-high transition signals an interrupt request, the interrupt line remains high until a high-to-low transition signals the next interrupt request. Similarly, after a high-to-low transition signals an interrupt request, the interrupt line remains low until a low-to-high transition signals the next interrupt request.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>InterruptActiveBothTriggerHigh</td>
<td>Reserved for use by the operating system.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>InterruptActiveBothTriggerLow</td>
<td>Reserved for use by the operating system.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>InterruptActiveHigh</td>
<td>Active-high interrupt. The interrupt input type is level-triggered, and an interrupt request is indicated by a high signal level on the interrupt line. The request remains active as long as the line remains high.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>InterruptActiveLow</td>
<td>Active-low interrupt. The interrupt input type is level-triggered, and an interrupt request is indicated by a low signal level on the interrupt line. The request remains active as long as the line remains low.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>InterruptFallingEdge</td>
<td>Falling-edge-triggered interrupt. The interrupt input type is edge-triggered, and an interrupt request is indicated by a high-to-low transition on the interrupt line.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>InterruptPolarityUnknown</td>
<td>The interrupt polarity is unknown.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>InterruptRisingEdge</td>
<td>Rising-edge-triggered interrupt. The interrupt input type is edge-triggered, and an interrupt request is indicated by a low-to-high transition on the interrupt line.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Remarks

A <b>KINTERRUPT_POLARITY</b> enumeration constant is frequently used in conjunction with a <a href="..\wdm\ne-wdm-_kinterrupt_mode.md">KINTERRUPT_MODE</a> enumeration constant to describe an interrupt signal. A <b>KINTERRUPT_MODE</b> enumeration constant indicates whether the interrupt signal from a device is level-triggered or edge-triggered.

## Requirements
