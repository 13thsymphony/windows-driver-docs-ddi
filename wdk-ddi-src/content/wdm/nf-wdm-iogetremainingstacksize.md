# IoGetRemainingStackSize function
The <b>IoGetRemainingStackSize</b> routine returns the current amount of available kernel-mode stack space.

## Syntax

````
ULONG_PTR IoGetRemainingStackSize(void);
````

## Parameters

This function has no parameters.

## Return Value

<b>IoGetRemainingStackSize</b> returns the number of bytes of stack space in the current thread context.

## Remarks

Highest-level drivers, such as file systems, can call this routine, particularly drivers that use recursive code paths. Such a driver would call <b>IoGetRemainingStackSize</b> before launching a recursion to determine whether it should continue processing on an alternate code path.

For Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 (SP1) and later versions of Windows, callers of <b>IoGetRemainingStackSize</b> can be running at any IRQL. For earlier versions of Windows, the caller must be running at IRQL &lt;= APC_LEVEL.
