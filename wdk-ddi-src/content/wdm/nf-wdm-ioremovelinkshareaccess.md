# IoRemoveLinkShareAccess function
The <b>IoRemoveLinkShareAccess</b> routine removes the access and link share-access information for a given open instance of a file object.

## Syntax

````
VOID IoRemoveLinkShareAccess(
  _In_        PFILE_OBJECT       FileObject,
  _Inout_     PSHARE_ACCESS      ShareAccess,
  _Inout_opt_ PLINK_SHARE_ACCESS LinkShareAccess
);
````

## Parameters

`FileObject`

Pointer to the file object, which usually is being closed by the current thread.

`ShareAccess`

Pointer to the share-access structure that describes how the open file object is currently being accessed.

`LinkShareAccess`

Pointer to the share-access structure that describes how the open file object is currently being accessed.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

This routine is a reciprocal to <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-ioupdatelinkshareaccess.md">IoUpdateLinkShareAccess</a>.

<b>IoRemoveLinkShareAccess</b> is not an atomic operation. Therefore, drivers calling this routine must protect the shared file object passed to <b>IoRemoveLinkShareAccess</b> by means of some kind of lock, such as a mutex or a resource lock, in order to prevent corruption of the shared access counts.

Callers of <b>IoRemoveLinkShareAccess</b> must be running at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL and in the context of the thread that requested that the <i>FileObject</i> be closed.
