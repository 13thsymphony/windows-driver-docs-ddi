# IoMarkIrpPending function
The <b>IoMarkIrpPending</b> routine marks the specified IRP, indicating that a driver's dispatch routine subsequently returned STATUS_PENDING because further processing is required by other driver routines.

## Syntax

````
VOID IoMarkIrpPending(
  _Inout_ PIRP Irp
);
````

## Parameters

`Irp`

Pointer to the IRP to be marked as pending.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

Unless the driver's dispatch routine completes the IRP (by calling <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iocompleterequest.md">IoCompleteRequest</a>) or passes the IRP on to lower drivers, it must call <b>IoMarkIrpPending</b> with the IRP. Otherwise, the I/O manager attempts to complete the IRP as soon as the dispatch routine returns control.

After calling <b>IoMarkIrpPending</b>, the dispatch routine must return STATUS_PENDING, even if some routine completes the IRP (by calling <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iocompleterequest.md">IoCompleteRequest</a>) before the dispatch routine that called <b>IoMarkIrpPending</b> returns.

If a driver queues incoming IRPs, it should call <b>IoMarkIrpPending</b> before it queues each IRP. Otherwise, an IRP could be dequeued, completed by another driver routine, and freed by the system before the call to <b>IoMarkIrpPending</b> occurs, thereby causing a crash.

If a driver sets an <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-io_completion_routine.md">IoCompletion</a> routine for an IRP and then passes the IRP down to a lower driver, the <i>IoCompletion</i> routine should check the <b>IRP-&gt;PendingReturned</b> flag. If the flag is set, the <i>IoCompletion</i> routine must call <b>IoMarkIrpPending</b> with the IRP. (<i>IoCompletion</i> routines do not return STATUS_PENDING, however. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547084">Implementing an IoCompletion Routine</a>.) 

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Drivers that create the IRP and send it to another stack must not call <b>IoMarkIrpPending</b> in their completion routine. This call will corrupt the pool header of the next allocation because there is no stack location for those drivers.</div>
<div> </div>
A driver that passes down the IRP and then waits on an event should not mark the IRP pending. Instead, its <i>IoCompletion</i> routine should signal the event and return STATUS_MORE_PROCESSING_REQUIRED.

If your driver calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550355">IoSkipCurrentIrpStackLocation</a>, be careful not to modify the <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_io_stack_location.md">IO_STACK_LOCATION</a> structure in a way that could unintentionally affect the lower driver or the system's behavior with respect to that driver. In particular, your driver should not modify the <b>IO_STACK_LOCATION</b> structure's <b>Parameters</b> union, and should not call <b>IoMarkIrpPending</b>.
