# IoCreateSystemThread function
The <b>IoCreateSystemThread</b> routine creates a system thread that executes in kernel mode, and supplies a handle for the thread.

## Syntax

````
NTSTATUS IoCreateSystemThread(
  _Inout_   PVOID              IoObject,
  _Out_     PHANDLE            ThreadHandle,
  _In_      ULONG              DesiredAccess,
  _In_opt_  POBJECT_ATTRIBUTES ObjectAttributes,
  _In_opt_  HANDLE             ProcessHandle,
  _Out_opt_ PCLIENT_ID         ClientId,
  _In_      PKSTART_ROUTINE    StartRoutine,
  _In_opt_  PVOID              StartContext
);
````

## Parameters

`IoObject`

A pointer to the <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_device_object.md">DEVICE_OBJECT</a> or <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_driver_object.md">DRIVER_OBJECT</a> to associate with          the created thread. <b>IoCreateSystemThread</b> takes a counted reference to this object. The I/O manager later releases this reference when the thread exits. For more information, see Remarks.

`ThreadHandle`

A pointer to a variable to which the routine writes the kernel handle for the created thread. When the handle is no longer needed, the driver must close the handle by calling the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-zwclose.md">ZwClose</a> routine.

`DesiredAccess`

The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540466">ACCESS_MASK</a> value that represents the types of access the caller requests to the created thread.

`ObjectAttributes`

A pointer to an <a href="..\wudfwdm\ns-wudfwdm-_object_attributes.md">OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES</a> structure that specifies the thread object's attributes. The OBJ_PERMANENT, OBJ_EXCLUSIVE, and OBJ_OPENIF attributes are not valid attributes for a thread object. If the caller is not running in the system process context, it must set the OBJ_KERNEL_HANDLE attribute in the <b>OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES</b> structure.

`ProcessHandle`

An open handle for the process in whose address space the created thread is to run. The caller's thread must have PROCESS_CREATE_THREAD access to this process. If this parameter is <b>NULL</b>, the thread will be created in the initial system process. This parameter should be <b>NULL</b> for a driver-created thread. Use the <b>NtCurrentProcess</b> macro, defined in the Wdm.h header file, to specify the current process.

`ClientId`

A pointer to a structure to which the routine writes the client identifier for the created thread. This parameter should be <b>NULL</b> for a driver-created thread.

`StartRoutine`

A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564627">ThreadStart</a> routine that is the entry point for the created thread.

`StartContext`

A context pointer that is passed as the <i>StartContext</i> parameter to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564627">ThreadStart</a> routine when the created thread starts to run.


## Return Value

<b>IoCreateSystemThread</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the new thread was successfully created. Possible return values include the following error status codes.
<table>

<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>

<td width="40%">

<td width="60%">

## Remarks

Starting with Windows 8, a driver can call <b>IoCreateSystemThread</b> to create a device-dedicated thread.
     This routine creates a new system thread that has no thread environment block (TEB) or user-mode context, and runs only in kernel mode.

Typically, the driver calls <b>IoCreateSystemThread</b> either when it starts the device, or when the driver's <i>Dispatch</i>Xxx routines start to receive I/O requests. For example, a driver might call this routine to create a thread when a <i>Dispatch</i>Xxx routine receives an asynchronous device control request.

If the <i>ProcessHandle</i> parameter is <b>NULL</b>, the created thread is associated with the system process. Such a thread continues running until either the system is shut down or the thread exits.

Driver routines that run in a process context other than that of the system process must set the OBJ_KERNEL_HANDLE attribute for the <i>ObjectAttributes</i> parameter of <b>IoCreateSystemThread</b>. This attribute restricts the use of the handle returned by <b>IoCreateSystemThread</b> to processes running in kernel mode. Otherwise, the thread handle could be accessed by the process in whose context the driver is running. Drivers can call the <a href="..\wudfwdm\nf-wudfwdm-initializeobjectattributes.md">InitializeObjectAttributes</a> macro to set the OBJ_KERNEL_HANDLE attribute in the object attributes, as shown in the following code example.
<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES ObjectAttributes;

InitializeObjectAttributes(&amp;ObjectAttributes, NULL, OBJ_KERNEL_HANDLE, NULL, NULL);</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div><b>IoCreateSystemThread</b> is similar to the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-pscreatesystemthread.md">PsCreateSystemThread</a> routine, but has an additional parameter, <i>IoObject</i>, which is a pointer to the caller's driver object or device object. <b>IoCreateSystemThread</b> uses this parameter to ensure that the driver cannot unload while the created thread exists. Before scheduling <i>StartRoutine</i> to run in this thread, <b>IoCreateSystemThread</b> takes a counted reference to the <i>IoObject</i> object. The I/O manager releases this reference after the created thread exits. Thus, this object persists for the lifetime of the created thread.

In contrast to a system thread that is created by the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-pscreatesystemthread.md">PsCreateSystemThread</a> routine, a thread created by <b>IoCreateSystemThread</b> does not call the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-psterminatesystemthread.md">PsTerminateSystemThread</a> routine to terminate itself. Instead, the I/O manager calls <b>PsTerminateSystemThread</b> on behalf of the created thread when the thread exits.
