# KeDeregisterProcessorChangeCallback function
The <b>KeDeregisterProcessorChangeCallback</b> routine unregisters a callback function that was previously registered with the operating system by calling the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553120">KeRegisterProcessorChangeCallback</a> routine.

## Syntax

```
void KeDeregisterProcessorChangeCallback(
  PVOID CallbackHandle
);
```

## Parameters

`CallbackHandle`

The callback registration handle that was returned by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553120">KeRegisterProcessorChangeCallback</a> routine when the callback function was registered with the operating system.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

A device driver calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553120">KeRegisterProcessorChangeCallback</a> routine to register a callback function with the operating system so that the operating system will notify the driver when a new processor is added to the hardware partition. When the device driver no longer needs to receive notification when new processors are added to the hardware paritition, it calls the <b>KeDeregisterProcessorChangeCallback</b> routine to unregister the callback function. A callback function that has been registered for notification of processor changes must be unregistered before the device driver is unloaded from the operating system.
