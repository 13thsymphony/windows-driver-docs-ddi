# _CM_PARTIAL_RESOURCE_LIST structure
The <b>CM_PARTIAL_RESOURCE_LIST</b> structure specifies a set of system hardware resources, of various types, assigned to a device. This structure is contained within a <a href="..\wudfwdm\ns-wudfwdm-_cm_full_resource_descriptor.md">CM_FULL_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</a> structure.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _CM_PARTIAL_RESOURCE_LIST {
  USHORT                         Version;
  USHORT                         Revision;
  ULONG                          Count;
  CM_PARTIAL_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR PartialDescriptors[1];
} CM_PARTIAL_RESOURCE_LIST, *PCM_PARTIAL_RESOURCE_LIST;
````

## Members


`Count`

The number of elements contained in the <b>PartialDescriptors</b> array.

`PartialDescriptors`

The first element in an array of one or more <a href="..\wudfwdm\ns-wudfwdm-_cm_partial_resource_descriptor.md">CM_PARTIAL_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</a> structures.

`Revision`

The revision of this structure. This value should be 1.

`Version`

The version number of this structure. This value should be 1.

## Remarks
This structure is the header for an array of <b>CM_PARTIAL_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</b> structures. The <b>PartialDescriptors</b> member contains the first element in this array, and the <b>Count</b> member specifies the total number of array elements. If the array contains more than one element, the remaining elements in the array immediately follow the <b>CM_PARTIAL_RESOURCE_LIST</b> structure in memory. The total number of bytes occupied by the <b>CM_PARTIAL_RESOURCE_LIST</b> structure and any array elements that follow this structure is <b>sizeof</b>(<b>CM_PARTIAL_RESOURCE_LIST</b>) + (<b>Count</b> - 1) * <b>sizeof</b>(<b>CM_PARTIAL_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</b>).
