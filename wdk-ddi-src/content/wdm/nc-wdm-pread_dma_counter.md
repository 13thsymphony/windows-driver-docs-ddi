# PREAD_DMA_COUNTER callback function
The <b>ReadDmaCounter</b> routine returns the number of bytes remaining to be transferred during the current subordinate DMA operation.

## Syntax

```
PREAD_DMA_COUNTER PreadDmaCounter;

ULONG PreadDmaCounter(
  PDMA_ADAPTER DmaAdapter
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`DmaAdapter`

Pointer to the adapter object previously returned by <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iogetdmaadapter.md">IoGetDmaAdapter</a> representing the system DMA controller channel currently in use.


## Return Value

<b>ReadDmaCounter</b> returns the number of bytes remaining to be transferred in the current DMA operation.

## Remarks

<b>ReadDmaCounter</b>
           is not a system routine that can be called directly by name. This routine is callable only by pointer from the address returned in a 
          <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_dma_operations.md">DMA_OPERATIONS</a>
           structure. Drivers obtain the address of this routine by calling <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-iogetdmaadapter.md">IoGetDmaAdapter</a>.

<b>ReadDmaCounter</b> can be called only by drivers of subordinate DMA devices. Usually, the caller is the driver of a subordinate device that uses a system DMA controller's autoinitialize mode.
