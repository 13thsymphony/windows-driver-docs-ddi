# PO_FX_COMPONENT_CRITICAL_TRANSITION_CALLBACK function



## -description
The <i>ComponentCriticalTransitionCallback</i> callback routine handles a transition of the specified component between the F0 (fully on) and low-power F<i>x</i> component power states.



## -syntax

````
PO_FX_COMPONENT_CRITICAL_TRANSITION_CALLBACK ComponentCriticalTransitionCallback;

VOID ComponentCriticalTransitionCallback(
  _In_ PVOID   Context,
  _In_ ULONG   Component,
  _In_ BOOLEAN Active
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param Context [in]

A pointer to the device context. The device driver uses this context to store information about the current power state of the device. This context is driver-defined and is opaque to PoFx. The driver specified this pointer in the <b>DeviceContext</b> member of the <a href="..\pepfx\ns-pepfx-_po_fx_core_device.md">PO_FX_CORE_DEVICE</a> structure that the driver used to register the device with the Windows <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/B08F8ABF-FD43-434C-A345-337FBB799D9B">power management framework</a> (PoFx).


### -param Component [in]

The index that identifies the component. This parameter is an index into the <b>Components</b> array in the <b>PO_FX_CORE_DEVICE</b> structure that the device driver used to register the device with PoFx. If the <b>Components</b> array contains N elements, component indexes range from 0 to N–1.


### -param Active [in]

Indicates whether this notification is for a transition to the F0 component power state. If TRUE, the component has just completed a transition from a low-power F<i>x</i> state to F0. If FALSE, the component is about to start a transition from F0 to a low-power F<i>x</i> state.


## -returns
None.


## -remarks
This callback routine is implemented by a device driver, and is called by PoFx. PoFx calls this routine to notify the driver of power transitions of device components.

The <b>ComponentCriticalTransitionCallback</b> member of the <a href="..\pepfx\ns-pepfx-_po_fx_core_device.md">PO_FX_CORE_DEVICE</a> structure is a pointer to a <i>ComponentCriticalTransitionCallback</i> callback routine. A pointer to a <b>PO_FX_CORE_DEVICE</b> structure is passed as an input parameter in the PoFxRegisterCoreDevice call that registers a core device with the Windows <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/B08F8ABF-FD43-434C-A345-337FBB799D9B">power management framework</a> (PoFx).

To handle calls to this routine, the device driver saves or restores the register state or other hardware context of the specified component in the device.

If <i>Active</i> = TRUE, PoFx has called this routine <i>after</i> the component completed a transition from a low-power F<i>x</i> state to F0. In this call, the routine restores the previously saved hardware context of the component.

If <i>Active</i> = FALSE, PoFx has called this routine <i>before</i> the component starts a pending transition from F0 to a low-power F<i>x</i> state. In this call, the routine saves the component's hardware context so that this context can later be restored.

For more information about F<i>x</i> component power states, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh450935">Component-Level Power Management</a>.

A PEP can call this routine at IRQL TBD.
