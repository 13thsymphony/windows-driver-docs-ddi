# MM_MDL_ROUTINE callback function
A driver-supplied callback routine that is invoked after a memory descriptor
    list (MDL)  is mapped by calling the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-mmmapmdl.md">MmMapMdl</a> function.

## Syntax

```
MM_MDL_ROUTINE MmMdlRoutine;

void MmMdlRoutine(
  PVOID DriverContext,
  PVOID MappedVa
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`DriverContext`

A pointer to a driver-defined context. The driver's callback function can store any status information  in the driver context and then examine the value, when the callback is invoked.

`MappedVa`

A pointer to a buffer that contains the system virtual address of the
        mapping.


## Return Value

This callback function does not return a value.
