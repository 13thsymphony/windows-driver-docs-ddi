# PCANCEL_ADAPTER_CHANNEL callback function
The <b>CancelAdapterChannel</b> routine tries to cancel a pending request to  allocate a DMA channel.

## Syntax

```
PCANCEL_ADAPTER_CHANNEL PcancelAdapterChannel;

BOOLEAN PcancelAdapterChannel(
  PDMA_ADAPTER DmaAdapter,
  PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject,
  PVOID DmaTransferContext
)
{...}
```

## Parameters

`DmaAdapter`

A pointer to a <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_dma_adapter.md">DMA_ADAPTER</a> structure. This structure is the adapter object that is waiting for the pending resource allocation request to be granted. The caller obtained this pointer from a previous call to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549220">IoGetDmaAdapter</a> routine, and the caller passed this pointer to the <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pallocate_adapter_channel_ex.md">AllocateAdapterChannelEx</a>, <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pget_scatter_gather_list_ex.md">GetScatterGatherListEx</a>, or <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pbuild_scatter_gather_list_ex.md">BuildScatterGatherListEx</a> call that requested the resource allocation.

`DeviceObject`

A pointer to a <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_device_object.md">DEVICE_OBJECT</a> structure. This structure is the physical device object (PDO) that represents the target device for the DMA operation for which the DMA channel was requested.

`DmaTransferContext`

A pointer to a DMA transfer context. This parameter value must be the same DMA transfer context that was passed to the <b>AllocateAdapterChannelEx</b>, <b>GetScatterGatherListEx</b>, or <b>BuildScatterGatherListEx</b> call that requested the adapter channel allocation.


## Return Value

<b>CancelAdapterChannel</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the pending allocation request is successfully canceled. The routine returns <b>FALSE</b> if the request could not be canceled (for example, because the DMA channel was allocated before the request could be canceled).

## Remarks

<b>CancelAdapterChannel</b><i> is not a system routine that can be called directly by name. This routine can be called only by pointer from the address returned in a </i><a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_dma_operations.md">DMA_OPERATIONS</a><i> structure. </i>Drivers obtain the address of this routine by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549220">IoGetDmaAdapter</a> with the <b>Version</b> member of the <i>DeviceDescription</i> parameter set to DEVICE_DESCRIPTION_VERSION3. If <b>IoGetDmaAdapter</b> returns <b>NULL</b>, the routine is not available on your platform.

<b>CancelAdapterChannel</b> tries to cancel a pending allocation request that was made by an asynchronous call to an allocation routine  such as <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pallocate_adapter_channel_ex.md">AllocateAdapterChannelEx</a>, <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pget_scatter_gather_list_ex.md">GetScatterGatherListEx</a>, or <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-pbuild_scatter_gather_list_ex.md">BuildScatterGatherListEx</a>. When called asynchronously, the allocation routine can return while the allocation request is still pending and before the driver-supplied execution routine (<a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-driver_control.md">AdapterControl</a> or <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-driver_list_control.md">AdapterListControl</a>) is called. If <b>CancelAdapterChannel</b> successfully cancels the pending allocation request, the resources are not allocated and the execution routine is not called.

If a driver calls <b>AllocateAdapterChannelEx</b> to request resources for a driver-supplied <i>AdapterControl</i> routine, and then calls <b>CancelAdapterChannel</b> to cancel the request, <b>CancelAdapterChannel</b> can return one of the following values:
<ul>
<li>
<b>TRUE</b>, if the adapter object is waiting for the requested allocation when the <b>CancelAdapterChannel</b> call occurs. In this case, <b>CancelAdapterChannel</b> cancels the pending allocation request, and the driver's <i>AdapterControl</i> routine is not called.

</li>
<li>
<b>FALSE</b>, if the <i>AdapterControl</i> routine was already called or is about to be called.

</li>
</ul>Similarly, if a driver calls <b>GetScatterGatherListEx</b> or <b>BuildScatterGatherListEx</b> to request resources for a driver-supplied <i>AdapterListControl</i> routine, and then calls <b>CancelAdapterChannel</b> to cancel the request, <b>CancelAdapterChannel</b> can return one of the following values:
<ul>
<li>
<b>TRUE</b>, if the adapter object is waiting for the requested allocation when the <b>CancelAdapterChannel</b> call occurs. In this case, <b>CancelAdapterChannel</b> cancels the pending allocation request, and the driver's <i>AdapterListControl</i> routine is not called.

</li>
<li>
<b>FALSE</b>, if the <i>AdapterListControl</i> routine was already called or is about to be called.

</li>
</ul><b>CancelAdapterChannel</b> can preemptively cancel future channel allocation requests that use the specified DMA transfer context. For example, if the caller supplies the same DMA transfer context to <b>CancelAdapterChannel</b> and <b>AllocateAdapterChannelEx</b>, and the <b>CancelAdapterChannel</b> call is successful and occurs before the <b>AllocateAdapterChannelEx</b> call, the allocation requested by the <b>AllocateAdapterChannelEx</b> call is automatically canceled.
