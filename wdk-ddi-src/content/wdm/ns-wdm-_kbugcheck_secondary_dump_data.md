# _KBUGCHECK_SECONDARY_DUMP_DATA structure



## -description
The <b>KBUGCHECK_SECONDARY_DUMP_DATA</b> structure describes a section of driver-supplied data to be written by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540679">BugCheckSecondaryDumpDataCallback</a> to the crash dump file.



## -syntax

````
typedef struct _KBUGCHECK_SECONDARY_DUMP_DATA {
  PVOID InBuffer;
  ULONG InBufferLength;
  ULONG MaximumAllowed;
  GUID  Guid;
  PVOID OutBuffer;
  ULONG OutBufferLength;
} KBUGCHECK_SECONDARY_DUMP_DATA, *PKBUGCHECK_SECONDARY_DUMP_DATA;
````


## -struct-fields

### -field InBuffer

Pointer to a buffer that is allocated by the system.


### -field InBufferLength

Specifies the size of the buffer, in bytes, specified by the <b>InBuffer</b> member.


### -field MaximumAllowed

Specifies the maximum amount of data that the <i>BugCheckSecondaryDumpDataCallback</i> routine can write to the crash dump file.


### -field Guid

Specifies a GUID that identifies the driver's crash dump data. (Drivers must use unique GUIDs to mark their crash dump data. Use the GuidGen.exe tool to generate GUIDs for your driver. This tool is included in the Microsoft Windows SDK.)


### -field OutBuffer

Pointer to the buffer where the driver writes its crash dump data, or <b>NULL</b>.


### -field OutBufferLength

Specifies the size of the buffer, in bytes, that was specified by the <b>OutBuffer</b> member.
