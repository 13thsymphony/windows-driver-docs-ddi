# _FILE_POSITION_INFORMATION structure
The <b>FILE_POSITION_INFORMATION</b> structure is used as an argument to routines that query or set file information.

## Syntax
````
typedef struct _FILE_POSITION_INFORMATION {
  LARGE_INTEGER CurrentByteOffset;
} FILE_POSITION_INFORMATION, *PFILE_POSITION_INFORMATION;
````

## Members


`CurrentByteOffset`

The byte offset of the current file pointer.

## Remarks
FILE_READ_DATA or FILE_WRITE_DATA access to the file is required to change this information about the file, and the file must be opened for synchronous I/O.

If the file was opened or created with the FILE_NO_INTERMEDIATE_BUFFERING option, the value of <b>CurrentByteOffset</b> must be an integral multiple of the sector size of the underlying device.

## Requirements
