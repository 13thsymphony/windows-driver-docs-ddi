# _D3COLD_LAST_TRANSITION_STATUS Enumeration
The <b>D3COLD_LAST_TRANSITION_STATUS</b> enumeration indicates whether the most recent transition to the D3hot device power state was followed by a transition to the D3cold device power state.

## Syntax
```
typedef enum _D3COLD_LAST_TRANSITION_STATUS {
  LastDStateTransitionStatusUnknown  ,
  LastDStateTransitionD3hot          ,
  LastDStateTransitionD3cold
} *PD3COLD_LAST_TRANSITION_STATUS, D3COLD_LAST_TRANSITION_STATUS;
```

## Constants

<table>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>LastDStateTransitionStatusUnknown</td>
                    <td>Information is not available from the bus driver or platform firmware about whether the most recent transition to D3hot was followed by a transition to D3cold.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>LastDStateTransitionD3hot</td>
                    <td>The most recent transition to the D3hot device power state was not followed by a transition to the D3cold device power state.</td>
                </tr>
            
                <tr>
                    <td>LastDStateTransitionD3cold</td>
                    <td>The most recent transition to the D3hot device power state was followed by a transition to the D3cold device power state.</td>
                </tr>
</table>
