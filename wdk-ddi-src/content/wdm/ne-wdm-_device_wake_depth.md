# _DEVICE_WAKE_DEPTH enumeration



## -description
The <b>DEVICE_WAKE_DEPTH</b> enumeration specifies the deepest device power state from which a device can trigger a wake signal.



## -syntax

````
typedef enum _DEVICE_WAKE_DEPTH { 
  DeviceWakeDepthNotWakeable  = 0,
  DeviceWakeDepthD0,
  DeviceWakeDepthD1,
  DeviceWakeDepthD2,
  DeviceWakeDepthD3hot,
  DeviceWakeDepthD3cold,
  DeviceWakeDepthMaximum
} DEVICE_WAKE_DEPTH;
````


## -enum-fields

### -field DeviceWakeDepthNotWakeable

There is no device power state that can trigger a wake signal.


### -field DeviceWakeDepthD0

D0 is the deepest device power state from which the device can trigger a wake signal. For more information, see Remarks.


### -field DeviceWakeDepthD1

D1 is the deepest low-power device power state from which the device can trigger a wake signal.


### -field DeviceWakeDepthD2

D2 is the deepest low-power device power state from which the device can trigger a wake signal.


### -field DeviceWakeDepthD3hot

D3hot is the deepest low-power device power state from which the device can trigger a wake signal.


### -field DeviceWakeDepthD3cold

D3cold is the deepest low-power device power state from which the device can trigger a wake signal.


### -field DeviceWakeDepthMaximum

Reserved for use by the operating system.


## -remarks
The <i>DeepestWakeableDstate</i> parameter of the <a href="..\wdm\nc-wdm-get_idle_wake_info.md">GetIdleWakeInfo</a> routine is a pointer to a variable of type <b>DEVICE_WAKE_DEPTH</b>.

The drivers for most devices have no reason to arm a wake signal when the device is in D0. These drivers can treat the <b>DeviceWakeDepthD0</b> output value as equivalent to a call to the <i>GetIdleWakeInfo</i> routine that fails and returns an error status.
