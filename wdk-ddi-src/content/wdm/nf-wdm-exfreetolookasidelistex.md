# ExFreeToLookasideListEx function
The <b>ExFreeToLookasideListEx</b> routine inserts an entry into a lookaside list, or, if the list is full, frees the allocated storage for the entry.

## Syntax

````
VOID ExFreeToLookasideListEx(
  _Inout_ PLOOKASIDE_LIST_EX Lookaside,
  _In_    PVOID              Entry
);
````

## Parameters

`Lookaside`

A pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554329">LOOKASIDE_LIST_EX</a> structure that describes a lookaside list. This structure was previously initialized by the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exinitializelookasidelistex.md">ExInitializeLookasideListEx</a> routine.

`Entry`

A pointer to the lookaside-list entry that is being freed.


## Return Value

None

## Remarks

This routine frees a lookaside-list entry that was allocated by a previous call to the <a href="..\wdm\nf-wdm-exallocatefromlookasidelistex.md">ExAllocateFromLookasideListEx</a> routine. <b>ExFreeToLookasideListEx</b> inserts the entry into the specified lookaside list, if space for the entry is available in the list. If the list is full (that is, it already contains the maximum number of entries, as determined by the operating system), <b>ExFreeToLookasideListEx</b> calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554324">LookasideListFreeEx</a> routine to free the storage for the specified entry, if the driver has provided such a routine. Otherwise, a default deallocation routine is used to free the entry.

For more information about lookaside lists, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565416">Using Lookaside Lists</a>.
