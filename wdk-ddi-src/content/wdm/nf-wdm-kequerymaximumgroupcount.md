# KeQueryMaximumGroupCount function
The <b>KeQueryMaximumGroupCount</b> routine returns the maximum number of groups in a multiprocessor system.

## Syntax

````
USHORT KeQueryMaximumGroupCount(void);
````

## Parameters

This function has no parameters.

## Return Value

<b>KeQueryMaximumGroupCount</b> returns the maximum number of groups.

## Remarks

The value that is returned by <b>KeQueryMaximumGroupCount</b> remains constant during runtime. This value depends on the hardware configuration of the multiprocessor system, but it can never exceed a fixed limit that is set by the Windows operating system.

In Windows 7, the maximum number of groups in a multiprocessor system is four, but this value might change in future versions of Windows. The safest way to determine the maximum number of groups in Windows 7 or a later versions of the Windows operating system is to call <b>KeQueryMaximumGroupCount</b>. Kernel-mode drivers that call <b>KeQueryMaximumGroupCount</b> will not require code changes if the formula that is used to calculate the maximum number of groups changes in a future version of Windows.

To obtain the number of active groups in a multiprocessor system, call the <a href="..\ntddk\nf-ntddk-kequeryactivegroupcount.md">KeQueryActiveGroupCount</a> routine.
