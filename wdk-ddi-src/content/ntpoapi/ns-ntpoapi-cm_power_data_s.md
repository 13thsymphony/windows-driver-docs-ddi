# CM_Power_Data_s structure
The <b>CM_POWER_DATA</b> structure contains information about a device's power management state and capabilities.

## Members


`PD_Capabilities`

The device's power capabilities, represented by a combination of the following bit flags:

PDCAP_D0_SUPPORTED

PDCAP_D1_SUPPORTED

PDCAP_D2_SUPPORTED

PDCAP_D3_SUPPORTED

PDCAP_WAKE_FROM_D0_SUPPORTED

PDCAP_WAKE_FROM_D1_SUPPORTED

PDCAP_WAKE_FROM_D2_SUPPORTED

PDCAP_WAKE_FROM_D3_SUPPORTED

PDCAP_WARM_EJECT_SUPPORTED

`PD_D1Latency`

The device's latency when returning the D0 state from the D1 state. For more information, see the <b>D1Latency</b> member of <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_device_capabilities.md">DEVICE_CAPABILITIES</a>.

`PD_D2Latency`

The device's latency when returning the D0 state from the D2 state. For more information, see the <b>D2Latency</b> member of <b>DEVICE_CAPABILITIES</b>.

`PD_D3Latency`

The device's latency when returning the D0 state from the D3 state. For more information, see the <b>D3Latency</b> member of <b>DEVICE_CAPABILITIES</b>.

`PD_DeepestSystemWake`

Specifies the least-powered system state from which the device can wake the system. <b>PD_DeepestSystemWake</b> typically indicates one of the system sleeping states, S1, S2, or S3 (as specified by <b>PowerSystemSleeping1</b>, <b>PowerSystemSleeping2</b>, and <b>PowerSystemSleeping3</b>, respectively). Note, however, that some devices might be able to wake the system from the system hibernate state, S4 (as specified by <b>PowerSystemHibernate</b>), or even from the system shutdown state, S5 (as specified by <b>PowerSystemShutdown</b>).

`PD_MostRecentPowerState`

A <a href="..\wudfddi\ne-wudfddi-_device_power_state.md">DEVICE_POWER_STATE</a> value representing the device's most recent power state.

`PD_PowerStateMapping`

An array of <b>DEVICE_POWER_STATE</b> values representing the maximum device power state achievable for each system power state. For more information, see the <b>DeviceState</b> member of <a href="..\wdm\ns-wdm-_device_capabilities.md">DEVICE_CAPABILITIES</a>.

`PD_Size`

The size, in bytes, of this structure.
