# RxCeTearDownVC function



## -description
<b>RxCeTearDownVC</b> deregisters a virtual circuit from a specified RDBSS connection.



## -syntax

````
NTSTATUS RxCeTearDownVC(
  _In_ PRXCE_VC pVc
);
````


## -parameters

### -param pVc [in]

A pointer to a handle for an virtual circuit structure to be torn down. 


## -returns
<b>RxCeTearDownVC</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS on success or one of the following error codes on failure: 
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</b></dt>
</dl>One of the parameters passed to this routine was invalid. 

 


## -remarks
When <b>RxCeTearDownVC</b> is successful, the data members in the RXCE_VC structure pointed to by the <i>pVC</i> parameter will be properly uninitialized and the virtual circuit will be disconnected from the associated RDBSS transport, address, and connection. 

Note that <b>RxCeTearDownVC</b> will wait for the clean up of connections over other transports to be completed before returning.

<b>RxCeTearDownVC</b> calls TDI to disconnect the virtual circuit associated with a connection. If the call to TDI is unsuccessful, <b>RxCeTearDownVC</b> will return the error from the TDI routine call.
